28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old cook, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a supermarket stairwell.
But the Upura brother says that he can’t imagine anyone who would like to pass on to his brother, pointing out that: “His life has finally begun to improve.”
The statue, which was found at the Westfield supermarket on Wednesday, was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, said a representative of the San Francisco Court of Justice’s Office of Medical Expertise.
The San Francisco police said that his death was recognised as a homicide and an investigation is currently under way.
Upura's brother, Luis Galicia, tells ABC KGO of San Francisco that Franks had previously worked for a chef in Boston, but six months ago he was at his dream job restaurant "Sons & Daughters" in San Francisco.
The representative of the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" informs that the news of his death shocked and struck them.
"We are a small team that works as a foster family and we are very much missing him," the representative said.
In this difficult time, we think we are together with Frank's friends and family.
Luis Galicia says that in the beginning Franks was staying in hostels, but lately life has finally improved in being.
"He was hiding in a new apartment and meeting a girl," Luis told KGO radio station.
Luis Galicia claims that he does not know who would like to take over his younger brother.
He was a good man with a big heart.
"He always pampered his family by preparing delicious meals and preparing lunches," said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to get involved in a dispute.
He was the brother who adapted to the others.
"Given everything that went wrong in the world, he was like an untreated smoker that glowed every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about what happened is invited to call the SFPD Information Telephone 415-575-4444.
New doctors strike: calls for new protests
The representatives of the new doctors ask their trade union to start protests in the dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association (LMA) Committee of Young Physicians (JAK) is about to request advice to support wider protests in early September.
JAK believes that the ministers have failed to raise doubts about the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the LMA.
58 % of all members who took part in the vote voted against the agreement.
On Thursday evening, a member of the JAK Council, El<0xC4><0x93>na Makkorta, said that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore the contract offer has been rejected.
She said: "In view of this, as a result of the JAK vote, the offer of the contract has been completely rejected and a decision has been taken to request new formal talks to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government's silence, JAK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorize the development of new contracts that would enter into force in September.
As a result of the fight, the young doctors took part in six strikes, including for the first time in the history of the NHS.
After the vote rejecting the terms of the contract proposed by the LMA, recommended by the BMA, Dr. Johans Malawana, the new LMA doctor, resigned.
Before meeting with 54,000 young doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer is good and will be accepted.
After the vote, the Secretary of Health, Jeremy Hunts, informed that the contract would be concluded with the British doctors.
Russia and Turkey: The Allies of Attumto?
A gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to discuss and announce the end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But Vladimir Putin, congratulating the Turkish leader in St. Petersburg, came to the impression that these partnerships are more needed for Ankara.
However, the two chatted.
Vladimir Putin’s smile looked collected and did not cause warm emotions, even in view of his usual restraint.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an has at least five times denounced Putin for his "dear friend", a review of the meeting of the message.
We're going to get the number down.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only improve to the pre-crisis level, but will become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan would behave as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm is causing conflicting feelings.
However, Putin’s radiant glow shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the destruction of the Russian aircraft on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow responded to the matter.
Putin accused Ankara of being involved in the downfall in the Moscow border.
The procedure was even more painful, given that it came from a friend.
The restoration of true trust will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Since November, Russia’s public position has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television has spread aggressive insults against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed like the Turks were guilty of everything.
The most serious were allegations that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from the illegal trade in oil with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He himself, of course, denied it.
However, the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that the time has come to forget the past.
In the end, this meeting took place only because Putin received President Erdogan’s apology.
Russia could see it as a kind of victory.
The benefits of Ankara’s peace deal are obvious.
First, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an needs all possible friends after a failed coup in the past month in which he was trying to gas.
In addition, countless terrorist attacks have shaken his positions as well.
There are also economic reasons.
Russia’s sanctions have caused substantial losses, especially the ban on charter routes, which usually provide for the influx of several million Russian tourists into Turkish resorts each year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Also, Russian tour operators and charter companies facilitate the use of Uzbeks when regular flights are renewed.
They hope for a holiday in the Mediterranean according to the season.
Already this week, national TV plans to reduce the prices of fruit and vegetables, as Turkish fruit and vegetable imports will be renewed.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti says: "Tourists to them, tomatoes to us."
But the visit also had other political motives on the part of Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for, they think, a weak reaction to the attempted coup.
There can also be dissatisfaction with the protracted negotiations on the accession of the EU and Putin's intervention, which is a good example of Turkey's reluctance to withdraw from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly gained additional points in Ankara’s eyes, expressing support for its elected government after an attempted coup.
Take into account that Moscow understands this well, because in itself there is a deep-seated fear of regime change in the country.
The summit, which took place in this grotto in the seaside castle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present the forces of the two countries, which feel alienated from the West, as was denounced by an analyst.
However, despite the unity that has been publicly demonstrated, there are still considerable differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreements affect Syria, where Russia presents itself as a bearer of peace, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, the two presidents announced at the press conference that they had not discussed the matter, despite not wanting to disclose information.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided issues of disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus as to how the two countries could find a common language on the Syrian issue.
However, after months of openly negative relations and potential catastrophes when a NATO member Turkey entered the Russian warplane, the situation has improved, as the two leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland
SKB will continue to play a supporting role, the Executive Director of the Bank said.
Outside of Scotland, SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makevans tells the BBC in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank’s global ambitions.
It has given up on these ambitions, because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and it needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, experts in the branding strategy have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank has received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, starting with the Six Nations registrar and finally with Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
However, it is now decided to put other national brands in the foreground.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, other than the head office and official stock exchange list, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The brand The Ulster Bank is already used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Now you will also pay attention to smaller private financial brands such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Makevans was interviewed during the trip with customers and employees through Inverness.
He told the BBC Scotland channel: "SKB will become the brand of our investors and with which our employees work, because now we become more of a brand bank."
Over time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have a global ambition, we have a local level of ambition.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring the Six Nations and will be involved in sponsoring various brands of sport.
"It's time to become a brand bank, because we've already asked ourselves the question of how to become a better bank for our customers?" says the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we had announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
However, thanks to hard work and focusing on customer needs rather than our own needs, we have obviously made a big change.
We can revive these brands again, so I think now is the right time.
Frankie Detori wins the 3000th win by taking first place in the New Market with a horse Predilection
Detori picks up the champagnes by winning his 3000th victory by finishing twice in the first race in Newmarket.
On Friday, the jockey Frankie Detori won his 3000th victory in the history of Great Britain, earning his first place in the New Market.
He achieved this by winning a second victory in these races, which took place in his hometown, having to ride with the Predilection coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to have achieved such a result in horse racing.
He has joined Seram Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigot, Fifth Eder, and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Detori, who had previously won with the horse Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."
I am very excited because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because I have been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not Royal Ascot, but a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After the victory Detori and Predilection are expected with applause and applause.
Two jockeys have achieved this record in obstacles races - champion Richard Johnson and 20-time champion Sir Antony McCoy, who has set several records in his career, winning more than 4,300 wins.
Lester Pigots, the ninth derby winner, has won 4493 victories over the course of his career.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of today and it is no surprise that he has achieved success, which only rarely can be achieved.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactics make him different from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic racing representative, his enthusiasm and charisma attracts fans for years to this sport.
A few weeks ago at the Epsom race, I told Frankie that he would have won 6,000 victories if he hadn't participated in just a week's race and big races.
However, seriously speaking, it is a real joy that for 30 years, Frankie has been winning regular races in the United Kingdom.
He is lively, which is great for British racing, in addition, he is an excellent jockey.
Frank Dettori noted this achievement with his signature - a flying shot.
From finishing wind speed to flying descent, Frankie Detori has been the face of British horse racing for twenty years.
This has been the full path of adventure.
He has won countless major races, including the famous 1996 "Great Seven" in Askot, in addition to having survived the plane crash and disqualification for the use of preparations.
Three years ago, it was difficult for him to return after a six-month disqualification, but he demonstrated the strength of his character by challenging those who doubted him by returning to his best form.
And he could participate in the races for a while longer - Detori has previously stated that he would like to continue participating in the races for at least 50 years.
Russia’s President Putin dismisses the head of the administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed the head of the administration Sergey Ivanov.
For many years, Ivanov was found in the vicinity of Putin’s closest people.
Currently, a 63-year-old politician has been appointed as a special representative in the field of nature and transport.
In a statement, the Kremlin said that Putin "decided to free Ivanov from the duties of the head of the administration of the Russian president", without mentioning the reason.
Instead of Ivanova, Anton Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012.
44-year-old Vaino is a disgraced diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, and graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
As reported on the Kremlin website (in Russian), he later managed the Presidential minutes and the administration of government officials.
After his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your work in the office of President of the State, by drawing up laws and controlling the execution of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian news agency on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave office and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
Is the smile convincing?
This step has confused Moscow.
Sergey Ivanovs is Vladimir Putin’s ally and, like Putin, worked for the Soviet Security Service in his time.
In this position he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a televised meeting, the two men announced that Ivanov was resigning on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles on the cameras, rarely confirmed by such an explanation, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this an outcome related to the struggle for power?
No one knows.
However, the official statement that the man, who was considered a possible president, suddenly wanted to become the head of Russia’s environmental policy, is perceived with great skepticism.
In the comments published on the Kremlin website, Ivanovs says to Putin: "It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012, I ask you to entrust me with this complex position, I might even say, a problematic position, four years.
It turns out that I have worked in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He was previously Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former employee of the State Security Service of the Russian Federation, like Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of the VDK, Ivanovs took the position of his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted the most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the presidency of Russia, as Putin's transition to the third term would be unconstitutional.
But then another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, became the president.
Putin became prime minister, and after three and a half years returned to the presidency.
The appearance of soft fish in a garden in the city of Banfas
A man from Banff asks for help to find out the circumstances of the fish species that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Beins thinks that 75 fish could be sand dunes that have receded with a water staff .
Mr Beina, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a fish video on the Periscope website, hoping that someone might know how these 5 centimeters of big fish arrived in his garden.
Crossing of the winery: the bridge is now connected to the Faif.
Currently, projects worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion are planned to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Quinsferia crossing and the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faif.
The first of the four connecting parts is completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is approaching the end.
The construction of the Faifa bridge is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
At present, a project worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion is planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keits Brauns had gone to the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said: "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Quinsferia Bridge."
In this project we see an insurmountable engineering solution, where more than 30 000 tons of cement and steel were used in the construction of this part alone.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, the connection of the bridge and the viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
In total, more than 79% of the bridge deck is already built and the last stage connecting the bridge to Rosita will be laid today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for laying.
Michael Martin, Director of the Fourth Bridge Connection Project, says: "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates the engineering construction of the highest class.
After installing the last stage of the road and connecting it with the support of the north tower, we were left to connect the north stage of the road with the ground part or viaduct.
This was done by pushing the northern section of the transit viaduct 700 millimetres south.
It was a huge and at the same time a very delicate operation.
Huge as the pipeline is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to lift the slope by about 3 %.
Delicate, because the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked was only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Simona Bailsa acquires gold in women's exercise.
Forgetting the judge.
Forget about the excitement.
Simone Bailsu is not worried.
Dynamic jumps.
Without effort, perform exercises on the pelvis.
Irreversible on the floor.
Totally harmless.
And finally the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American athlete won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between himself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 points was higher than the result of the silver medal winner and her teammate Aliya Raisman and the bronze medal winner of the Russian athlete Aliya Mustafina.
On Thursday, U.S. athlete Simona Bailsa took part in the individual multi-fight women's multi-stakes final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Fears became the fourth American in a row to have won the multi-fight championship title and the fifth best athlete, gradually strengthening the reputation of being the best coach of its generation and possibly the best coach in the history of the sport.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears, as the long road to this moment was over.
This achievement brought him closer to the unsurpassed athletes such as Michael Felps, who raised his sport to a different level.
During the last three years, he has dominated his sport, winning 15 medals in the world championships, including 10 gold medals, performing such an excellent, precise and ambitious combination of exercises that the 1984 Olympic champion Maria Lu Retone "sawed for him to win".
In Brazil, she was awaited by the last test, where she had to contend to a large extent with the hopes that were placed on her, not with the other athletes.
She would be thrilled if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas, with no gold medals.
U.S. athletes Simona Bailsa (left) and Alija Raismane are injured in the individual women's multi-fight final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal was won by Bailsa on Tuesday, making special selection coordinator Marta Karolji a farewell party.
While Bailsa claims that nothing was expected of him on his long journey to the heights of fame, it is not true.
Part of her performance in the free movement, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which would fit perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympic Games arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl who was adopted by her parents when she was still a baby and discovered by the coach's mother, Eimija Burman, on a trip to the gym, where Burman's sneakers took place, has now become a force to be reckoned with.
She has not lost a multi-fight race since the summer of 2013 and the winning series can go on for as long as Bailsa wants.
Although Mustafina was slightly in control during the two rotations, it was only an illusion.
The balance of the ball and the free movement - part of the competition, where Bailsa will defend his champion title, is still just ahead.
She advanced in front with a score of 15,433 on the score and strengthened the lead with a score of 15,933 in free moves
Raisman greeted her gently as she waited for the results, which was only formality and she poured joy into the tears when the dream, which she had once recorded in her notebook, was fulfilled.
Raisman's result was as a small reluctance to have a four-year old event, when she shared third place with Mustafin, but lost the battle for the bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, whom the Americans call the "grandmother", came under convincing leadership.
After the performance in the free movement, which raised doubts about her return, she was able to devote herself to the effort of air kissing.
At the same time, 19-year-old Bailey’s viral Twitter post r, which she published this week, already has a completely different meaning.
6-year-old Mahajs Braun's "slow shock" survives in a Philadelphia interrogation.
Police report that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, indicating that he is already the second six-year-old to be shot in Philadelphia this week.
The child's parents confirmed to the CBS Philadelphia News Channel that it was Mahjong Brown.
The parents say that Braun was shot several times, including in the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was still at a loss when he was taken to a hospital.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, tells the television: "His little body was just a broken window."
I can't believe it.
The boy in critical condition is placed in the hospital and has already undergone several operations.
The family informs him that he will surely recover.
He had to start going first-class to the local primary school.
Braun is one of the four people who were shot in the city of Germantau.
Three men were also stabbed: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old men is in a critical condition, while the other two sufferers are stable.
The channel reports that the child was found in the front seat of the car near the 29-year-old victim in a critical condition.
The other two victims were not found in the car and police are investigating whether one of them was an assailant.
The investigator informed CBS Philadelphia that a number of shooters were likely to have been involved in the investigation.
At the site of the event, the shells of the gun cartridge, which belong to different weapons, were found.
It seems to have been a long-standing question.
There are bumps on both sides of the pedestrian frame.
"So it looks like there were a number of armed shooters here who actively participated in the interrogation," says Philadelphia Police Captain Antony Ginaldi.
The damage has also been done to several homes and cars.
No one has yet been arrested and it is reported that the police are checking the surveillance camera footage.
On Tuesday, during the interrogation, a 6-year-old girl fell into a coma while she was playing in front of her house in Vestoukleina district.
She slowly recovers, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simon, Gabia and Laurie?
I call it the Women's Olympic Lightweight Team of the Year for a number of reasons.
First, I have been to all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. team has never been so good.
Secondly, this team has three light girls, Simon Bails, Gabia Duglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are inspired by many new girls of origin.
People can be proud that Ali Raisman, who is a Jew, and Madison Cocian, who is a Catholic, is also part of this team.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the last four years, the best trainer is an African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabia took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
At the previous Olympic Games, Gabia Duglas surprisingly became the Olympic champion, and America was able to shine.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises performed by three-time world champion Simon Bails, Duglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing inexperienced but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row to have won a gold medal in the women's individual multi-fight.
Her teammate Alija Raismane won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can give, but the situation in the rest of the country during exercise hours is completely different.
Simona, Gabia and Laurie entered the Olympic Games, as did Ali and Madison.
She is the "Olympic Fifteen", because the next Olympic exercise team will be only four athletes, and this is the last year of coach Marta Karola's work.
In fact, exercise is an expensive sport. Athletes mainly train in private athletic clubs, and they are maintained by parents who pay for workouts, spaces, trips, uniforms, hotels (for coaches, athletes and their families) and other outings.
Most of these athletics clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes carry out all their trainings, and this is an expensive and long-term contribution to the families of the vulnerable.
Eimija B<0xC5><0xAB>rman - Simon Bails coach and Megija Hainija - Laurie Hernandez coach has been training their athletes since the two girls started practicing athletics.
We need to provide young girls who are inspired by Simon, Gabia and Laurie with cheaper training options.
I founded my own athletic organization 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem, and we offer more than 15,000 city youth (mainly black and Spanish) training exercises free of charge or at a low price. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit (my hometown) to provide local youth the opportunity to get to know this great sport.
Lightweight athletics develops the coordination of strength, posture and body, as well as teaching hard work, discipline and ambition to the goal.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team inspires thousands of young girls to train in athletics and this is fantastic.
Working out with this type of sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you Simona, Alija, Gabia and Madison for the excellent demonstration of "Girl Power", winning the Olympic Games gold medals and motivating countless young, diverse girls of different origins to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's offer, the new doctors plan to develop more strikes.
The ministers hoped to end the disagreement by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association, but this was rejected by 58 percent of the 37,000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hants announced plans to conclude the contract, indicating that the NHS is in an unstable state and that further delays will only harm employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes in working conditions at night in shifts and at weekends to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Yesterday evening, the representative of the new doctors of the BMA, Dr. El<0xC4><0x93>na Makourta, said that the young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will deepen the crisis of the workforce and it does not provide for equal conditions for all doctors.
The remaining eight weeks until the moment when the first group of new doctors will sign a new contract, therefore progress must be made, because there is not much time left.
BMA’s efforts to solve the problems along the way of negotiations have been met with the government’s unwillingness to engage and sometimes with complete silence.
This happened despite the fact that last month, Jeremy Hunts stated that his door is always open.
Jeremy Hant has to act immediately , stop the operation , and work with the new doctors .
If he does not, then the new doctors are ready for new protest actions.
During the last strike in late April, more than 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed, while nurses and counselors tried to replace doctors who had gone to the picket.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to increase the rate of work at the end of the week to 54,000 new doctors covered by the new contracts.
The executive director of the NHS, Daniels Mortimers, called on young doctors not to go on strike.
Mr Mortimer explains that the strike does not solve anything, but only raises the pressure on the employees and worries, creates stress and obstacles for patients, caregivers and their families.
In the last two months, we have spoken with the new doctors' committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about guardians and rapporteurs.
Workers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as staff placement, flexible training, in addition to training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programs, school leaving and school leaving
The drug for 2 pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack could be treated with drugs for 2 pounds a day, as official representatives recommend using them for more people and for a longer period of time.
The anticonvulsant drug Ticagrelor reduces the repeated risk of heart attack in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of repeated heart attacks.
The NHS-represented NICE recommends using this drug 4 years after heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with heart and blood problems.
However, NICE, which is currently under the control of the NHS, recommends that this drug be used 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart and blood vessels.
Around 140,000 people in England experience a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them experience repeated heart attacks or strokes.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fats in the walls of the heart, forming constipation.
When the blockage ruptures, it can cause a thrombosis by blocking the blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
On the other hand, if the thrombus separates from the blood vessel wall, it can get further into the bloodstream and block blood access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at greater risk of having a repeated heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombus formation.
The new NICE guidelines, published today, recommend that people take 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and another 3 years at 60 mg twice a day with aspirin.
NICE Health Technology Director Professor Kerola Longson explains: “Despite the fact that there are drugs available to prevent repeated heart attacks, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke that often has serious consequences.”
Fear of repeated heart attacks can leave a negative impact on the quality of human life.
Evidence suggests that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks and heart attacks in people who have already experienced it.
When we provisionally recommend treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to extend the treatment options to thousands of people who are thus beneficiaries.
Given limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding with this medicine for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend that it be used for longer than this period.
A culture of political correctness promotes fraud during elections in Muslim communities
According to the management report, former mayor of the city of Tauerhamlet, Lutfur Rahmans was dismissed from office in connection with corruption.
The government report reveals that as a result of the culture of political correctness, a wide-ranging fraud is being committed in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Erik Pikl criticizes police, election watchdogs and city councils for ignoring the signs of fraud in the election process because "they are afraid of undermining ethnic and religious interests."
The former Community Secretary, who has now become the head of the anti-corruption organisation, says that intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that police should be allowed to place guards at polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also suggests that voters should present a person's supporting document when they vote to prove their true identity.
Currently, voters only need to indicate the name and address.
He even recommends marking the fingers of the voters who voted with a special ink to prevent double voting.
The rapporteurs should also be given greater protection, says Sir Eriks.
He believes that the press should be given greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The goal is not only to prevent fraud of choice, but also to protect local government from the wider corruption and culture of fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was ordered by the Dauningstrit after a scandal in connection with the Tauerhamlet city elections.
Last year, the special election court decided to remove Lutfur Rahman from the city’s office due to corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "Chinesely changed" his Muslim community's religious views and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman ran his election campaign on the premise that it is the religious duty of believers to vote for him."
About 300 votes were false or questionable because one person had voted several times.
Sir Eriks also points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that it is particularly troubling to vote in the mail, where the elders of the Muslim community forced others to vote for their preferred candidates.
Sir Eriks recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a document certifying persons, in order to clarify the identity of the person.
"The evidence shows that unprotected members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote for the community's older elected candidates, especially in Bangladesh and Pakistan communities," he said.
"There is concern that regional authorities are not paying attention to these problems due to political correctness, as ethnic and religious interests could be affected."
Sir Eriks made 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists from voting, which was passed by mail to prevent "voting".
The report, which is being considered by the Mayor of Teréza, also calls for a more thorough registration check to prevent the use of voter lists in the area of immigration and benefits fraud.
Consider asking voters to present a document certifying the person before the vote.
Mark the fingers of the electors with a special ink to prevent double voting.
Systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that the person has the right to vote.
Set a limit of three years for requests for automatic voting by mail.
Prohibit political campaigners and activists from working with votes passed by mail and electoral envelopes for voting by mail.
To provide the police with the powers to appoint protection at the polling stations.
Make changes to the law to facilitate the call of persons to be held responsible for intimidation under the Human Rights Act 1983.
Prohibit photographing elections in the margins.
To establish the requirement to use only English (except in Wales) in the margins of the election.
Reinforce the training to ensure that the voters go to the polling stations one by one.
Sers Eriks ais criticises the Metropolitan Police, expressing the misunderstanding that no charges have been brought in the Tauerhamlet case .
He relates: "The election court only disqualified Lufturu Rahman and his representative for actions related to corruption and fraud."
He was found to be guilty of a standard of criminal evidence, based on irrefutable evidence.
He also criticises the inefficient "chain check" of city hall voters in the margins of voter registration.
Sers Eriks points out: "Last year's court decision is a warning call.
Our country is known as the birthplace of Parliament, but the disturbing and hidden election of the spread of fraud and the institution's emergence that fraud does not endanger this good reputation.
Excitement with a cyclist - Keita's parody and other Rio Olympic celebrity parodies
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics are excited about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevot, who has been recognized by fans as an extremely similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
However, the 24-year-old cyclist is not the only athlete who this summer fights for gold, who, according to the media, is proud of his celebrity counterpart.
That’s why, in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently visible on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympic players who are most similar to the stars of Hollywood.
The hunter and wolf: Breedy Elison, a member of the U.S. archery team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo Di Kaprio since childhood
Despite Keita’s similarities on the cycling route, many people on the internet point out that this archer could be the twin brother of superstar Leonardo Di Caprio.
Breedy Elison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, caused a storm on Twitter when photographs were posted, where he is very similar to Volstritis Wolf.
The same athlete noticed the storm on social media and acknowledged that he was compared to Leonardo Di Caprio since childhood.
"I personally don't see much similarity except the beard," Breedy tells the Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome ass, so I take it as a compliment."
This year, even more popularity will undoubtedly be one of the most popular pairings of the London 2012 Olympic Games: the striking similarity between British telecaster Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian easy-going Aliy Mustafina, thanks to her large, expressive eyes, is compared to the Cuban-born American singer Gloria Estefan.
When it comes to swimming, South African swimmer Kamerons van der Burgs has been compared to the star Metju Morrison for several years.
Changes: this user noticed that Nathan is a <0x60>sports version<0x60> of the movie "Inception" actor.
Similarly, the old counterparts are tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similar eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist, swimmer Yulia Efimova and actress Annalina Makkorda can boast not only of sun-burned skin and blonde hair. Meanwhile, fans believe that the athletic US athlete Nathan Adrians resembles Joseph Gordon Levitt.
Careful women: The football star (left) Houpai Solo and the actress of the series "Dexters" Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face shape and eyes.
Not one: some Twitter user was pleasantly surprised to find out that others also see this similarity
Theories: this user thinks that there may be a reason why the two look so similar
A Twitter user recently announced with genuine pleasure that "the rest of the internet users agree that Houpa Solo and Jennifer Karpentere actually look the same."
The American football star and actress of the series "Deksters" really have a very similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons apply to Keri Volsh Jenings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linnija. Also, the recipient of the gold medal, the light-hearted Gabi Duglas, boasts a beautiful, wide smile that resembles the "Bring On It" smile.
The CBC Olympic commentator regrets his comment that the Chinese swimmer being 'will end up like a pig'.
Bairona Makdonalda's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanha's finish in fourth place at the 4x200 m freestyle relay for women, caused a fever in CBC viewers.
Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologise for one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "slided out of the race that he had forgotten himself" and "will end up like a pig".
Commenter Baron Makdonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when the 4x200 m freestyle relay for women at the end of the final presented their personal opinion.
Macdonald, who was included in the CBC comment team to give comments on life, said: "That little fourteen-year-old from China can't keep up with it."
"She was too lazy, she slipped out of the race, she just fainted and ended up like a pig."
Thank you very much!
The result of 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana in the second stage was 1:57.79, it is 1.61 seconds slower than the result of the Canadian Teilores Ruckas, allowing the Canadians to reach China.
The audience across Canada reacted immediately on the Internet, because they were shocked to hear such tone and expressions.
Emets Makfarlain tweeted: “Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China “ends up like a pig”???.
The idiot did not realize that they were still in a straight line.
Ai Yanha from China 4x200m freestyle final women were called "a small fourteen-year-old from China who is not with us."
Criticism of Bairon Macdonald quickly took effect, as many asked for explanations.
Twitter users couldn’t believe hearing the insensitive comments of Bairon Macdonald.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote: "Oho, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and because of you, we all sound like racists.
Soon afterwards, Scott Russell, who was at the time leading the CBC's live broadcast, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying: "We're sorry that the comment about the swimming result was played in the live theatre."
It was an unsuccessful choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded to Twitter’s comment.
A colleague of McDonald’s, Scott Russell, had to apologize in his place.
CBC then apologized to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald’s comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and a statement.
We are very sorry that such comments were expressed and that they came to the direct ether.
Yesterday, we immediately reacted and apologized to all viewers and followers of the live stream on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that the comments of the Baron were expressed on the performance of the swimmer and not addressed to her personally.
However, in any case, they were unprofessional and unsuccessfully chosen expressions and the very unfortunate events of the Barons.
On Thursday afternoon, Makdonalds personally apologized at the live show and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
At the CBC Olympic Games, he said: "I would like to take a moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday after the women's freestyle competition."
I am talking about the performance of the swimmer, not him personally.
It’s hard to say that I didn’t mean to show disrespect and I’m really sorry that it happened.
Primark customers are shocked by a woman who unkindly keeps her underwear in the middle of the store.
Buyers felt uncomfortable when a woman began to dress up to hold a panty in the middle of the store.
As the situation worsened even more, she kept them to make sure they belonged to her and then pulled them off, putting the panties back in the store shelf.
She went on to look for clothes at the Folkestone Bouverie Place shopping mall and held four more panties.
Primark store Bouverie Place in the shopping center in Folkestone – a place where this woman used to hold underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
At the same time, the store also housed the mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who says that an unknown woman, after wearing underwear, pulled her clothes and left the store, without buying anything.
She points out that people couldn’t believe their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she picked up her underpants from the shelf, pulled her panties and trousers and then measured them on the spot.
She didn’t even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she just kept them in place.
Everyone watched her pull the panties and apparently the woman didn’t like them, because she just put them back on the shelf.
She weighed three more panties until she decided that she didn’t like any of them and left the store.
It was not considered that she would be worried that someone would look or think of a person who would buy the clothes she was wearing.
The 33-year-old cousin of Davidson, from Kent, says: "It's a good idea that someone will buy clothes that have been taken care of by another person and which have not been washed afterwards."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
She adds: "I assume that the store staff took these clothes off the store shelves after she left the store - which is also acceptable."
I can’t imagine that I could buy a new underwear and find out that another woman has put them on hold and then they haven’t been washed.
The Primark representative indicated that Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
These clothes are removed from the shelves of the store.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect yourself at close range from attackers with a rifle, we spoke with the Krav Maga Grandmaster from New York's Ron Mizraki.
Regardless of whether you attack from the front or the back, this video shows you how to protect yourself and get the upper hand over the attacker.
Mizraki indicates if the attacker attacks from the back, then first it is necessary to turn to see the attacker clearly and avoid the trajectory of the shot.
Then the weapon should be struck between its front arm and shoulder and make a stab in the face of the opponent with its free elbow.
Then follow the hit with a road through the circle and as long as the assailant is in pain, he must take off the weapon, face the weapon with the sword and step back, continuing to turn the weapon against him.
If the attacker approaches from the front, the situation is similar - to avoid the trajectory of the shot, to hit the gun and to dislodge it so that the villain can not scream.
At the same time, the pressure on the weapon should be exerted and the hit of the opponent on the chest and finally the weapon should be removed from him and he should step back and continue to focus on him.
Does it sound complicated?
Watch the video to see how exactly Mizraki does it.
But remember, if you are not the master of Krav Maga, then it is safer to give your money back to the thief.
The Vandal family demolishes the social home of Salta<0xC5><0xA1>a Kornvola and is placed on the street.
The Vandal family has been laid off from their place of residence for terrorizing the neighbors, causing damage to the social home of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000.
Tanja Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilkoks immediately left the property in Salta<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x97> Kornvola, because of several complaints about them.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, the shocked representatives of the housing service found that the property had been completely demolished.
There were holes in the floor and walls, there were scattered debris everywhere, and the walls were covered with graphite.
The family is now detached from the property and is likely to live in a private property.
Donna Makevoja, the manager of the Kornvola Housekeeping Service, says that there are concerns that it will not be possible to restore the house.
She says that the people who lived here have been extremely difficult and she believes that people cannot live in it.
In this case, a number of factors need to be assessed, as this property will not have a good reputation in Cornwall in the future.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who periodically stayed in the property and the police say that their terror is manifested as violence, walking down the street with baseball bats, intimidation of local residents, drug use, drug sales and loud banging and barking.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was owned, was fined for anti-social behaviour in June.
Several rooms of the demolished house have found estimated waste.
In the house, where previously possible drugs are traded, there are also several floor boards leaking.
The neighbors say that they regularly bumped into the street and constantly being called the police.
The Kornvola Housewives service forced them out of the property when they had been given 11 weeks to get out of the house voluntarily.
The missing neighbors were very happy about the lie, because their lives had been an absolute hell.
One said, "They didn't care about other residents."
We lived next to them for 20 years, it has always been crazy.
I can't believe how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't wait this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we did not experience it!
Now that they are finally gone, here will be wonderful.
Adams Fitzpatrick, who is the head of the neighborhood defense of the Kornvola Homeschool Service, said the family did not cooperate with the local security authorities.
The family lived here for 20 years and here is regularly called the police.
In the growing garden of the house, various old and unused items were found.
He also said: "It is very regrettable that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behavior, because leaving the house is always the last step considered by the Kornvola Housekeeping Service."
This was a very difficult case, because their behavior was extreme and the neighbors were very hard to monitor in their behavior.
I appreciate the work that my entire team, the Devon and Cornwall Police and the community members, who have been brave and have cooperated with us in providing the necessary information, have contributed to this case.
I hope that this event will facilitate the lives of the neighbours and show that anti-social behaviour is not acceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons here lived in different periods of time, but all were about 20 years old.
A dirty mattress that remained on the floor in one of the rooms after laying out.
The staff of the service will now have to clean up the pile of waste left at home.
In 2014, the police house scratched and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, accessories and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeldone was only found guilty of possession of Class B drugs for the purpose of distributing them.
She claimed that the money was intended for a memorial to her son, Li Sheldon, who was killed in a car accident in 2013.
After laying it out, it became known that they are currently renting some private property in Plymouth.
On many walls of the house were engraved graffiti.
The police say that they will continue to expose tenants who violate their leases.
The police representative of Devon and Cornwall, An<0xC5><0xBE>ela Krova, points out that this layoff is an unequivocal warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, "This is a warning to those who think they can behave as they please and there will be no consequences."
Devona and Kronvola police have no criminal and anti-social behaviour and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
Willingness to spend can give a boost to the economy.

Canoeing has banned burkini swimsuits on beaches.
The mayor of Cannes, a resort town in the south of France, has banned the wearing of burkini swimsuits on the city’s beaches, which almost completely covers the body of a woman and is very reminiscent of a hydro suit, local officials said on Thursday.
Kannu Mayor David Linar has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good customs and secularism" as the basic principle of the French Republic.
"The beach suit, which clearly shows religious affiliation at a time when France and the places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks, can create a risk of a disruption of public order (sweeping, collisions, etc.) that needs to be avoided," he said.
"We are not talking about a ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about foreign clothing, which is related to the confidence in the terrorist movements that are at war with us," said the head of municipal utilities, Tjeri Miguls.
He added that burkini swimsuits on Kannu beaches have not been seen since 28 July, when the right-wing member of the central party "Republicans" Lin<0xC4><0x81>rs signed this order and it came into force.
This week, the water park in the city of Marseilles has cancelled a planned private event for Muslim women, who would be dressed in burkini swimsuits, because the dryness of such events was felt by politicians from both the right and the left.
In France, it is prohibited to wear the headscarves of Muslim women wearing face coverings, but no religious symbols or appropriate clothing are prohibited.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack in the nearby resort city of Nica, which was carried out by the Islamic State group.
On 26 July, two attackers, who had sworn allegiance to the "Islamic State", brutally silenced priests in a church in the northwest of France.

This year too, as in other years, the main task of the company is to continue to increase both turnover and profit.

The festival "Kub<0xC4><0x81>na" has started in Lucavsala.
On Thursday, August 11th, in the evening of Lucavsala was given the start of one of the last festivals of this summer - there will be "Kub<0xC4><0x81>na" until Sunday night.
On the first night of the meeting, groups such as "Enter Shikari" from the UK, which was expected last night, but from the program without losing, American banks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
Also in the next days of the festival, there are notable words in the program - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", the bulwark of the punk legend "Ramones", Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg, "Brutto&Lyapis" with the Belarusian populism, the leader of the Serbian populism
This is the second year that the festival "Kubana" takes place in Latvia.
In the wake of this severe financial failure and huge losses, but the organizers of the parade did not abstain from repeated attempts - they added a long sign to the name, the program also included a group of Latvians (Friday evening 19:15 on the stage) on the stairs "All"
Whether these efforts are justified, it is still too early to judge, because the festival has only fallen, but, as the first night observed "Delfi Entertainment", at least for the time being huge efforts of people to attract have not been successful and the number of visitors was similar to the previous one.

The President who remained in the shadow: Gustav Zemgall - 145.
On Friday, August 12, 145 years have passed since the birth of the second President of Latvia, Gustavs Zemgalls.
Zemgals proclaimed the state of Latvia, but has remained largely described by the first Latvian president J<0xC4><0x81>nis <0xC4><0x8C>akste and the last president of the pre-war period, Kar<0xC4><0x81>lis Ulmans.
None of our fellow citizens has defended democracy and the rule of law as much as Zemgal, written by Arnold Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> in the book dedicated to Gustav Zemgal ten years ago.
In a conversation with the portal "Delfi" Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> stresses that Zemgals is one of the rare high-ranking politicians who has had a sense of humor.
The rest are so rigid, always very correct.
He taught not to be, today it could be similar to what Raymond Véjonis is.
"He was the one who is close to the people," says Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
Today’s politicians know history badly, they refer to Carly Ulmani as a good leader, but rarely does anyone know how ungrateful he was.
The only person in the government who did not have a voice was General Balodis.
Even if in pictures he is kind and funny, by nature he was hysterical.
“The country with its sense of humor and democracy leaves a direct impression of the opposite,” says Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
Professor of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia Aivars Stranga in a conversation with "Delfi" agrees to the assessment of Auzin as a peaceful and determined citizen of Zemgal.
He also notes that Zemgals has distinguished himself with respect to minorities, regularly invited Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"At that time, it was not an ordinary act, after the presidency of the Netherlands, Albert Kviesis took over this tradition," the historian says.
He was such a quiet and focused man who had long had to talk about becoming president.
He didn’t do it himself, he just didn’t make a name for himself.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know the French language, but felt that the President should definitely understand it.
"During the presidency, the foundations of the French language were learned," explains Stranga.
He was not allowed to run again, he really did not like his high office at all.
In any case, he is a very respectable person in the history of Latvia, already before entering the presidential palace he was in a serious position - he was a very demanding notary.
Also, Zemgals ran the famous Zemgala kas on Suvorova Street 3, where there was a society of stockholders and depositors, practically in the negotiations of the government of the Latvian state.
He was always progressive-minded.
He was not a great admirer of Ulman, but neither did he publicly respond.
“In private negotiations, it has sometimes been said that Ulman’s actions are not really sympathetic to him,” Stranga said.
There lived a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of illegality or corruption.
How does Zemgal remember these days?
Unfortunately, for the most part he is associated only with some street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, his views were central.
“There were no major upheavals during his time, that is, he could be associated with a truly stable presidency,” Stranga summarizes.
During the presidency of Gustav Zemgala, from 1927 to 1930, there was also a visit of the Latvian state to Sweden, which during that time indirectly meant for Latvia to be fully recognized in the neighbouring country and to be part of the family of the democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgals arrived in Stockholm on a state visit.
The visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but died in January 1939.
Just ways to help the child cope with angry shocks.
I often come into contact with the fact that the appearance of a child's anger, nausea, or nausea is considered by parents to be something wrong and abnormal.
When the child openly expresses his anger - we do not know how to react, "Econet" indicates psychologist Yekaterina Kesa.
The specialist encourages a small conversation about these natural and human feelings - anger and envy, which are periodically experienced by everyone.
Aggression - it is already a physical action that is directed against another person, and it usually occurs when we feel angry.
When we, as adults, are angry, upset - we usually know what is going on with us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and envy within ourselves: express, squeeze, hide, keep to ourselves, tell about it to our friends or other close friends, we can in anger to blow up the sofa, smoke cigarettes (it's not the best way to do it, throw in the anger)
We do not turn our aggression against others, because we know different other ways of dealing with these emotions.
When children come to them in anger, they do not understand what is happening to them, how to name them and how to live with them.
They can say, "Don't go!", "You're a fool", "Bad mom", "I don't care about you", "I'm not watching with you" - and very rarely when they can say, "I'm angry with you".
Children live in a literal sense, they are completely located right here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and truly expressing their feelings, and often also are in the grip of different emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prohibit the child from showing feelings, including anger, do not regret it and do not think about it, but on the contrary - help the child.
Is it necessary to pause in a relationship?
A long day of work, where everything has certainly not happened as you would like, or simply a bad mood - there are so many reasons why you would like to for a moment, a day or even longer to "unplug" from the whole world.
Is it possible to impress the relationship for a moment and to smile a little?
Is it, however, proof that each of the partners is on their own path?
They share their views at different ages.
John (23) is short and hearty: "In my view, if you need a break in a relationship, then you are not with a real person."
Meanwhile, Eduards (30) has discovered a scheme that may possibly help someone.
If you feel that a partner begins to fall on your nerves for every little detail, then certainly - this is the right time when you should explore other hunting grounds to understand if you miss him, or especially about him not thinking about him or even don't even bother to see him anymore.
So the answer is - yes, holding a break can help save time and understand how important the other side is to you.
Caspar (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, it is necessary to keep a break from each other on a daily basis, because if you spend time with people 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then the dispute is inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every detail that the other is doing, and it starts to fall on your nerves.
People start to get angry with each other, especially if you don’t even have anything to say about, except what you’ve been doing all day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I have not been in a relationship for more than a couple of months.
If you think for a moment that somewhere else or with others is better - then why has this woman you are with deserved someone who can think that you are not good enough and behind the mountains there are fields of paradise?
Thinking is already a small deception.
I don't, then I don't.
"I have, so I'm a little bit condemning those who don't." says Edmunds (46).
I think it’s the opposite of what you say.
I think everyone needs a moment for the room.
You can’t look at each other every moment, all the time, from morning to evening, and brag about unrequited love.
Attopies!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everyone has their own time.
Of course, even a friend or wife, however, if both can maintain their balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live up to the edge of the cap.
That and only that.
Marti<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> (27) says: "It is difficult to say - whether you need it or not, whether you can or cannot take a break from it, but one thing is clear - that the proposer does not have something in a relationship until the end, something is missing."
If this issue appears, then it should be calculated that there will be some changes in the near future - on the right or the wrong side, it depends on the same.
I mean, while you're still young and crazy, while you know you need something all the time, but when everything is still serious and the relationship goes into a completely different phase, then there can be no talk about rest.
You decide to spend the rest of your life together!
“If you can’t stand each other’s company now and need a shelter once in a while, then what will happen when you become a pensioner who comments on how long-term cats bite or argue about which day the garden should be better cared for,” explains Kristaps (19).

With his passionate and passionate personality, Rosentals first stimulated the interest of the Latvian people in the visual arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain unforgettable for all time," wrote Roman Suta, the Latvian master of painting.
Also in 2016, in the year of opening a large retrospective exhibition of the old master at the restored Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear - Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on August 12, but from August 13 it is available to visitors and will be open until October 30.
The National Museum of Art of Latvia, with a wide retrospective in the newly opened Grand Exhibition Hall, is the year of the painter Jani Rozent<0xC4><0x81>lu (1866-1916), whose one hundred and fiftyth birthday is included on the international calendar of UNESCO's anniversary.
The retrospective exhibition, which examines more than 150 works, is one of the central events of the annual programme of Jan Rosenthal.
The selection of works of art is largely made up of a collection of Latvian National Museum of Art, which clearly represents the main stages and genres of the creative activity of the classic, stylistic change and the variety of techniques.
In addition, the exhibits from the Akseli Gallena-Kallela Museum, the Museum of Literature and Music, the Liepaja Museum, the Tucum Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland were used.
The atmosphere of the mill of centuries revives the presence of photographs, the exhibition’s mobile application reveals the connections of individual works of art with photographs taken by the painter himself with his camera for the purposes of new creation.
At the same time, the Finnish-Latvian Society "Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls-seura", named after the Latvian classic, at the Latvian National Museum of Art offers a small informative travelling exhibition "With a view in Finland, with a heart in Latvia" at the first.
A similar exhibition with content in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened in autumn in the "Virka" gallery in Helsinki.
Mets Leblanks is looking forward to returning to the show "TopGear".
The head of the TV show "TopGear" ("Gazy on the floor!") Mets Leblanks expressed that he was looking forward to returning to the second season of the car show, but admitted that he did not know what to expect in the future.
For now, nothing is officially happening.
"If there is, then I will announce it to the BBC," Leblank revealed in an interview with television critics.
Shame on "Gaze on the floor!" the future arose in July, when Leblanc's Reverend Chris Evans announced that he was leaving the show.
After leaving, Evans acknowledged that Leblank and "Gaze on the floor!" are "as created for each other".
The star of Evans' former series "Friends" ("Friends") is described as a "real and serious man", thus raising fears that the friendship between the two had deteriorated during filming.
When Leblankm asked what he liked most about the show, he replied that the trip to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The BBC reported that the show is temporarily not going to replace Evans in the new 24th season.
Kalvi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>: Meldonia could already be removed from the list of banned substances by athletes this year.
It is expected that the meldonium contained in the drug Mildronates produced in Latvia could be excluded from the list of banned substances for athletes already this year, said Kavar, director of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, in the LNT broadcast on Friday morning 900 seconds.
He said he would go to Canada in September to discuss the melding issue with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The scientist expressed hope that Mildronate will be removed from the "black list" already this year.
Two cyclists were taken to the hospital in Sigulda after a collision.
In Sigulda, on Swiss Street, two cyclists met, receiving various traumas, the State Police said.
The accident involved men born in 1987 and 1990, both of whom were taken to a medical institution.
A hard cyclist also falls in Koknese.
In 1989, a man was born on the street of 1905, and brought to the care of doctors.
In the village of Dobeles, in the parish of Naud<0xC4><0xAB>tes, in 1989, a motorcyclist was born to try to avoid a dog that has fallen on the road and walks.
He's in the hospital, too.
On Sunday, 71 road traffic accidents were registered in Latvia, in which 16 people were injured.
Sometimes it will rain and it will get colder.
Also on Friday in Latvia some short-term rain is expected and will become even cooler, the agency LETA learned in the center of the Latvian Environment, Geology and Meteorology.
It is possible for places to snore.
According to forecasts, rain is mostly expected in Kurzem and the north of Vidzeme.
The maximum air temperature will only be +16, +19 degrees.
The day in Riga passes without precipitation and mostly shines in the sun.
However, the air will not be warmer than +18 degrees.
U.S. model business lags behind in his interpretation of the perversely distorted gloss of the photo shoot and the horror film’s impatience.
Essentially, it is a very provocative, balancing work on the vulgarity of refinement and banal vulgarity, in which the lines between European art house films and the territory of the Hollywood genre are difficult to draw.
The film with Vigo Mortensen focuses on the question of whether parents’ conceptually chosen life models (ecologicalism, vegetarianism, alternativeism and avoidance of consumer society stupidity and values) bring blessings or destructiveness to their children.
The idealist father of six children after the death of his wife is confronted with questions about the correctness of the choices and the true values.
This year, Mets Ross has won the Cannes Film Festival Award for the direction of a moving, vivacious film.
Of course, the shark does this only as an attack on beautiful swords - in Jokl<0xC4><0xAB>s it was a swimmer, in this case - a brave surfer, which is attributed to Bleika Laivlija.
The work demanded of her fundamental heroism.
This survival solo number can be compared to the James Franko role-playing demonstration in the 127-hour film and the Raien Reinolds game in the film Abrakts <0xC3><0xA4>s.
Perhaps the blame also lies with the main character of the artist Mila Kunis, whose transformations from a model mother to a creative survivor and a family value reminder seem only to be completely lost in the imagination of Hollywood screenwriters.
The Islamic State has captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
A group of Islamic State fighters, fleeing from Menbija, in Syria's Aleppo province, looted about 2,000 civilians used as a living shield, the U.S.-backed Kurdish and Arab alliance and observers said on Friday.
"We did not shoot at them because they, fleeing to Jerabulus, took with them civilians," said a spokesman for the Kurdish Menbija Military Council.
After two months of Kurdish-led clashes, the Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, said Friday that Menbija had been liberated from the jihadists.
The Islamic State of Menbizu took over in 2014.
QSD had already expelled most of the fighters of the "Islamic State" from Menbija last week, but some persisted and demonstrated fierce resistance.
However, on Friday, they left the city, taking the hostages with them.
The Islamists go to Jerabulus, which is near the Turkish border.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a London-based Syrian activist organisation, also reported that the Islamic State had kidnapped around 2,000 people.
The SOHR reported that the Islamists had hijacked the vehicles of the city’s residents, forced people to fall into them, and then brought them to Jerabulus.
Islamic State fighters have also carried out mass kidnappings in the past.
In January, Islamists looted the territory of Deir ez-Zora province in eastern Syria, killing more than 400 civilians, including women and children.
Later, about 270 of the Ghusteks were liberated by Islamists.
It is not known how many Islamic State fighters fled from Menbijah.
A spokesman for the Kurdish Military Council of Menbija reported that QSD managed to rescue 2,500 people who were held hostage by Islamists in Menbija.
The information gathered by SOHR shows that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, were killed in the battle for the life of Menbi<0xC5><0xBE>.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists were killed.
Kol<0xC4><0xAB>gova refuses to run for the position of head of the VID.
Inga Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova, head of the State Environmental Service, decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), LETA informed the agency in the Ministry of Finance.
Kol<0xC4><0xAB>gova points out that the discussion of her candidacy has increased the conflict between the ruling coalition parties.
It seems that the real reasons for the discussions are related to the visible but more often invisible interests of politicians and they have nothing to do with the assessment of my professional abilities.
"It's not acceptable to me either," stresses the former VID head of state.
In the event that her candidacy would be approved by the Government, it would be clear that this would not be a convincing vote and would not allow the necessary changes to be fully worked and implemented by the VID, feeling the support of the Government as a whole.
Without it, full-fledged work would not be possible, Kol<0xC4><0xBC>egov concludes.
"Most of the time I have publicly stressed that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment my entire candidacy process is overly politicized," explains the official.
"Thanks for the trust and support shown to me, it is an experience that I value as a benefit," writes Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova in the submission to Reizniece-Ozolai.
The unity showed on Wednesday that during the meeting with Kol<0xC4><0xBC>egov there were "substantial contradictions" between the candidate's explanations and the information available in the public registers on the cost of the Pallogs dividends, as the publicly available decisions of the Pallogs participants' meetings do not share profits.
Currently, the duties of the head of the VID are carried out by Deputy Director-General Dace Pel<0xC4><0x97>ka.
In the left, the police are involved in the rescue of two unsupervised children, informs the State Police Department of the Latgale region.
Notice of unattended sleds with infants received on Friday at around 7 p.m.
They found themselves in a building in Lebanon near the former store.
The two little girls were immediately handed over to the doctors for help.
Also, a bag with documents and a mobile phone was left on the wheels.
In less than half an hour, law enforcement found out the possible location of the parents of the children and went there.
When a woman arrives at the house of a civilian, police officers found out that the woman is sleeping because she is in a strong alcohol habit.
On the evening of the previous day, in 1992, a woman who was born, was invited to a friend’s house, where she had taken alcohol.
As soon as she went home after a joint planting, the woman decided to leave the children at the store under unspecified circumstances.
The police immediately informed the children's court, which will also decide on the future fate of the child.
Riga is free to introduce all the recommendations of the VK regarding the project of the Russian island.
The Riga Free Board has introduced all of the five recommendations of the State Control (VK) regarding the development of the project Infrastructure for the transfer of port activities on the Russian island from the implementation of the city center, the portal Diena.lv informed the company.
The approval of the project is planned at the nearest meeting of the Riga Free Board.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the opinion of the VK, in preparation of the necessary documentation for the implementation of the recommendations, the Management Board of Riga Bryvostas was also guided by the draft conclusions and recommendations of the draft and the operational audit carried out by the international auditor Deloitte Riga.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the UK today.
Despite the fact that the Free Government of Riga does not agree with the opinion prepared by the UK on the effectiveness of the implementation of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the funding provider - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all the planned construction works within the project have been completed in full within the specified deadlines and the planned scope.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the VK and also to the sponsors that the main goal of the freedom is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the VK regarding project management and supervision issues," said the Russian project manager.
The long-term action plan for the control and monitoring of the achievement of the project objective was complemented by the main planned actions of the parties involved and the necessary decision-making deadlines, meetings and regular reporting definitions and drafts of the draft instruments,
The approved action plan for the achievement of the project objective until 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the VK, is complemented by implementation monitoring activities, thus strengthening the control of the deadlines for the activities of the other parties involved in the implementation of the project by the Riga Free Party.
In order to improve project management and reduce potential risks, a project management plan has been re-designed, defining project management areas and specifying the developed documents that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
To increase the project capacity, a project management framework has been developed, which reflects the structure, qualifications and functions of the planned project management team.
In order to improve the communication of the Riga Free Management with the parties involved in the project, a communication plan of the parties involved in the project has been developed, which in addition to the parties specified in the project action plan, defines the principles of communication of the parties involved in the successful completion of the project, exchange of information and exchange of information.
In order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, the need for the conclusion or initiation of a service contract and the rule of law will need to be further elaborated.
Within the framework of the project, the Russian island has built a world-standard port infrastructure - four new deep-water docks, a railway entrance, as well as engineering communications.
The co-financed construction of the Cohesion Fund has been completed and put into operation at the end of the year already, resulting in a financial savings of EUR 10.6 million.
Because of the threat, security at airports in Slovakia has been strengthened.
After receiving non-specific threats, Slovakia stepped up security measures at several airports on Friday, the Ministry of the Interior said.
"Given the threats, we have stepped up security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Ko<0xC5><0xA1>ice," the Slovak Interior Ministry's press representative told AFP on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analysing the information we have received," he added.
The informal European Union (EU) summit will take place in the Slovak capital on 16 September, with the exception of the United Kingdom.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of Britain's Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia is the EU's presidency by January.
German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of victims at the Communist Yard in the former Eastern part of the country could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the actual number of victims remain unresolved.
According to data released on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, 1841 people who tried to get out of control were trapped by the Communist Powers of the West during the period between 1945 and 1989.
The museum has been investigating border-related deaths for many years and is adjusting the number of victims from time to time.
This year, 11 more deaths were added to the list, including one of the victims, including a six-year-old boy who died trying to reach his family in West Germany through then-Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are also Soviet army deserters.
“The extent of the ultimate damage done by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented,” admits Alexander Hildebrante, director of the museum.
"Our task is to ensure that the cape of those who were killed trying to escape from a communist-controlled country is maintained and not lost," Hildebrantes said in a statement.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The figure of 1841 is inconclusive," says Johens St<0xC3><0xA4>ts, an expert in the history of the East German University of Berlin, in an interview with the newspaper S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutsche Zeitung.
He, along with other researchers at the Free University of Berlin, is currently reviewing possible suspected deaths at the border, and so far they have managed to confirm only 260 cases.
In the past, researchers have estimated that 138 people were killed by the Communists at the Berlin Wall alone.
Taking into account those people who have died trying to escape the Baltic Sea or reach the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, according to the State, the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, it does not matter much less than in 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all cases of suicide of the Eastern Border Guards, regardless of whether they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths that are not related to direct violence.
"If seniors between 70 and 80 years of age after colliding with border control peace from the heart attack", it should have the consequences of these "blind border", considers Hildebrante.
However, the Charter is convinced that a distinction must be made between the old people who may have died as a result of their experience of circumvention and those whose death was caused by a long wait on the hot bus at the border.
Regardless of the number of its victims, it is not easy, since the Communist Powers of the East did not collect such statistics, and researchers should select documents in the various scattered archives, states the Statute.
However, the Stata Group has recently acquired new documents and could therefore come up with an estimate of the number of new victims in the near future.
The President of the LPF, Pone, visited Rio with the accreditation of the coach; this is a surprise.
In recent days, the president of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF), Kaspars Pone Riode<0xC5><0xBE>aneiro, has come with the accreditation of the coach, however, the feeling itself surprised about it.
On Wednesday, a wide rift was caused by the statements of Olympic swimmer Alyona Ribakova’s coach, German Jakubovska, who revealed that at the last minute Riode<0xC5><0xBE>aneiro decided to go to Pone while the coach is at home.
Initially, swimmers Aliona Ribakova and Uvis Kalni<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, trainers Jakubovskis and Deivs Kolinss, as well as Federation President Pone were approved on the list of drivers.
The Latvian Swimming Federation applied for five participants for the Olympic Games, and even before the launch, Aldon Vrub<0xC4><0xBC>evskis claimed that Germans will be and he is looking for tickets.
"However, obviously for objective reasons he was not," Pone said, expressing the opinion that this did not affect Ribakov's results.
At the request of the federation, the coach of Uvja undertook to help her.
Mr Pone, who is himself a member of the LOK Executive Committee, probably criticized the activities of the LOK by bringing the blame on the Olympic sports watchdog organization.
In my view, it is unethical for the LOK Executive Committee to approve five persons and not to remove any of them.
"I don't know why exactly the Swimming Federation didn't have enough room," Pone said, noting that the work of the Federation and its presidents has not been evaluated in society, noting that the presidents of the Federation do not receive salaries.
Mr. Pone also criticized Mr. Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he appealed to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and urged Latvia not to participate in the sport.
Pone could not tell why he was with the coach's accreditation at the Olympic Games, which probably had to be approached by Jakubovski.
"I was nominated as the president of the federation ("team leader"), but for unknown reasons I received the accreditation of the coach and now I don't go anywhere inside."
The situation has changed every day, the number of accreditations available has changed.
Until the last moment, I think Germans will be, because I did not have any other information.
According to the information available to the agency LETA, a few days before the start of Ribakov, she had a conversation face-to-face with Poni and after her swimmer was with the ears of the eyes, however, the President of the LPF himself showed that it was a daily conversation with the desire to start the sport.
Mr. recalled that the LPF supervised five types of sports that are in the Olympic programme, and four of them are also training for children in Latvia.
The President of the Federation has shown that in Latvia, cutting issues are also very important, and also about such programmes he spoke about, Riode<0xC5><0xBE>aneiro being already almost two weeks old.
He celebrated the work of the Federation and stated that in 2018 the World Cup phase could be solved in Latvia.
Location Riode<0xC5><0xBE>aneiro is not my vacation, I work here, spend my time and try to implement four-year programs.
You will have 600,000 lasagna babies in your house.
During AS Latvenergo’s fish remediation programme this week, salmon and seal pups are introduced in Daugava near Mangalsala, and this year it is planned to introduce more than 600,000 annual salmon and seal pups, which were bred by the scientific institute Biormes Doormes and the scientific institute Douja.
LETA informed Latvenergo that the introduction of fish will continue in the coming months, with a total of 6 300 000 different species of small fish and crustaceans being introduced in the Daugava basin each year.
In the spring and early summer of 2016 will be released the drops of lids and needles, in June - sigas, in July - summer drops, in August and September - sandstones and vimbas.
Maris Kunickis, Latvenergo’s production director, said that environmental concerns are one of the cornerstones of Latvenergo’s sustainable development.
"In the measures for the protection and reproduction of fish resources, all activities are directed towards environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, both by raising and introducing fish in the Daugava basin and by carrying out other activities in Ku<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k<0xC4><0xB1>",
This year, more than 600,000 single-year-old salmon and oysters will be introduced to Daugava’s soil.
Already for the second year, the babies of fish are marked before insertion by cutting fat.
Today’s cargo contains 25 000 salmon babies with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Every year, in the composition of scientifically-based species and in numerical quantities in Daugava and its pool of water, the introduction of small fish and crustaceans takes place.
The multiplication of fish resources in Daugava and its basin in the watersheds shall be carried out by Bior in accordance with the regulatory acts, on the basis of an expert opinion on the loss of fish resources as a result of Latvenergo's economic activities, and by providing a conclusion on the amount of compensatory resources available.
On the other hand, on the basis of that expertise, the National Environmental Service shall decide on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual amount of the Latvian compensation in the fisheries recovery programme shall be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016 Latvenergo, in cooperation with the company "We fish", places 400 artificial fish moorings in Daugava near Kaibala and Ik<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0xB7>iles.
Co-operation with the company in promoting natural spawning of fish is further supported by Latvenergo within the framework of the Fish Resource Recovery Programme.
The placement of artificial cod ponds in a reservoir is an important measure that promotes the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugava.
The festival "Sansussi Concert Hall" is a rural courtyard, forest, cherry.
You can sit in the tent, eat like a restaurant, walk around and listen to the investigated chamber music, enjoying the quiet peace of nature, - such a combination offers an alternative chamber music festival in Sansus, which invites you to the Akn<0xC4><0xAB>ste district for the third summer.
The festival will take place in Sus<0xC4><0x93>jas - a no longer existing village - in the former parish yard, next to the forests and groves.
In three days - from 12 to 14 August - on five stages can combine the carefree enjoyment of nature and the exquisite taste of academic music.
Here the music meets the theatre and the contemporary circus, performance and installation.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest releases, find new listeners in a free and open environment without the rigidity of concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but to smile in the face and lightness in the legs only a few minutes.
"Please do not look for the program because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance so that people do not go to one specific event or artist, because the true taste in Sansus can only be captured by spending all three days in it," says the initiator and owner of the festival.
The doors of the festival are open on Fridays at 5 p.m. and the first concert is at 7 p.m.
Of course, there will be on-site software with all the information.
For those who need to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, because it is the most crowded - from 9.00 a.m. until the next morning.
"The words of the artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv", says Armands Sili<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
In the beautiful bouquet of artists there are, for example, violinist Eva Binder, cellist Krist<0xC4><0xAB>ne Blaufin<0xC4><0x97>, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, trumpeter J<0xC4><0x81>nis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zar<0xC4><0xAB><0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, quartets Quadra and RIX, and even Estonian choir acro.
New works have also been specially made for the festival.
In the exhibition for children "Kukainis", composed by O<0xC4><0xBC>esja Kozlovska and J<0xC4><0x93>kabs N<0xC4><0xAB>manis on the basis of the reasons for the Overvaluation of Kafka, together with Armand Sili<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, musicians and actors will participate in the entomologist (Kukain researcher) U<0xC4><0xAB>s Piter<0xC4><0x81>ns.
Oskars Herli<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> has performed the first Strigo quartet, while Anna <0xC4><0xB6>irse - Wooden opera, a performanceist whose main characters are directed by Andra Kalnozola with the video projections of Katrin Neiburg and Andra Egli<0xC5><0xA1>'s scenography will be the trees in three small squares.
While dancing in the voices of Laimas Ledina, Din<0xC4><0x81>ras Rud<0xC4><0x81>nas and Zigm<0xC4><0x81>ra Gra<0xC5><0xA1>a, they enter into romantic relationships, just as the Swedish naturalist Karl Linnaeus studied the marriage of Kokus (1729).
The Riode<0xC5><0xBE>aneiro Olympic Games today kick off one of the biggest hopes of the Latvian delegation, seven-year-old athlete Laura Ikauniece-Admidi<0xC5><0x86>a.
Ikauniece-Admidi<0xC5><0x86>a at 15.35 a.m. after Latvian time will start the race in the 100 metre barrier intersection, but at 16.50 a.m. in the high jump of the race.
In contrast, already at night on Saturday at 2.35 p.m. will begin the hardening of the ice, while at 4.05 a.m. - 200 meters sprint.
The seven-fight competition will be concluded on Saturday, when the race will take place for a distance jump, a ski jump and an 800-metre race.
Before the Olympic Games, Ikauniece-Admidin, who recently won the bronze in the World Championship, was mentioned as an Olympic Games medal contender.
In May, Latvia set a new national record (6622 points) and won second place in the prestigious seven-match competition in the Austrian city of Gecis.
Ikauniece-Admidini<0xC5><0x86>a also participated in the 2012 London Olympics, when she won the ninth place with a repeat of the Latvian record.
During the last year and a half, the athlete has improved the national record four times.
Today at 16 o’clock the start is also planned for the Latvian judo racer Art<0xC5><0xAB>ram <0xC5><0x9E>ikiforenko, who starts in the weight category over 100 kilograms, first of all ending the fight with Azerbaijani athlete U<0xC5><0x9F>angi Kukauri.
For the Jew, this will be the first Olympic Games in his career.
The LETA agency already reported that on Thursday in the weight category up to 100 kilograms of loss already experienced in its first battle Latvian judo race Jevgenijs Borodavko.
He was awarded the Japanese Hagu Rjunoski, who later won the bronze.
In 2000, Vsevolods Zel<0xC4><0xBC>onijs brought the Olympic bronze medal to Latvia, but in the next four Olympic games, Latvian judists in seven battles together won only one victory, which Borodavko made in London.
At 16.30, Dainis Upelnieks will begin shooting at the Latvian time-qualification competition stand, but the selection will conclude on Saturday.
The winner of the Olympic badge received only on the day on which the official composition of the Latvian delegation was announced, but later he revealed to the agency LETA that it has been quite safe to drive since April.
The athlete came as one of the first Latvian athletes at the site of the Olympic event, trying to make the most of the training opportunities in the event shooting.
At 19.05 p.m., the debutant of the Olympic Games, Ketija Birzule, a 17-year-old Latvian baritone, will be competing for the RS:X class.
After three days or nine trips, Birzule is currently ranked 25th among 26 athletes in the overall ranking.
In contrast, Saturday will be the decisive final drive for medals.
Today, it is finally planned to take part in the competition in the academic airing, where the Latvian representative of Ireland, Sanita Pu<0xC5><0xA1>puri, is to participate.
On Wednesday, the competition was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions.
Pu<0xC5><0xA1>pure at 19.10 will meet the women of the C/D semi-final singles, fighting for 13th place in the Olympics.
On Tuesday, in the quarter-finals, she won fourth place, from the third position, which would allow the fight for the medal to continue, with a 0,65 seconds lag.
Pu<0xC5><0xA1>pure won 13th place in London four years ago, when he also represented Ireland.
Today, the Olympic Games will be divided into 24 sets of medals - archery, athletics, trekking, rowing, diving, trampling, judo, academic airing, shooting, swimming, tennis and weightlifting.

The Senate Republican Party has blocked Garland's approval since he was nominated by President Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Michs Makonnels announced that the next president will be elected to replace the current Supreme Court Justice Antonina Skaliu.
During his conference on Thursday, Reid announced that he was confident that Clinton would choose Garland.
A representative of Reida later indicated that he personally did not talk about this topic with Clinton and they are just speculation.
He praised Garland and stated that the Clinton team would not "swallow the ship" with another choice.
Garlands is the Chief Justice of the U.S. District Court of Appeals for Colombia.
Reid said Republicans who block Garland's nomination are "insurgents" and are acting in the interests of Donald Trump, the Republican Party's presidential candidate.
He also stated that Trump is not suitable for the job of the president.
Treats announces the calender calendars for women and men.
The magazine Treats will collaborate with photographer David Belm<0xC3><0xA8>res to create the 2017 calendar of Pirreli in the style of the 70th century.
In its 2017 NU M<0xC5><0xAB>zu calendar, it is planned to demonstrate new supermodels, not bald celebrities.
At the beginning of this year, Treats magazine president Steve Shaw announced that his erotic art magazine is different from the old-fashioned Playboy, because "Playboy is a men's magazine".
This magazine is for women.
He also seems to be talking about the calendar.
In a press release about the creation of the calendar, Shaw said: "We have to go back to the images of the invincible and classic horror, where women's bodies do not muse, but inspiration from both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project, because it is a great work of art.
Models can send their photos electronically or in person during casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.

Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video review
Scientists claim that Greenland sharks have the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on our planet.
Julius Nilsen, a Haitian researcher, says that the record for survival belongs to a mother who could be 272 to 512 years old and five meters long.
The French court rejected the request to demolish shops in the "Jungle" refugee camp.
The French court has rejected the authorities’ demand to demolish dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the Jungle Camp, home to several thousand refugees.
At this week’s court hearing, the authorities in Kale said that the state should destroy 72 self-developed shops where people in the camp area sell various goods, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdresser services, one per 50 cent (tea)
The Prefect's Office in Kale indicated that these self-developed enterprises must be destroyed because they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitary risks.
The representatives of the humane group explained to the court that these small businesses are essential because the food provided by the government and support groups does not provide the needs of the camp, in which the number of residents continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-developed shops and restaurants often offer free shelters and food to those who need it most.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of the people who set up 72 self-made shops, but it understood the prefect’s concerns.
Justice Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food to people who live in "extremely harsh conditions".
He pointed out that these places are a peaceful meeting place for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of being destroyed is the Jungle Book Kids Camp Cafe, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French language lessons and provides advice on asylum issues to hundreds of unprotected minors without adult supervision.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition for the protection of a children’s cafe.
A letter addressed to the Guardian stated that the liquidation of the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charities "Help for Refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" reported that the number of residents of the "Jungul" camp has increased to 9,000 people, which is the highest figure since the rapid influx of migrants in the summer.
Britain wins a silver rebbie-7 in the fight, when Fiji's national team masterfully beats the gold.
The impressive performance of the British selection in the rebbie-7 series stage ended on Thursday, when in the exciting final match at Deodoro Stadium, the national team of Rio Fiji convincingly defeated them with a score of 43:7.
Fiji demonstrated a masterclass in the management of the ball, the balls play with their feet, support in the game and brutal force in the game, winning gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The crash brought a worthy consolation prize - a silver medal, which was then the third medal of the United Kingdom. The British team can be proud of their success in the first Olympic reggae-7 tournament, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
In the semi-finals of the match, where the Boxing team suffered a defeat with a score of 7:5 in the first half of the day, it may have played for the United Kingdom in the final.
But in any case, the Fiji selection is currently in its best shape to also win the 15 men's team.
While unlikely, however, a known consolation for Britain could be the fact that at least one British has won a gold medal. This is Fiji's selection head coach Bens Raiens - a former English coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting experience for the UK.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of Raiena, they lost all games in the rebbie-7 series stage in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
The bite is painful, but the growth is amazing.
Fiji impressively started the match, displacing the British force's tactics with joy.
Captain Tom Micheal and his teammates were in a collision with several opposing coaches and the World Series champions took the lead with a 5-0 lead when Ossea Colinisau won the first touchdown.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased his weight even further by making a landing in the right wing.
The result of 12:0 and the British team had not even really touched the ball.
Michael’s great power technique did not allow the character Leoni Nakarav to score three points, but it only slightly affected Fiji’s performance.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jasa Veremalu scored in the right corner, strengthening the lead over the UK to 17:0.
After the game over, Nacarava increased his excess weight even more and had more than a minute left until the end of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some of the inactions of the British force and crossed the line by scoring points.
The result was 29:0.
In fact, Fiji was born to play rugby-7, while the British were still only learning.
In fact, it is also true.
The British team made major changes in the half, crossing the Fijian line of players... full four minutes, which after the first half of the standard was good, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team match, got a few more points in the Fijian team's field.
Denam Norton managed to score points for the British team by making a draw in the left corner and reaching a score of 36:7, but the game was already lost, while fans of the South Sea Islanders sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
You can't be surprised by Fiji's happy attitude.
Mata William made Fiji win even sweeter with one more draw at the end of the game.
In the end of the game, Fiji was able to start celebrating, but the British were only able to sit in the grass after the crash.
In the first half of the day, Fiji defeated Japan with a score of 20:5, while the British were ahead of South Africa, where in a very fierce fight the two teams won by a touchdown and the South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half, Kails Brauns led the Boxing team, but in the second half, Dens Norton crossed the line with a brilliant mastery and carried the ball between the poles, giving the British victory.
Markus Watson, the brother of England's 15th-team player Antonia, gave the team a victory and another silver medal at the end of the game.
The coach's battle with cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heteri Staning to win the airing competition.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these races and it already says a lot.
From the first to the last cancer, Helen Glover and Heather Staning’s golden moment played a special role on the Estacio da Lagoa route.
Although there are only two athletes on board, she was accompanied by Robin Williams, who inspired her to win even the second Olympic gold medal in the women's pairing, becoming the first women in British sports history to receive such a feat.
She was unquestionably dominant, because for the 39th time she won an unsurpassed, unprecedented victory.
Both great athletes with a swirling elegance sliding over the surface of the water do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind every winning gold medal is a whole team that works hard for athletes to continuously improve their performance and make the biggest contribution to their success was a coach who did not know 30 months ago whether to live this day, because he had to.
After she said, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can operate and so it happened.
If not, it will spread throughout the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It changes your vision a little bit.
William's cancer was discovered in December 2013.
This trio was pleased that William could start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 inter-season and reduce the duration of the break to a minimum, if he could say so.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulates recovery.
I was in the hospital and I walked 6, 10 and even 15 meters long, although the doctor said that I would take a few steps.
It all started.
The flight itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first idea was immediately about William, who was very worried all morning and spoke more than usual under the impression of excitement.
Staning, who has been serving in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said: "This has been an emotionally difficult week, but it means a lot to me."
It just confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robins have worked.
The three years spent with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin we would not have achieved anything, so thank you so much for him, he is the best coach in the world.
I can’t think of a better workout for my teammates or a better trainer.
Helen Glover and Hetere Staning have not lost in any race in five years.
The pair reaches such a huge speed that a competitor cannot compete with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to arrive, Staning and Glover's dominance was too high.
We felt every moment.
Helen said, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is really important not to lose focus.
We had a good start, but at the same time we did not have high hopes.
On that day we did not intend to throw records, but simply to air well and win the races and we did that too.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
Next month will be the wedding of Glover and TV adventure seeker Steve Ba<0xC5><0xA1>al.
For a moment, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that this was my last race.
It would have been too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I am an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very upset.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

In the office of the head of the VID Kol<0xC4><0xAB>gevu "will go to the last".
According to him, now Prime Minister Marim Kuchinski (Greens and Farmers' Union) and Finance Minister Dani Reizniecei-Ozolai (Greens and Farmers' Union) are already "principally important" for the approval of the candidate for the position of Head of the VID.
Rajevskis believes that both Kuchinski and Reizniecei-Ozolai in this government's approval of the head of the VID is "the first big decision" that can affect him as a politician's future.
If the position of the head of the VID is now changed in the election of the candidate, then it will have a negative impact on the public administration of their images.
The cabinet of ministers next week's agenda includes the question of the transfer of the head of the VVD Kol<0xC4><0xAB>geva to the post of Director-General of the VID, according to the government's agenda.
Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola moved to the position of head of the Kol<0xC3><0xAB>gevu VID after In<0xC4><0x81>ra P<0xC4><0x93>tersone resigned from the office and when the competition for the position of Director-General of the VID ended without result.
In an interview with Latvian Radio on Thursday, 11 August, Dace Pel<0xC4><0x93>k<0xC4><0x81>, the executive director of VID, allowed - if she offered to run for the leadership position, then she could agree.
The Minister for Finance later acknowledged that other candidates for the position of head of the VID are not being considered for the time being.
Raivis Dzintars, head of the Saeima Group of the National Association, also acknowledged that the NA is increasingly supporting the management of Kol<0xC4><0xBC>egovu VID.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit is jeopardised by the inability to form a government.
On 12 July, the European Commission (EC) came up with the opinion that Spain and Portugal did not implement sufficient measures to reduce the level of the budget deficit to 3% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) demanded by the euro area.
The calculations show that despite the austerity measures implemented, the deficit of the Portuguese budget at the end of last year was 4.4% of GDP, while in Spain - 5.1%.
However, the European Commission has decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, at the same time as setting fiscal targets for the foreseeable future.
One of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions on both of these countries, however, is the rise of aeroscepticism in many European Union countries.
The additional sanctions would only increase such a negative mood.
Critics point out that the EC is not consistent in its decisions, initially by agreeing on common rules and then not being able to apply them in life.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Veidmann, pointed out that Europe thus loses confidence in itself, creating in the population the idea that the rules of the European Union are recommending rather than binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have approved the extension of the budgetary deficit adjustment period to Portugal by the end of this year and to Spain by 2018.
The European Commission calls on both countries to review the progress made in the coming months, while noting that Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
The initial forecasts show that Portugal's target could be reached within a set time frame and already this year's budget deficit could be reduced to 2.5% of gross domestic product.
This means that, within the framework of the Stability Programme, the government of this country will have to implement savings measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget with additional attention to the control of the costs of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year's budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% and in 2018 - to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, over the next two years, consolidation measures should amount to 0.5% of GDP each year.
The fact that Spain's political parties have not been able to agree on the establishment of a government for eight months makes it particularly difficult to achieve these goals, and there is an increasing possibility that Spain may come to hold a parliamentary term for the third time in a year.
However, public opinion polls show that the political scene of the third election in the country would not change significantly.
The most popular party is still the People's Party led by the current Prime Minister Mariano Rahoja, whose vote would again be less than 33%.
The popularity of the party "Podemos" or "Together we can" and "Ciudadanos" or "Citizens" has slightly increased only by socialists, while against austerity measures the popularity of the party "Podemos" or "Together we can" or "Ciudadanos" or "Citizens" has slightly decreased.
The People's Party wants to achieve the involvement of Socialists and Citizens in the government this month, otherwise it will not be able to adopt and submit a draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission by mid-October.
As the representative of the parliamentary faction of the People's Party, Rafael Hernando, said, if the creation of a government does not succeed and parliamentary elections will still be held for the third time, Spain will become the whole of Europe's fools.
The cleanliness of the beaches in the sea bay of Riga is critical.
In a five-year survey of the beaches, activists concluded that unfortunately, the number of wastes found each year is increasing, and the majority of visitors to the bathing sites are blamed here.
The most polluted swimming areas are directly in Riga.
In the mind of the capital, explains that swimming pools are held daily, but it is quite difficult to fight against unclean visitors.
In addition, the waste left on the ground during the rainy season can be immersed in water, thus seriously damaging its quality.
With the exception of Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja beach and separate places in Kurzeme, cleanliness of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
Such a statement was distributed this week by the volunteers of the campaign "My Sea".
For five years, when measuring the road along the Riga seaport, activists concluded that the number of waste left by the population has increased every hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year’s critical assessment has arrived.
"We see that this will be a year when the number of waste on the beach 100 meters, perhaps, can even exceed 200 units," says J<0xC4><0x81>nis Ulme, the representative of the expedition "My Sea".
When Latvian Radio was called, he was on the beach of T<0xC5><0xAB>jas, where the voluntary walk along the sea bay of Riga will continue.
This year, among the various household wastes and picnics, activists had to collect even daylight bulbs, which were left in the sands of the washroom.
The participant and organiser of the parade Ulme says that directly the citizens are guilty of the pollution.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total number of waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, pieces of plastic, which are already in the decomposition stage, are no longer possible to identify them, and for chimneys, bottles, bottles.
There are also swimming spots in Riga among the pristine beaches.
For example, in Daugavgr<0xC4><0xAB>va, on average, almost 800 waste units are collected every 100 meters, which is critically abundant.
The organisers of the campaign also explain that I put on a step by step while also smoking and not everywhere placed warning or prohibition signs.
"The average figures for all three swimming pools in Riga together - Daugavgr<0xC4><0xAB>vu, V<0xC4><0x81>karbuli and Ve<0xC4><0x8D><0xC4><0xAB>s - unfortunately meet a large and far exceeding the desired goal, which is to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020," he said.
Swimming pool cleaning in Riga takes place every day, even twice on the hottest days of summer, explains U<0xC4><0x9F>is Vidauskis, the representative of the court.
However, the fight against unclean visitors is quite difficult.
We go back to the question of culture of these people.
"For those who indulge in alcohol, smoke and do all the things they should not do, even special signs do not work," says Vidauskis.
This is why Vidauskis invites visitors to report pollutants to the police.
You can call the police, safely point out these violations and in this way fight everyone.
Perhaps some new warnings can be put in place, but, as I said, it will hardly change the situation as radically as it is.
"Since everyone together should simply turn and be impatient of such offenders," he emphasizes.
Meanwhile, the water quality measurements have already been carried out for the fourth time this summer by the Health Inspectorate, which can impose a ban on official bathing places.
This year though, as in other years, the water quality it everywhere is good and satisfying.
At present, the situation is such that the quality of the water in all 56 bathing areas has always been good and there is no restriction on bathing.
"For the last time we will take the analysis at the end of August," says Normunds Kadi<0xC4><0xB7>is, the senior environmental health specialist at the inspection.
During heavy rainfall, the waste left on the ground can be immersed in water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, says the environmental specialist.
Rotation of the Russian elite will continue - change of leader in the Putin administration.
You left the office yourself?
Vladimir Putin told the Russian media that Sergey Ivanov left this office himself and will continue to be the president’s special representative on nature protection, ecology and transport.
In announcing the changes, Putin in front of the TV camera dedicated the words to Ivanov: "Dear Sergey Borisovich, we have been working with you for many years and we are doing it successfully."
I am satisfied with how you are fulfilling your obligations to you.
I remember very well our agreement not to use you in this office as the head of the presidential administration for more than four years.
Therefore, with understanding, I am opposed to your desire to change the field of activity.
And I hope that in the new position, too, you will make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, it is pointed out that the administration of the President is a very important office and this made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the fact that next month's elections of the State Duma in Russia, there were fears that this step was linked to the struggle for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called a possible replacement for Putin in the office of the President, so the claim that he himself wanted to take the office of the President's representative in matters of nature protection and transport has raised doubts.
According to the Lsm.lv archive, Ivanovs is the Chief Executive Officer of the VDK and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been a significant and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his career in specdienes in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanovs became his deputy.
In the end, Boris Yeltsin, the first president of Russia, was appointed secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, Ivanov's "Doctrine of Information Security" was approved, which included in Russia the revival of state censorship mechanisms.
In 2001, Sergey Ivanov became the Minister of Defense of Russia, but already in 2005 - Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of enterprises in the Russian defense sector and the export of weapons.
Now, after the resignation of the head of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also retain his place in the National Security Council of Russia, where the new head of the presidential administration Vaino will also work.
The blame comes from the elite of the family Soviet party.
The position of the head of the presidential administration Vaino was recommended by Ivanov himself.
Anton Eduardovich and I have known each other for a long time.
From the time we worked in government under your leadership.
And in the last almost five years we have been in contact practically every day.
"Therefore, I am sure that, according to all the professional and personal characteristics, he is ready for this work," Ivanovs said.
The blame comes from a family that belonged to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Karls took up high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including ten years until 1988, when he was its first secretary.
The Internet edition "Meduza" with reference to the book "Estonian Self-determination and Independence" writes that at the end of the 80s Karl Vaino, having asked Moscow to give permission to use force against the participants of the demonstration.
However, he was rejected and soon lost his job.
Soon after, Vaino has moved to live in Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from the Moscow Institute of International Relations and manages the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the President's minutes.
It has already been reported that in the last few weeks Russia has been troubled by the resignation of several high-ranking officials and even arrests, including the replacement of governors and federal representatives of several regions.
As noted by political scientists, President Vladimir Putin reshuffles the ruling elites before the upcoming elections in 2018.
One of the main features - more and more often at the leading offices are representatives of the power structures.
Also judo racer <0xC5><0xBD>ikiforenko loses the Olympic Games in the first battle.
This was the first step in the fight, and the Latvian judo race has concluded its participation in the Olympic Games, finishing 17th.
Coach Ol<0xC3><0xAB>g Baskins told Latvijas TV that there was very little hope for <0xC5><0x9A>ikiforenko, and that was already clear before the competitions.
He also discovered that the judo racehorse suffered a shoulder injury in the fight.
It is important that, in order to get to the Olympic track, <0xC5><0xBD>ikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than experienced - in other words, in the weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani race was more than 25 kilograms heavier.
It has already been reported that Yevgeny Borodavko in the weight category up to 100 kilograms against Rjunosuki lasted two and a half minutes, until the opponent got a clean victory worthy shot.
As a result, the Latvian judo competition in Rio has concluded.
Dreams disappear in the sand of Rio.
On Thursday, the jurist Yevgeny Borodavko was introduced.
Yes, he had a stronger opponent against him, but the ambitious ones are sometimes able to deliver a surprise.
He didn't answer.
For Arthur, the task of <0xC5><0x9A>ikiforenko was even more difficult, because the experience was less and the opponent was also respectful.
The result is similar, although on the tatami he lasted a half minute longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, in recent times Latvian jurists have exactly the most lack of ambition.
Since the leadership of the federation passed Gun<0xC4><0x81>rs <0xC4><0xB6>irsons and his financial stout Vladimir Shestakovs, Alexander Jackevi<0xC4><0x8D>s left Latvia, there is no longer a "Golden Score", - judo development rolls down the slope.
Jackevi<0xC4><0x8D>a, who advises Kazakh jurists here, and Vsevoldam Zelonis does not see the heirs.
But if it doesn't grow, it won't either.
And that is the prerogative of the federation.
Because of the promise of the president of the Federation of Judo of Latvia to win medals from another galaxy in the Morning Panorama.
The flight is far from reality.
In the evening we waited with patience and fear for beach volleyball matches Samoilov/<0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
Intrigue as already in the "beat" group - the losers of the game ended.
The Latvian duet had a slight deviation - could also lose, but no more than four points in two sets.
The tension was further increased in the long run by the previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling above the windscreen of the card in the length of the sword.
For the players, the changing wind has created additional complications.
At first, it seemed that it could be ours - which is the most comprehensive - ally.
But it didn't.
It was quite simple to play against the Latvian duet here.
Serves so much on Samuel and waits for him to spit.
It was against Canada, against Cuba at the end of the first set and at the beginning of the third, because the burden was not on everyone.
At the time, it was possible to go fishing because there was little work, but when it was, it was done in honor.
Brazilian Samoilov and <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x9B>din<0xC4><0x97> could win in two sets, as the first took the lead with 16:15, but on 16 also remained, squeezing the limit of the lost points.
But he could also lose by 0:2, because in the second set the deficit was -4, however, thanks to the wind, he managed to win.
The third was already covered in the drawing of the Evandru servos.
The chain was formed - an unconvinced service, the second access often flies too close to the network and Samoilov left very few options for a successful attack.
If there was a foreign Samoilov against the Cubans in the field, then this time he worked more successfully, and only on Sasha to lift the loss would be unprofessional.
He also made a mistake, and quite symbolically, the last ball in the block hit him.
Losing the team.
This time, there was a lack of success - in the third set only two Evandra attacks almost flew out of the card, but the ball still hit the line.
Two tracks were next to the line.
Also, the controversial episode of the video decided for the good of the opponents.
If in the first two games Evandru wrestled with the servers, then against ours they were very productive.
All in all, the loss was on the table.
The causes of failure must now be calmly analysed.
Perhaps, like many, you should live next to the stadium, not with a delegation in the Olympic village.
We spent two and a half hours on the road.
Perhaps a little self-confidence was given by a series of seven semi-finals.
Perhaps Klagenfurt did not have to play, but faster come here and better acclimatize.
Maybe there was a mistake with finding the top of the sporty shape.
We are waiting for a question more than an answer.
The games for our little ones are over.
The dream of medals is over.
What next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments left and also Jurmala's "Masters".
The smith with Samuel has never been friends in his life and will not be, because there are too different personalities.
But that's not necessary either.
When the dream of Olympic medals is shattered, the idea of divorce can also occur, because guilt will be sought not only in itself, but also in the partner.
It is not difficult to decide, but much more difficult in Latvia will be to find worthy partners.
Both brothers are playing drums, but J<0xC4><0x81>nis and Tom have already tried and also dived, while Mikhail Samoilov is still too green to start conquering the world's top.
You can try Harald Regju, Alexander Solovej, Edgar To<0xC4><0x8D>u, to return to Martin<0xC4><0x97> P<0xC4><0x97>vi<0xC5><0x86>a, but this will not be better than this option, which has not only proved itself in the stages of the World Cup.
The Kopacabana sand did not melt them this time.
I'm sure.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new couples come in and only a rare plant is less than two meters.
This does not guarantee success yet, but is an important argument in the fight for victory.
Our longer ones don't stay.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to get involved in the places offered by the game managers, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some of the tennis players do not stay in the Olympic Village.
Also, some beach volleyball players have searched for a hotel in Kopakaban.
This time, the prices for the most decent accommodations offered by the journalists were highly overpriced.
Therefore, the choice also falls on the apartment rent.
The risk is because sometimes they may be uncomfortable from the point of view of logistics.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich we rent apartments on the borders of Kopacabana and Ipanema.
A beach 200 metres away, a half-hour walk from the castle.
The district is quite safe, because the favela hospital, however, must not lose vigilance either.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some immediately think of, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media Vladimir Ivanovs.
P.S. It seems that on Friday morning another dream of medals was dreamed up.
Laura Ikauniec-Admidi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> is back from her personal records in the 100 metre barrier crossroad and high-rise.
But there are still five disciples.
After 10 years of interruption "Porgy and Besa" sounds in Liepaja.
In Latvia, the premiere of the opera "Porgy and Besa" was held in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been re-introduced.
That is why the organizers of the C<0xC4><0x93>sis Art Festival and Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja Art Forum decided, in close cooperation, to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy George Gershwin’s masterpiece.
"We are very pleased that after a ten-year break, when Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja was last able to enjoy the opera's performance, this great George Gershwin "Porgy and Besa" opera's concert studio version is enjoyed with us in the new, newly opened concert hall of "Litz"
Opera "Porgy and Besa" is a story about love, its inconsistency, anger, as well as the tragedies of the family and simple everyday pleasures in a bright musical language.
It reflects the African-American vitality, music and rhythms.
It is this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance makes it so vivid.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep," says director Viesturs Kairi<0xC5><0xA1>s.
What I like the most - listening to or playing this opera, there are always such stops - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, lighting one character or another personages, or choirs, or orchestras.
"It is the most exciting, this building", the opera appreciates the musical director and conductor of the concert studio of the opera "Porgy and Besa" Andris Poga.
Visitors to the opera have agreed that this is a grand event.
They are very happy to hear this world-famous opera by Gershwin.
It is sacred that in Liepaja there is only the breath of the world.
"Performance is professional", the opera is appreciated by the visitor Edgars L<0xC4><0x81>ms.
The concert studio was special with the fact that the orchestra played the orchestra for the first time in the orchestra at the newly opened concert hall "Grand Chamber" and for the first time the concert performance of the opera took place.
The field near the Museum of Art renovated buildings could be named after Jan Rozent<0xC4><0x81>l.
Riga Deputy Mayor Andris Amerikas Rozent<0xC4><0x81>l announced at the opening of the anniversary exhibition that the museum’s address in the future could also be not 10a K<0xE1><0xB9><0x9B><0xE1><0xB9><0xA3><0xE1><0xB9><0x87>a Valdemar Street, but Jan<0xC4><0x81>s Rozent<0xC4><0x81>l Square 1.
The director of the museum, M<0xC4><0x81>ra L<0xC4><0x81>ce, acknowledged that the re-registration of the address will create a serious bureaucratic burden, but in general this idea is appreciated and therefore accepted by the municipality's proposal.
The basic stage of the city of Riga has been introduced to this idea in 1936, creating a monument to Burkard Dze<0xC5><0x86>a Janim Rozent<0xC4><0x81>lam, which stands next to the museum.
William Purv<0xC4><0xAB>tis, the museum director at the time, was one of the initiators for the construction of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I have a bit of heartache all the time - but Wilhelm Purv<0xC4><0xAB>tis, where will we put his name?!
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think," said Lace.
It is reported that the building of the National Museum of Art after extensive reconstruction and modernization of its doors was officially opened in May this year.
At the end of this week, the reconstruction of the VEF Cultural Palace will begin.
The choice for about 11 million euros will be renewed SIA "Velve".
It is planned to renovate several of the castle’s premises, including two spectators’ halls, as well as buildings to accommodate people with movement disorders.
The Riga Court intends to attract <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million of funds from the European Union funds to the project, but Ol<0xC4><0xBC>egs Burovs, director of the Property Department of the Riga Court, admits that there is no complete clarity about the project for the time being on European funds.
"Despite the fact that the political will to start the VEF Cultural Palace renovation works, attracting the European Structural Funds, is, for months we are waiting for a decision, a real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, whether its money will be allocated or not," Burovs says.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission to decide for yourself that Brussels is not taking a decision here.
We are now seeing another round of discussions again, now, then we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I want to say that the Riga court guarantees without a doubt that this process will be started and completed in time," says Burov.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, VEF Kult<0xC5><0xAB>ras Castle organized a farewell concert before the immediate, immediate renovation of the building.
Although a year passed, the renovation of the building had not yet begun and continued to work collectively under inappropriate circumstances.
In the Riga Cathedral Property Department strategy, the renovation of the VEF Kult<0xC5><0xAB>ra Castle is divided into seemingly independent reconstruction works, where each will ensure the implementation of different functions of the castle.
The first is the increase in the availability of the VEF Cultural Palace and the improvement of the surrounding area.
It is intended to arrange the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as to restore the facade of the building.
The second is the improvement of the VEF Culture Palace services offer.
It plans the restoration of the interior of the building, the walls and ceilings, the improvement of the studio of the stage and sound recordings, as well as the arrangement of internal engineering communications of the building.
Third - Improvement of the collective working conditions of creative amateurs, which includes plans to improve the equipment of workshops, room heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of the legendary rock band "L<0xC4><0xAB>vu" can be seen in the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will see various objects that characterize "L<0xC4><0xAB>vus" - photographs, which are arranged in a timeline to reflect the group's activities from the beginning until 2010, when the group's activities are announced.
The participants will also be shown costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert notes, as well as other things that have not yet been seen by the general public, which reflected the creative activities of the group "L<0xC4><0xAB>vi".
The exhibition will be complemented by items from the Liepaja Museum’s collection.
Visual design of the exhibition will be carpeted in cooperation with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalnieci.
Even the musicians, who had been associated with the group "L<0xC4><0xAB>vi" and their relatives, withdrew the invitation and shared both objects and memories.
The beginnings of "L<0xC4><0xAB>vu" are sought in 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble, led by Juris Pav<0xC4><0xAB>tols, was created in the Liepaja Cultural House.
The ensemble participated in its original composition in the festival "Liep<0xC4><0x81>jas cintars" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the sights of cities and republics.
In 1976, a lucky meeting took place when Juris Pav<0xC4><0xAB>tols met Erika <0xC4><0x86>ig<0xC4><0x93>li and founded a group at Metalurgi Culture Palace, inviting Ingr<0xC4><0xAB>du G<0xC5><0xAB>tmani, Andri Kr<0xC5><0xAB>zi<0xC5><0x86>u and J<0xC4><0x81>ni Grodum to join.
Over the years, the composition of the group has changed more than once.
The participants have joined, others have gone their own way, some have returned.
However, the main thing - the desire to prove that Latvian hand music is able to live and exist - remained unchanged.
"What to see the lack of - jeans, silks and beards, these guys feel separated from the stereotype of the generally accepted performance song", says Klass Vavere, a music observer for the group.
The band has performed without the above musicians such excellent musicians as Igo, Vilnis Krievi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, Modris <0xC5><0xA0>terns, Valdis <0xC5><0xA0>tarks, Satis R<0xC4><0x81>c<0xC4><0x81>nijs, T<0xC4><0x81>lis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Br<0xC4><0xAB>ze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomas <0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x97>s
Entrance to the exhibition is free of charge.
The exhibition can be viewed from 19 August to 30 October.
On 27 August in Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja concert garden "P<0xC5><0xAB>t, wind" will take place the group "L<0xC4><0xAB>vi" 40th anniversary celebration "L<0xC4><0xAB>VIfest 2".
For the first time in 8 months, inflation is observed in Bulgaria.
In July, Bulgaria's national statistics showed 1% of monthly inflation.
This is the highest rate since 2012 and the first rate above zero since last October, when it was positive (0.2%).
The average annual CPI inflation in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous year, was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016, compared to the previous year, was 101.9% and the monthly average inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate was -0.2% (in July 2016 compared to December 2015) and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.

Zbigniew Stankevi<0xC4><0x8D>s: The time is coming, and the truth is on the way.
The Archbishop of the Catholic Church of Latvia, Zbigniew Stankevi<0xC4><0x8D>s, in an interview with the Independent, emphasizes that if we want to gain strength in life, the message of the Gospel should be at the center of it.
For the power of truth is greater than the power of evil.
Many are already on their way to the Feast of the Assumption of the Most Holy Virgin Mary in Aglona.
What messages will the faithful receive this year?
In recent years, the Pope’s nuncio has expressed his desire to lead the main service in Aglona.
Therefore, the main content of the message is also in his view.
The tradition of its kind is also reflected in the fact that the Bishop of the Way of the Cross, J<0xC4><0x81>nis Bulis, presides over the Way of the Cross.
He will also make his own message.
On the previous day, I was in charge of the vigil service.
Last year I will turn to the Pope’s French encyclical “Laudato si” and update it on the common home, Earth theme in the Latvian context.
This year... of course, I've been watching what's going on in the world and trying to respond to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with the church’s recommendation that the message of the Gospel be placed at the center of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems in human life and gives him an inspiration for the way forward.
Then it speaks to people.
But in C<0xC4><0x93>sis, in the discussion of the Lamp, you said that "it goes back to the understanding of the full man".
What do you understand?
Does this mean that a person avoids the message of the church?
And does the church have such a return resource today?
In the Indian capital, a man who died on the side of the road.
In the Indian capital, no one has even heard of a man who died on the side of the road - it turns out that he spent an hour on the side of the road and then was still crowded, reports the BBC.
It has been reported that a man who was identified as Matib<0xC3><0xBC>l, was driving with a rickshaw during the day, but at night worked as a guard.
Matthew 5:30 a.m. went home on the road when he got into a light car.
The recording of the surveillance camera shows that the driver dropped out of the car to look at the victim, and then drove away.
After an hour, when no one has left or knows about the bleeding man, he was rounded up by someone in the ward.
About 90 minutes after the incident, the police arrived at the scene and the victim was taken to the hospital, where he died of the trauma.
When withdrawing his candidacy to the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), Inga Kol<0xC4><0xAB>gova, head of the State Environmental Service, has improved the government from the fall, says Oj<0xC4><0x81>rs Skudra, associate professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
Kol<0xC4><0xAB>ga's explanation of the withdrawal of the candidacy in connection with the conflict-ridden coalition is due to the fact that it has prevented the fall of the government.
In an interview with the agency LETA, Skudra showed that it is difficult for him to imagine that he would support Kol<0xC4><0xAB>ga's candidacy at the next session of the government.
Therefore, if the ministers of the "Union" voted against and Kol<0xC4><0xBC>egov so approved, this would lead to the resignation of the government.
The expert also believes that before the announcement on the withdrawal of the candidacy Kol<0xC4><0xBC>egov has consulted with both the Minister of Finance Danu Reiznieci-Ozol and the Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ri Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inski.
At the same time, it is also an accession to the "Unity", which strongly opposed her candidacy.
When predicting whether to find a suitable candidate with the help of the competition, Skudra acknowledged that there are two options - either a compromise figure will be chosen, or the institution will continue to lead Dace Pel<0xC4><0x93>ka as the Director-General.
At the same time, he points out - if the Minister of Finance has so far claimed that no other candidacy is being considered, it is a home for the Grey that he should not participate in the competition.
LETA has already announced that the head of the State Environmental Service Kol<0xC4><0xAB>gova has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director General of the VID.
Due to the opposition of "unity", the government on Tuesday postponed the approval of Kol<0xC4><0xAB>geva in the post of Director General of VID.
After the government's decision to postpone the decision, Kol<0xC4><0xAB>gova confirmed that he is still ready to become the head of the VID.
However, it later changed its mind - on Friday presented to Finance Minister Dani Reizniece-Ozolai she points out that she withdraws her consent to move to the position of head of the VID and this is not an easy choice for her.
Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ra Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inska press secretary Andrejs Vaivars explained to the agency LETA that a new competition will be held for the position of Director General of the VID.
In the center of Riga there was an accident involving a police car.
In the center of Riga this afternoon there was a road traffic accident involving a State Police car.
The police car with the sound and light signals turned on will be on the call of the highest category until it collides with another car at the intersection of K<0xE1><0xB9><0x9B><0xE1><0xB9><0xA3><0xE1><0xB9><0x87>a Barona and Dzirnavu Street.
The police explain the circumstances, but the initial information shows that the second crash did not start without a police car.
A woman was injured in an accident.
This year in Riga the number of inhabitants has collapsed
At the beginning of this year there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when the capital had officially registered 641 000 inhabitants, the agency was informed by the Central Statistical Office (CSP).
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and large cities, where the population exceeds one million.
According to the EU statistics office "Eurostat" in Riga is the largest proportion of women - the capital of Latvia is the first among the largest European cities with 127 women per 100 men.
In all three capitals of the Baltic states, the proportion of women in Europe's largest cities is highest: in Vilnius there are 123, but in Tallinn there are 121 women per 100 men.
At LNMM, place the warning pictograms.
In the coming days, warning signs will be placed at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM) - pictograms, the representative of the Riga Cathedral Property Department Baiba Gail<0xC4><0xAB>te told the agency LETA.
At present, the museum has successfully completed the repair of the glazed rapid damage that had occurred as a result of the work of skateboarders.
The warning pictograms will be placed next to it in the next few days.
Its residents will be told that the cover tends to be slippery during rain and snow, so they must not move by cars, as well as visit by bicycles, skateboards and skateboards.
On that social network "Facebook" at the time also wrote Ushakovs, who pointed out that no security threats do not cause damage, but "looks inaccurate", and skateboarders "will come to sneeze".
Celebrations for children and parents- New children's playgrounds are set up in Riga.
This summer, the Municipality of Riga has even installed two new playgrounds in the city, Kipsala and <0xC4><0x8C>iekurkalna, which are now available to children.
A wide, multifunctional toy ship with a variety of climbing elements, bridges, games, pipes and ski lifts is installed on the beach of Kipsala.
The playground is intended for children of all ages.
The field also includes the installation of bubbles and various balancing elements.
The world of fantasy for small boaters expands the location of the attraction on the Daugava coast with a view of the passenger port and the cruise ships visible there.
On the other hand, in the playground between <0xC4><0x8C>iekurkalna 4th and 5th cross-line, a playhouse, drums, stairway, balance bridge, swings, toy balls and other elements of the game, as well as a gym with rings of strength and coordination exercises, etc.
Under the field, the rubber cover is coated in a variety of colors.
A new, colorful birch cover is applied to the playground from the street side.
A reconstructed stage of the road has been discovered in the medumas.
The Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the management of the State Roads of Latvia (LVC), as well as the representatives of the builders SIA "Binders" and the municipal authorities today opened the main road of the reconstructed country of the Russian border (Grebneva) -R<0xC4><0x93>zekne-Daugavpils-Metuvas (No.13-Lithuva)
Roads are a national road map, especially the border roads, so it is a special pleasure to discover a reconstructed phase along the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the fact that the co-financing of the European Union funds improves the situation on national highways.
"As the forecasts show, the funds available for roads during this planning period will be acquired already in 2018, and we need to think how to continue to maintain the most busy highways in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of the population in all regions of Latvia without crossing the border of the European Union", Ul<0xC4><0xAB>velis said.
The Minister of Transport also pointed out that the proposals prepared by the traffic experts for sustainable financing of Latvia’s roads will be presented in the government in the near future.
Construction works in the phase from Medjumas to the Lithuanian border (156.4.-163.05. km) SIA Binders started last year and this year they continued after a technological break.
The cost of reconstruction is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>13.5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"In the reconstructed phase of the road there is a completely restored road construction and next year repair work will be started in the next stage from Medjumas to Daugavpils itself, so the whole road will be arranged from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils", informed the chairman of the board of the LVC J<0xC4><0x81>ngeis.
The country's main highways are the busiest, and by 2018, we plan to make sure that all the country's main highways are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, ensuring periodic maintenance in a timely manner and to make asphalt surface replacement every 7-9 years.
"It will, of course, require adequate funding, and all travelers look forward with hope to the proposals developed by the expert group for the arrangement of the road financing system," Lange said.
Within the framework of the project organized road connections and lighting in the center of Medum.
Substantial land works were carried out: large-scale decoupling in four stages and extensive excavation and reinforcement works, a balanced road-long profile, which had hitherto been very uneven.
There is also a refurbishment of public transport stops and a re-built turning area for public transport.
Previously, the road had insufficient capacity and the terrain relief was not visible due to the mountainous valleys, as well as the old road joint relief.
During the next construction season, it is planned to renew the highway phase from the border of the city of Daugavpils to the now reconstructed phase (144,80.-156.40. km).
This year, the LVC plans to carry out various types of work more than 1100 kilometers of the state road.
Information about all the repairs planned on the national highway network this year is available on the LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
“In order to achieve the desired weight loss results, it is very important to choose the right combination of food products,” says Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene, a Lithuanian dietitian.
In addition, it is easy to do during the summer period, when our own gardens grow fresh fruits, berries and vegetables.
The combination of thought-provoking diet products can help not only reduce excess weight, but also purposefully promote various body processes.
Macaroni and etiquette are a successful combination, as it provides a long-lasting satiety feeling and helps to fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that etiquette has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us to feel fuller.
Caffeine peppers and protein-rich foods, such as poultry meat or protein cocktails, cause not only a feeling of satiety, but also reduce cravings after large meals in the next meal.
The combination of such foods can also increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35%.
Studies have shown that cayenne peppers can help to get rid of fatty tissue in the abdominal area.
The composition of the beer contains a nutrient that promotes metabolism - choline, while pepper is a good source of vitamin C.
By taking a sufficient amount of this nutrient, you can lower your cortisol levels, hence also fat accumulation around the middle part of your body.
Oatmeal powder, to which fresh berries are added, is another delicious and fat-burning meal for breakfast, which is worth to include in your menu.
Herbs and berries contain fiber that, according to Canadian scientists, controls the feeling of hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin, and thus hunger.
In addition, berries contain polyphenols, which are helpful in weight loss and also prevent the formation of fats.
Vegetables and also protein can do wonders in weight-loss.
Such a combination can create a feeling of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, which is why they promote a feeling of satiety.
At the same time, the protein slows down the digestion process and provides a feeling of satiety for a longer time.
At lunchtime, you can eat chicken with salads or make a cocktail of protein from the ready-made mixture and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
What combinations of products to avoid.
Fruits contain sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
On the other hand, the starch found in vegetables is polysaccharide.
Fruits divide the stomach mechanically, while chemically they do not divide until they reach the third or fourth degrees in the digestive process that occurs in the intestines.
The disease is divided into three different stages, which begin already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
When eating a sweet meal immediately after a meal, it is "stuck" in the stomach along with other foods, where it is not chemically secreted and begins to rot.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, beans, bananas, dates or other carbohydrate-containing products with lemons, lime, oranges, grapefruit, pineapple or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptialin, which is located in the sieve, works only in a alkaline environment.
Fruit acids prevent not only the breakdown of carbohydrates, but also promote their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and a combination of products rich in milk and similar proteins at one meal.
For their processing, different digestive juices are needed, each of them with a different strength, features and time when it is necessary to reach the stomach.
Arbouz, medusmelone, muscatmelone and other melons should always be eaten separately from other foods.
Melons are not digested if they are present in the stomach along with other foods.
Fats in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with solids, however the same can not be said for fats and proteins - fats prevent the breakdown of proteins.
Proteins can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large amount of protein-containing products are consumed, avoid the use of fats altogether.
It also applies to freshening - it is not recommended to combine a large amount of nut (containing protein) with a whole avocado (containing fat).
Such a combination prevents effective weight loss.
How to cook better?
"Cooking food, heat treatment causes a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the product's original nutrient composition," says the dietitian.
In most cases, nutrients are lost by cooking food products in water.
However, the value of certain nutrients in foods increases by directly cooking.
After cooking vegetables, it is recommended to use the remaining liquid for the preparation of soups - in this case, you will not lose the nutrients that remained in the water, and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended to prepare the vegetables, also by steaming them.
Thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene, which is composed of tomatoes.
Taking the tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
Thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The thermal processing of beer and meat takes away the natural properties of the proteins present in them, making them more easily digestible.
The heat treatment of meat and eggs also makes the iron and other minerals that are present in these products more easily absorbable in the body.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, although the freezing of fibre does not affect.
In combination with tomatoes, beans can increase the absorption of iron in the body, which in turn provides better brain and muscle function.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-sanitary iron found in plant products such as beans, leafy greens, cereal products, than in animal products such as beef, fish and fish.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-bleaching iron in the body by taking products containing non-bleaching iron in the diet along with sources of vitamin C such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change the non-bloody iron in such a way that our body absorbs it more easily.
Iron is needed for the production of hemoglobin, which provides oxygen supply to the muscles and brain.
To get the maximum benefit from salads, add to them healthy fats such as olive or linseed oil.
When preparing buttermilk with a straw, add an extra-free yogurt rich in vitamin D to the strawberry or sardines, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestines, and it plays an important role in the bone formation process.
Oats (as well as other whole grains) together with sources of vitamin C such as strawberries, raspberries, raspberries and other fruits or berries, help to stabilize cholesterol levels and also avoid the deterioration of the arteries.
Snapchat's "Anime" Effect Criticizes Asian Caricature
Snapchat representatives say that this filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators say that it is racistally insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users every day in a completely absurd way to change reality and play with their identity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or an image that would fit in the painting of Roja Liechtenstein.
Lenses are foggy, image-clogging tools that generate more than 30 million transformed selfies per day.
Any mistake quickly becomes public noticeable.
Snapchat’s lens effects have already been criticised in the past, receiving hints that the app popularizes too black-eyed or light-skinned tones as an ideal benchmark for beauty.
This week, new lens effects were published that allow users to form eyelashes, cheek teeth and round cheeks, and some critics dubbed it a racist Asian caricature – the “yellow gem”.
The question was also raised whether such contradictions do not indicate that the company has greater problems with diversity.
News and public denials broke out on Wednesday, when The Verge and Motherboard reported that the lens effects had been removed from the app.
The company explained that the objective of the lens is to depict Anime images, not to caricature people of Asian origin.
However, for people who have experienced racism, these effects were reminiscent of painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied similarity to Anime.
Students of Korean-American art Greisas Sparapani's Twitter record about the images got a wide resonance. In an email she points out that the lens effects are "irritating and uncomfortable not to say more".
She added that it is difficult not to see the visible similarity between Asian caricatures and the effects of lenses.
This shows that the lens effect is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face in the understanding of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that is embedded in these cultural gaps.
American culture is also involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, ranging from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use on a daily basis.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people, representing different races, unlike the older population, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "these days such things are not forgotten", 25-year-old Keitia Zhou said in an interview Thursday.
Thursday, <0xC5><0xBD>ou, the head of Medium products, deleted his Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her article "Medium" and in a telephone interview, she explained that in her opinion, problems with race arise because of Snapchat's employment policy, which does not adequately support race diversity.
Zhou criticized the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men, and then concluded his article with the reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there are no racial differences in the company, so the following decisions are allowed. Whether the company employs some other racial representatives, but they do not take such a position as to be able to safely and conveniently express their opinion," said a Chinese source in the United States.
Her opinion is also agreed by others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not reveal how many employees represent different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origins of its employees, but its representative revealed that the company has hired a staff specialist who will focus on representing racial minorities in the company, who are not widely represented and will contribute to the inclusion of the company.
Zhou, meanwhile, will not renew his Snapchat account, adding: "Interestingly, do they really need more users like us to understand that it's not right."
The House of Congress says that military officials have changed the reports on the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the congressional court said that representatives of the U.S. Central Command had altered the reports, portraying the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria much more optimistic than it actually is.
The analysts of the Central Command Intelligence Service expressed general dissatisfaction with the interim report of the task force established by the representatives of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Defence Finance, indicating that their management was in control of the alert.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report is that intelligence reports confirmed by the top-ranked leaders of Centcom reflect the U.S. fight against terrorism more positively than it actually is. The facts were regularly modified to portray better achievements, failures.
California Republican Representative Ken Calverts says: "Centcom's actions are unacceptable - our soldiers are the ones who suffer if our policymakers get the wrong messages."
Centcom management errors are sought by the top management of the organization.
This 10-page long report details the existing problems in the reflection of the Central Command and analyses the efforts of the Americans to prepare the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While this does not provide irrefutable evidence that the Obama administration’s senior officials have been reluctant to reverse the reports, it does indicate that Centcom’s leadership has put some pressure on analysts to portray a more optimistic view of ISIL as an Islamic State (ISIL) or an Islamic State (ISIL).
The report states that in the first half of 2015 the Central Administration's press releases, statements and reports to Congress portrayed the situation in a significantly more positive light than it actually was.
For example, representatives of Centcom publicly announced that the Mosul recovery operation could begin as early as April 2015 or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq’s second largest city, which is still under Islamic State control.
The Kansas Republican Party's representative, Mike Pompeo, said in his report: "The investigation of several months clearly confirms this."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the U.S. Central Administration’s top officials reversed the reports, portraying ISIS’s threats to Iraq weaker than they actually were.
The Republican Party has set up a working group, learning that analysts are afraid that information about the Islamic State is being altered.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings in this case.
The Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence shall conduct an investigation into the activities of the Centcom Intelligence Service.
On Thursday, the members of the Democratic Party of the Committee of Inquiry Management published their own report in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Party working group.
In his report, Democrat Representative Adams B. Schifs said that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom had too much restriction on the preparation of intelligence evaluation reports related to ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr Schiff explained that this process "stopped the dissemination of information", worsened the work ethic of analysts and "distributed facts that did not correspond to the truth."
But Schiff and members of the Democratic Party added that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to develop reports according to "pre-determined or political stances".
The Daily Beast published the provisional results of the congressional investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon’s Inspector General had launched an investigation into the complaints of Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans announced that the Pentagon will not comment on the Congressional report until further investigation has been carried out.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Directorate calls for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement made by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defense).
But last year's accusations cast doubt on whether President Obama can fully rely on the Central Administration's reports of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Criticism of Islamic State exploration is reminiscent of more than a decade ago when Centcom exploration analyst Gregory Huckers published a study, claiming that the George W. Bush administration started the war in Afghanistan, thinking too little of its possible consequences.
Hawkers also played an important role in uncovering the issue of Islamic State exploration.
Last year, officials reported that the Huker team revealed that, contrary to public reports, airlifts to the Islamic State oil factories had not significantly deteriorated the mood of the terrorist group's financial situation, as they had been overcrowded.
The Times reported in a September issue that this discovery did not occur outside the walls of the Central Administration.
At the time, Commander-in-Chief of Centcom, General Lloyd Austin III, received critical acclaim, as many lawmakers felt that reports of war described the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin retired, and General Joseph L. Votels took his place. . . .
The United States in a duel with the United Kingdom in women's field hockey, wins the United States, thus winning the fourth consecutive victory.
The day after the victory over Japan with a score of 6:1, on Thursday Keitia Bama won the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team, when the Americans won the Indian team with a score of 3-0.
Five goals in two games is an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bama said she couldn’t remember if she had ever done anything like that.
She said, "I don't have feelings."
I'm not one of those people who count their gates.
But she knows that the result of the Americans in the Olympics is 4:0, which gives them in their group indistinguishable from the United Kingdom, which on Thursday after the victory over Japan with a result of 2:0 remained unbeaten.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday to play their last match in the first round of the game.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals and the game will determine only which team will take first place in the group of six teams and which second.
The first-place finisher will avoid meeting the strong Dutch team, which is the leader of the second group, for a little longer.
Despite the fact that Saturday’s game will not be played, the Americans have already caused a surprise storm, before four years in London taking last place between 12 teams.
There was also a Bama in that team.
She grew up in Bl<0xC3><0xB8>bela, took her first field hockey knife in her hands at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters had already engaged in this type of sport in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming a young boy of choice.
She did not attend the 2008 Olympic Games because she did not enter the final.
However, 2012 was a failure for her and her team.
The following year, England coach Kregs Parhams was appointed and everything changed on the right side.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical changes."
We have not invested as much in London as we do now.
We have completely changed everything.
In Thursday’s game, Bama revealed the result by winning the gates in the first half with a back-to-back shot from a close distance.
India started the game without a win in their account, but their selection was very lively and kept the minimum score 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama again won the gates.
She entered the ball into the opponent zone on the left side of the field, then noticed going to the center of the field and knocking the ball into the opponent's gates, leading the Americans 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzalez won another goal.
This was the first game of the U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs in the dry, in each of the first three games by scoring on one goal.
She's in a coma.
And so does Bama.
"We are doing very well right now," Pahams said, but just as well, the game will be shown on Saturday.
The most depressing meal of the period of depression is the "Satisfied meal"
In March 1933, shortly after the election to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the ovary to hold a meal.
President Roosevelt had a taste of fine culinary delicacies such as goose liver pastry, or in a bird’s paradise, and Maryland’s broth soup.
But at the same time, his meal was much more pleasant: filled with eggs in tomato sauce, potato thicket and dessert - a plum pudding.
Jane Ziegelmane says, "It's a way to stand in solidarity in cooking with people who got on very hard."
Her husband Andrew Kou adds: "It's also a message to Americans how they should eat."
A couple of the Brooklyn Heights area are food historians.
Some of the most recent books in the book "Garlic Sauce" describe Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelmane in his book "97 Apples" describes life through a restaurant rental house in the eastern part of Manhattan.
Their new joint work "Satisfied Meal," which will be published Tuesday in Harper's edition, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some solidarity in the cuisine, they held a meal together with reporters at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple luncheon located in the Flatiron area and operating since 1929, when the Great Depression began.
Mrs Ziegelman, 54, ordered buttermilk with melted cheese and chopped olives, while 57-year-old Kou ordered turkeys, potato chips and vegetable salads.
When the reporter ordered a fake rabbit, the couple admitted that his choice is very appropriate for the conversation about the Great Depression-era food .
Mrs Ziegelman said that the fake rabbit was very popular.
There was an earthenware rabbit, a liver rabbit, and a bean rabbit.
They were made from the basic ingredient and other ingredients that enriched the diet plan.
Imagine how it is - to eat so many peanuts that they are in place for lunch.
Mr. Kou was upset.
"It just seemed like the belly was full of lead," he added.
During the pre-depression years, the American lunch table was similar to the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were preparing to eat to their husbands-workers, and freshly prepared recipes were provided for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
During the First World War, it was precisely the Americans who sent Europeans food. "Satisfied meal" was described as how Americans adapted to the conditions when America suddenly was no longer the land of abundance.
“At the time, food became the main focus of the American people in everyday life,” Mr. Kou says, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write directly about this topic.
Just as important became the new budget diets: such unknown foods as fake rabbits and sausages became everyday, the sausages were "a great way to use the leftovers," noted Mrs Ziegelmanes, because the cooks could hide the unattractive sausages.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which for many years was the main ingredient in American dishes, has now become an extremely rare luxury item.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of food were more important than taste, new, yet unseen formations were born.
In an old cookbook, Mrs. Ziegelman found a recipe for making onions filled with peanut butter.
Mr Kou adds: "It was not a popular addition to the lunch table."
Mrs Ziegelmane stresses: "It was sirereal."
Soybean butter and pepper onions are not compatible.
Many home-cooked recipes were applied to difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office of Household Economics from 1923 to 1943, set out the eating habits of the state, which had not been experienced either before or after the Great Depression.
When publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they recommended that households become "economists" and accept challenges such as turning pasta and carrot mix into a tasty meal.
"Satigal Malt<0xC4><0xAB>te" is a lover of historical tastes.
What is particularly interesting is the government's attitude towards its starving citizens, such as the attitude of President Herbert Hubert Hubert Hubert "let me eat cake".
While he talked publicly about his simple childhood and eating in Iowa, in fact he ate like a fine millionaire, which he had become.
Mr Kou says: "He liked European cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce."
He ate in an almost gilded living room wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely lost in reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleonora had not recommended him to show an example of his eating habits.
The book tells us that Roosevelt hired a waiter who did not teach how to cook, thus the White House became a place "where not only was one of the most delicious dishes in Washington, D.C., but also the worst-prepared food."
As soon as the national economy recovers, most of the signatures of the Depression era cuisine disappear.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutritional value, as well as how science is used in cooking, added Mrs Ziegelman.
The couple says that when they wrote the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as why she was unable to throw food out.
"She was really afraid to throw food out," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs Ziegelman said: "She actually screwed people."
Once upon a time there was an incident with wind cookies.
When we had eaten at Eisenberg’s dining room, a couple of writers pulled out of the bag a dessert made at home: a puff of plums that President R<0xC3><0xBC>zvelts was allowed to eat at lunchtime.
"It's plum pudding," said Mrs Ziegelmanes, adding that at the time it was common for decent foods to give a chic name.
It does not contain powder, only dried plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
All impatiently dipped the carrots in the brown mass, which was on the slices.
Amazingly, it wasn’t that bad.
Mr Kuu ate a few more bites.
Listening to an experienced "economist", he said to his wife: "I'd like to eat a slice of a crushed stick nut."
Gilead to receive reimbursement for legal expenses in the fight against Merck for Hepatitis C patent
The District Judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. has the right to recover expenses for legal services it has paid in the case of the Hepatitis C patent infringement against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted of a <0xC2><0xA3>200 million fine for two Merck patent theft, which threatened it in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when a US federal judge found violations of Merck's action, such as a lie after a lawsuit.
On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bets Labsons Freemens pointed out that Gilead has the right to claim compensation for the legal expenses incurred by it in defending itself in this case.
Merck is trying to gain a position in the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with the new generation of Hepatitis C drugs, which are effective in 90% of cases of liver disease.
The case was launched in 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to obtain ownership of the newly developed active ingredient sofosbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead medicine.
The U.S.-backed forces claim to have completely taken control of the city of Manbij from the Islamic State.
U.S.-backed forces have completely taken control of the northern part of the city of Manbij near the Turkish border and the last Islamic State troops have left the city, the group’s representative said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) is currently cleaning up the city from the last enemy fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 Khalilians-civilians who had been captured by fighters, the news agency Reuters told <0xC5><0xA0>arfans Darvi<0xC5><0xA1> of the SDS-allied Military Council of Manbij.
"At the moment, the city is completely under our control and we are conducting a search for fighters," he told Reuters.
Clint's income in 2015 reached 10.75 million dollars and the couple paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton published the 2015 tax return on Friday, which shows that the Democratic Party presidential candidate and her husband have earned $10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent, respectively.
During 2015, Clinton has donated $1 million to his Clinton charity. Former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million, standing as a clerk and former Secretary of State has earned $3 million in his public service, and has earned a salary of $3 million.
Clinton's election ally - U.S. State Senator Tim Keen and his wife Anna Holtone have published their tax returns for the past 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Keins continue to set new financial transparency standards," Clinton campaign partner Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
On the other hand, Donald Trump is hiding behind a variety of incentives and rebates so that he does not have to fulfill his promises to disclose his tax information.
The publication of paid tax information is a record practice for U.S. presidential candidates, but it is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his attorney min State Revenue Service audit as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your move", in his Twitter post, was reported by Clinton campaign partner Ian Sams on the Democratic Party candidate's tax information.
On Thursday, Trump's special adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax information before the audit was completed.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican Party presidential candidate Mits Romney and other Republicans, claim that his refusal raises questions about his real estate, donation amounts, and other business commitments, including ties to the Crimea.
Clinton caught up with the oil fire by publishing a video on Friday, where several influential Republicans asked Trump to publish his tax information.
She returned to this issue again during the economic talk on Thursday in Michigan.
She told the effort: "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have been doing for decades."
Politico reports that during the 1990s, Trump paid very little or no taxes at all, and on Friday, the author of the New York Times business column reported that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed even today.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in these presidential elections.
Clinton, in support of billionaire Varena Bafet's proposal, popularises the idea that anyone who earns more than $1 million a year must pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
During Clinton’s speech last week in Omaha, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is also located, Buffett called on Trump to exchange tax returns.
Buffett stated that he too is being audited by the Revenue Service and Trump is afraid of voters, not the tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information up to 2007.
Now Klintoni lives in <0xC4><0x8C>apakva, New York and between 2007 and 2014 has paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent and a total tax rate of about 40,5 percent.
Clinton’s 2015 tax report shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clinton dividends have received $109,000.

Jewish film director criticises hotel in Berlin for unlocking Israel’s phone code on request of an Arab - RT News
The director of French films of Jewish origin called the storm on social media when he discovered that the Israeli telephone code was not available at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin. The hotel staff based it on the demand of Arab customers.
Clods Lancman, documentary about the Holocaust director "Shoah", did not hide his dissatisfaction with Berlin's Kempinski Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During the recent stay, Lancmans tried to find the Israel phone code in the list offered by the hotel.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries that can be called directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been looted and destroyed?
Write Lancmans.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol hotel offers to call this country through its call center.
The director asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the received answer "shocked them".
The hotel administrator explained that "it is a conscious decision of the hotel management".
The reason for the removal of the code was even more denied by the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they demanded the deletion of the Israeli code," Lancmans quoted the hotel employee as saying.
The Suddeutsche Zeitung reports that the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jakov Hadas-Handelsman, has been referred to as the "big goat".
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
The same for itself is a big shame.
And the fact that this has happened right in Germany, right in this network of hotels there is even greater degradation.
Explanations are not required.
The official said: "We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions."
This event also gained quite a broad resonance on the internet, where people denounced it as a scandal.
Others believe that "Kempinski" hotel is simply made for Arab customers.
Another inscription said to "come back", indicating that the hotel is located on Kurfurstendamm Street next to the synagogue.
The publication Der Spiegel reports that the hotel itself quickly rejected all objections, stating that it was all a "comprehension" and apologized to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the country number list," the Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted Kempinski as saying.
And add that the code has been added to the list again.
The police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The student and police clash took place on Thursday in the city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against reforms of the government education system.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas against the students.
The problems started when law enforcement tried to get the students out, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
The demonstration was attended by several hundred students to express their dissatisfaction with the reforms of the education system.
The proposal of the Governor of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Geraldo Alckmina, plans to close almost 100 public schools, while 300,000 students will be transferred to other schools in order to save money.
Some protesters drew graffiti on the walls with messages against interim president Michael Temer.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations in order to express support for the late President Dilma Roussef, whose impeachment was voted on by the Senate.
Scotland Kelum Skiners finish first in the UK to bring gold medals in cycling to the UK
Kelum Skiners of Scotland finished first in the men's cycling team sprint race at the Rio Velodrome, which took place last night. The British team defended its champion title, which it won at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in these races, making a proud legendary scotch Seru Kris Hoju and lifting the win for the favourites of New Zealand.
Four years ago, Great Britain won a surprising victory when Hoys won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they did it again at the World Championships in London, although Hoys had already finished his sports career.
The problems were at the stage between the Beijing and London Olympics, as experienced start-up specialist Jamie Staff had to be replaced.
They did it at the last minute.
When Hoiss left, his place was trying to fill Kian's Emadi and Mets Kramptons.
The British coaches put hope in Skiner, considering the potential that he later also proved in him.
India, Kenya - champions who started four years ago with Hoj and Skiners, who set the Olympic qualification record, but the better start of the race was for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
Hinds after his circle were in close quarters, Kenya took the lead and Skinner protected the lead.
The change in strategy played an important role in the victory, as the Indians drove with a larger shift to allow Kenya and especially Skinner to drive faster.
Hojs saw the race as a representative of the BBC and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenya and Hindesa at the time they climbed the podium.
The 23-year-old glassmaker said, "It was an unspeakable insult."
I do everything I can to defend my name.
In the final we set the Olympic record and won the World Champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better victory.
After winning with Kenya and Hoi An at the 2012 London Olympics, the Indians acknowledged that they had deliberately fallen onto the track after a failed start.
He later rebutted these comments, and the British competitors were not in a position to prove otherwise.
This time there was no such incident.
Hindes said: "The British flags in the stands recalled in memory of London."
During the last 3 months we have become a trusted team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the victory in the Olympic Games was really special.
One medal will be won by a country that has won seven of the ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is a team progression indicator over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of the results of Kenya, he could indeed repeat Hoj’s successes by winning three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, it would mean six gold medals and one silver medal. In addition, Kenya was born on March 23rd (it seems to be a British holy date, as this day was also born Stephen Regrev, Mo Farah and Rogers Banisters).
This date is also born Hoys.
Kenya’s next race is the sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said: “Right now I’m just enjoying it all.
Team travel is always the best.
Because then you can win along with team members.
If honest, winning one is a little lonely.”
Hindes said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be placed in the rank of a soldier."
On that day it was the only battle for medals, but they were not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Vignes, Ed Klensijs, Steve Burks and Oveins Douls showed the fastest qualifying time in a four-kilometre race for four.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record, which was set in London in 2012, is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final will take place today in the second half, where Vigins will definitely be in the spotlight.
Yesterday, before the qualifying trip, he had a disagreement with the police station when the judges called him to measure his height.
In the women's race, which will continue and end today, Laura Trot, Joanna Roussell Shanda, Elinor Barker and Keith Archibald from Milnavija set a new record time of 4:13,260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team, hoping to win the medals in the mid-term of the Olympic Games.
With the excellent and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone is looking forward to the same achievements as Rio.
In the meantime, after accusations of sexism and defamation, technical director Shein Satons has stepped down, and Hojs and Victoria Bendleton also end their careers.
However, starting with the first velodrome races, it seems that the UK will always reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of Portland's landfill is becoming unclear, as a major contract has been terminated.
The future of the aluminium foundry and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria has become unclear as its main customers of the energy company have announced the termination of the cooperation.
This Communication is based on the Victorian Government's plans to discontinue subsidising the energy company, which is vitally important for the company to continue its work.
The 20-year subsidy will be discontinued in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs at the Alkoas Portland factory are at risk.
Up to 2000 both direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side effects, as the melting pot consumes about 10 percent of all of Victoria's electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry dumpster, which led to the interruption of the operation of the Anglesea Power Station.
The Alkoas Portland Cupboard works with losses and can be closed.
These events were caused by several years of speculation about the rise in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of production of the factory.
The plant's energy supplier AGL, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power station in Latroube Street, says that the other three owners are likely to also terminate their contracts.
Most of the power stations are owned by the Alcoa and Alumia Joint Undertaking, and in addition to the parts of the company are owned by China CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding companies.
"AGL hopes for the continuation of the operations of the Portland plant, which would mean a future energy supply to the melting pot," said its representative.
The AGL indicated that the contracts are so-called "risk-restricting contracts", which are scheduled to enter into force from November 2016.
The agreements have a 12-month validity period and will therefore be in force until 2017.
"AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in fiscal year 2017," said the company's representative.
Starting from the 2018 fiscal year, the potential impact on profit is limited by the forecasts of a favourable market for wholesale prices of electricity in the future.
AGL claims that its forecasts have already calculated losses in the amount of $187 million , assuming that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa states that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa’s ability to continue the operation of the melting pot or to supply it with energy.
The U.S. company said it had signed a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years in 2010, but that it would be terminated in November. The company does not provide any explanation as to why it would cease cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concern about both the possible closure of the Portland warehouse in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago factory near Newcastle, due to the weak economy in the industry.
Stephen Michaelson, executive director of AGL, said last week that, according to analysts’ estimates, 600 megawatts and 900 megawatts of energy were used during the year in Portland.
If both of these factories exit the energy market, then the energy demand will be significantly reduced.
And that would not be good at all.
The Community legal centre shall reject 160 000 persons each year.
More than 160,000 people are rejected each year, and the situation could deteriorate by reducing the budget.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight against illegal layoffs - are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community Legal Centre, which has already been overloaded, warns that the situation will only get worse if funding is reduced.
As early as next June, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than they have ever been.
James Farels, director of the Queensland Legal Center, said the latest report from the National Legal Centers Association says that legal aid is currently being denied to thousands of people who need it.
Mr Farels pointed out that if this decision is not repealed, then the situation will only get worse.
He also says: "The legal centre of Queensland is constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that aid is being rejected by thousands of people who need it."
For people who are trying to end a violent relationship, for people with deep debt, for families who are experiencing divorce, for workers who are unfairly discharged - all of these people have problems of a legal nature and this report shows that they do not suffer.
As of June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30 percent, which means that several thousand more residents of Queensland will have to solve their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately stop the reduction of funding so that people in need of legal assistance can get it.
Last year, the government unveiled its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to pay attention to the needs of the local communities and their clients and to the Government of Palazchuk to invest in this important sphere.
Donald Trump’s campaign sued in court because one of his employees pulled out a gun
NEW YORK: Organizers of Donald Trump’s campaign have been sued for failing to act informing them that their North Carolina operations manager had turned a gun on an employee when they drove in a car in February.
This incident was described in a lawsuit filed by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign programmer, in Charlotte’s court on Wednesday.
Bordini said that he had been waiting for months for the internal review of this matter to begin, but understood that it would not happen.
“He pulled out a gun, put his right index finger on the wheel and turned the pole against Vincent’s wheel,” Bordini said in his complaint.
He also claimed that by filing complaints to local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four more people had experienced the same.
"Weapon does not need to be detonated to cause damage," Bordini said in his complaint.
Just two days before the case was filed, the Republican candidate for the presidency caused a scandal by notifying people that the "People of the Second Amendment", i.e. gun owners and enthusiasts, could act if the election was won by the winner.
Representatives of the Trump campaign announced that the media had pulled his words out of context, and he never yelled at anyone for violence.
Bordini wants to receive compensation from the campaign organizers for negligent surveillance, but from Filips - for assault, the use of illegal weapons and the creation of emotional stress.
Trump's representative Houp Hikes did not immediately comment.
You have not been able to contact Philip.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Philip has recently left the campaign.
Nor has he been able to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consulting Services".

A new tradition - festivals of paganism and sport in <0xC4><0xB6><0xC4><0xBC><0xC4><0xBC>ciem.
On Saturday in Ku<0xC4><0xBC>cie for the first time the people gathered for the holidays and sports.
After ten years of celebration, this time it was decided that the feast of Ezer will be no more.
The new page has now been rescheduled.
The day started with sports competitions.
This time the competition was not in the traditional ways and too serious to take, because, for example, the shooters had to throw a sleeping target, the shoe flew, with the man's left hand city, the "bumping" was not at all in any Olympic games.
However, each participant was able to show just how strong, brave, agile and resilient he is.
After the sports games, everyone gathered in the outdoor arena, where the festivities began.
At the same time, there was also a "children's corner", where little ones could get lost in breathtaking attractions and get a new image in the makeup salon.
The news, which could also become a tradition, was a truck debt, which went both tractors and motorcycles.
Inga Kadi<0xC4><0xB7>e-Skadi<0xC5><0x86>a, head of the Ku<0xC4><0xBC><0xC4><0xBC>ciem parish administration, who wanted a nice rest and dry weather, spoke to everyone, but the rain did not bother much.
The celebration continued with the greeting of the youngest inhabitants of <0xC4><0xB6><0xC4><0xBC><0xC4><0xBC>ciem.
It is really good that the parish has been supplemented with five girls and one boy.
With the performances at the k<0xC5><0xAB><0xC5><0xAB><0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0xAB>m<0xC4><0xAB>rs came amateur art collective from Engure district - the spectators very liked the performances of the senior dance group "Ruden's rhythms", various folk dance performers "Reds" and young dancers "Yellow Pearls".
And it doesn’t matter that on the wet stage it also happened to slip.
Of course, the famous actor duo J<0xC4><0x81>nis Jar<0xC4><0x81>ns and Dainis Porgants, who were again Mildi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> Nabi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> and S<0xC4><0x81>vidr<0xC4><0xAB>te Kr<0xC4><0x81>ni<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, as well as the attractive wife of B<0xC4><0x93>rzciem from the fishermen's village "Dien<0xC4><0xAB>na".
The ball was played by the group "Bru<0xC4><0x9F>is".
The United Kingdom needs to maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Hytrova will not only promote prosperity and growth in the local regions and in London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Heathrow very attractive, as in 2012 in London, where we invested a huge amount of work so that all the national regions would be the beneficiaries of the Olympic Games.
Stratford and <0xC3><0x86>stenda have won an enormous amount of the Olympic Games.
And we will do it again, by providing local residents and businesses with business opportunities close to Hytrov.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally add a point to youth unemployment in the Hytrov area.
Like at the 2012 London Olympics, there will also be people this time who will think that this challenge is too big and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At the time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympic Games and that it would be a world-wide extinction.
Skeptics were wrong about 2012 and also in the case of Hytrov they will not be right.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Hytrov has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Hytrov is an infrastructure project that will benefit the whole society, not individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating the ground for both employment and experience at this airport and across the UK.
A great team is working at Heathrow, which has created a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment programme, including in time and budget starting with Terminal 5, which five years from the place has been named as the best airport terminal in the world and finally has a two-way terminal 2.
Now they are ready to set up a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics have been a great success, and I am sure that this will be the case with the expansion of Heathrow.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, ensuring our trade future and creating a new employment environment that Britain could be proud of.
Lords Pols Deitons is a member of the Board of Directors of Hytrov and a former Secretary of Commerce of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman climbs the highway, trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, he stumbles on the highway.
Police are trying to find witnesses to the incident, when she was transported by several cars early Thursday morning on the highway to her.
The accident occurred on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the city of Morges in the canton of Vo.
Vo canton police report said that in a desperate attempt to commit suicide, the woman had mastered the road in the dark, where she was driven by several machines.
Unsurprisingly trying to kill themselves, the victims, 49-year-old Swiss, broke into several machines, including a heavy machine.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the accident have already testified, but others involved have not yet been identified, says the police, which calls for the recall of the drivers involved and witnesses of the accident.
A criminal investigation has also been initiated in the case, which in this case is a logical step, the lawyer Gilles Hofstellers referred to Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Is it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofstellers adds: "That's a clear prosecutor."
Two similar cases, which have occurred in the last 5 years, indicate that none of the drivers will be called to account.
In both cases, the pedestrian in the middle of the night had gone to the highway, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that the night in the middle of the highway will be the pedestrian, the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was executed for negligence when she drove a man who was lying on the A1 road near Paijerne in the middle of the night in August 2014.
The court found that the 22-year-old victim was drunk and later noticed that he was sleeping on the road.
The court concluded that the policeman, who was on his way to the scene of the accident, travelled in a manner appropriate to the circumstances, and the judge acknowledged that the man lying on the road was "a completely unexpected and extraordinary case".
Anyone who has information about a Thursday incident near Morges is invited to contact the police by phone on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
On the Internet, signatures are collected for the holding of a new VID-leadership contest.
On the petition portal "Avaaz.org" began the collection of signatures for the holding of a contest of the head of the new State Revenue Service (VID).
The petition, addressed to the ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Greens and Farmers’ Association (ZZS), states that the company wants a transparent and professional process of appointing officials.
The petition was created on 10 August and is currently signed by 55 people.
The process of appointing VID Director General Ingas Kol<0xC4><0xBC>egova is opaque and unprofessional.
It recalls the best traditions of the officials of the Soviet Union.
This discredits public administration and, once again, makes the public hope in government and politicians.
"There is a need for a contest with clear criteria against which all candidates should be assessed," the petition text reads.
Its author, J<0xC4><0x81>nis B., pointed out that the public does not know the criteria for Kol<0xC4><0xBC>egov’s chosen position.
Also, it is not clear what the candidate's intentions in the work of the VID are.
The petition states that the State Chancellery should set up a new, open competition in which professional candidates are actively addressed, staffing specialists are drawn up and a corresponding remuneration is offered.
Last week, Finance Minister Dana Reiznieces-Ozola officially appointed the head of the Kol<0xC4><0xBC>egov VID, this week the government was scheduled to approve him in the new position, but all the party's "Unity" ministers voted against, so the issue of the week was postponed.
Samoilov: If we lost, then I played badly.
Beach volleyball players Aleksandrs Samoilov and J<0xC4><0x81>nis <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> hoped for a prize at the Riode<0xC5><0xBE>aneiro Olympic Games, however, without touching it, there is no difference in the place where the competition is concluded, after leaving the tournament, Samoilovs showed.
One of the most powerful beach volleyball pairs in the world on Thursday in the final and decisive game of the sub-group tournament with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost to the Brazilians Evandru Gonsalve<0xC5><0xA1>a Oliveir and Pedro Solberga Salgad, finishing the game in half.
In the three sub-group matches, Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same relationship was for two more pairs.
In the continuation, the ratio of three pairs of small points to each other was counted, which, after this cat's convincing loss in the road, was the most unfavorable one for the Latvian duet.
"In the first set we were in the lead, but from 16:15 we also stayed on 16 points," recalled <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
I don't even know how we're missing points in the rest of the set.
You can't play it.
After that, in the second set everything was fine and at the end of the set managed to break the game, in addition, it had to be a good basis for the third set as well.
We started out the same way, but after we switched sides, the result grew to just one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup all teams were similar, almost all matches had three sets, so small points were important.
"You had to play more similar, not give 3-4 points in a row several times," said the athlete.
We knew that Evandru could be saved.
"In the first set we met with it at the end, in the second we scored 1-2 points, but in the third at +4 he already left the game," recalled <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
We tried to show the best game.
Sometimes it happened, sometimes it didn’t.
The overall assessment situation was not considered before the match, but it was known that more small points were needed as much as possible.
"If we lost, then I played badly," Samoilovs said.
We were expecting a good service from Evandru, and with that in the first set we also had quite a good finish, but in the third he opened a service and it was difficult to form an attack.
In turn, I made a lot of mistakes right at Peter’s service, but that had to be done.
Samoilov said that, contrary to the previous sword, athletes today had no nervousness.
"We went, we played, there was also protection, but we needed better reception of the service," said the athlete.
"They played well and at the end of the day they got to the "urra".
Before the tournament, we immediately said that the draw is the most uncomfortable it could have been.
We had the chance to fight for the first place as well, but we didn’t even get out of the group.
"All of us were waiting for the medal and also we are from ourselves, but after that there is no difference - 25th place or fourth," said Samoilov, who predicted that the duo will continue to play together in the future.
I think that there will be no issue and we will continue to play together, because this is only one tournament.
Samoilovam Riode<0xC5><0xBE>aneiro was already in his third Olympic career, as he started in 2008 in Beijing with Martina P<0xC4><0x83>v<0xC4><0x83>vina, but four years ago in London he played with Ruslan Sorokin.
This was the second start for <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> at the Olympics.
"Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
The state energy company "Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market from both the position of the consumer and potential trader, said Ivita Bidere, the company's press secretary.
"The decision on whether to join the Latvenergo gas market as a trader in the future will determine which model of the gas market and the legal framework will be established."
"For this reason, we are actively involved in the creation and commenting of legislation, as well as submitting our proposals," Bidere said.
The agency BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economy (EM) in cooperation with the Public Services Regulatory Commission and the energy company "Latvijas G<0xC4><0x81>ze" has developed the draft rules of the Cabinet of Ministers "The rules of trade and use of natural gas" which will change the principles of trade in existing nature.
When working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the objective of the EM is to make the natural gas trading process as simple as possible and understandable to the user.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution, the "traitor's central model" is chosen, in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice and one information provisioning and distribution of customer services.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the electricity trade.
It should be noted that the gradual opening of the market for domestic users - even after 3 April 2017 those domestic users who do not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader as regulated.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader," the ministry said.
On the other hand, traders will have to choose a natural gas trader with whom to conclude a natural gas trade agreement.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trade agreement, a certain period of time for traders of the natural gas trade will be provided by the current natural gas trader at its fixed price.
The draft regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules lay down the procedure for the supply of natural gas to the users of the pipeline and the supply of the pipeline, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the owner of the pipeline, the rights and obligations of the pipeline

Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens and Farmers’ Union (ZU)) next week plans to speak with Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ri Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inski (ZU) and government coalition partners about increasing the salary of the Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID).

The Minister also stressed that she has no idea of a specific candidate to speak out for the vacancy.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed the opinion that the head of the State Environmental Service Inga Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova would have been a good Director General of the VID.
On the other hand, with regard to Daci Pel<0xC4><0x97>ko, who has expressed his readiness to apply for this position, the Minister reiterated the view that the new Director-General of the VID should have a "view from the side" and should not have to come from the VID.

In the application, she showed that it is not an easy choice, but in the last two weeks her relatives have experienced serious emotional pressure, although she has not done any legal action.
Kol<0xC4><0xBC>egova also pointed out that the discussion of her candidacy has increased the conflict between the ruling coalition parties, which is also not acceptable.
It has also been reported that the former Director General of VID In<0xC4><0x81>ra P<0xC4><0x93>tersone left office at the end of June.

As a result, the company did not have sufficient funds to purchase cheaper raw materials in large quantities and receive a volume discount.
The withdrawal of the relevant bank from the Latvian market also led the company to implement projects of support from the European Union Structural Funds, which would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and modernise the infrastructure.
Similarly, the rise in the price of raw materials and the unwillingness of customers to pay more for the products produced by the company had a negative impact on the financial creators of the company in the previous year.

The new product will increase its turnover by about 300 thousand euros per month", says the company's management.
In August 2016, the company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish production to Iraq.
The Blue Lagoon has sent the first experimental container to Israel in 2016, expanded the launch market to Cyprus and this September will sign a cooperation agreement with the new supermarket chain in the USA.

Z<0xC4><0x81>ras Lender’s accommodation at the cemetery of Rutas, who was a Swedish ambassador to Latvia, was fortunately evaluated in Riga in 1924, because it was she who revealed to the woman Z<0xC4><0x81>ras Lenderes an unusual low counter, which she tried when debuting on the theatre stage in the Riga cabaret.
Perhaps it was just an accident in Riga that turned into a lucky turn on the creative path of Z<0xC4><0x81>ras against the world’s fame.
R<0xC4><0xAB>ga Z<0xC4><0x81>rai Leander was associated with warm memories, and she hoped to return to Riga in the guest shows, but unfortunately these hopes were not decided to be fulfilled, because World War II began.

Due to the repair of the neighbor, the man is at the collapsed ceilings and forced to leave the house.
In the LTV broadcast "4th studio" Dmitry Saidyashev, whose neighbor started the capital repair in his apartment, and since then Dmitry is out of the ceiling of the apartment and is not sure that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors have done a voluntary construction and the ceilings have been damaged in my apartment.
Then I informed the building authorities of Riga, the house managers and other organizations.
The Administration said that we are not an operational service and we do not have any expert.
“The owner of the apartment must go to the Latvian Association of Engineers, and from there will be an expert,” says Dmitry.
The invited expert came, recorded what had happened and acknowledged that the cover was in an unsatisfactory condition.
However, a month has passed since the first Dmitry’s application to the building board, and until the beginning of this week, no one has been able to answer whether the location in the apartment is not life-threatening.
The government said - this is legislation, wait, if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in a row.
“Then I wrote to the Riga court, but they transferred the house to the manager, then the manager of the house again to the building manager, and then there is a dead end,” says Dmitry.
After examining the whole pile of paper, it is clear that the construction work is stopped, although at any moment it can be heard that someone is working there.
Within two more months of being must carry out an expert examination and within six months the owner of the apartment, who is carrying out repair work, all these defects in being must be eliminated.
The independent expert has drawn up an opinion, but the building authorities consider it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal inlay in this supporting structure is affected, therefore there is no assurance that the owner of the lower apartment is in danger.
“That’s why we have asked for an additional explanation from this expert,” says Ilze <0xC5><0xBD><0xC5><0xAB>ka, a representative of the city’s construction department in Riga.
Despite the prohibition to carry out any repair work in the upper apartment, it remains to be heard that the construction will continue.
The penalty for voluntary construction without a building permit is from 70 to 700 euros, but in a particular case the penalty can be significantly heavier.
While the expert opinion is awaited, the building authorities have decided that both apartments should not be operated - both in the construction works and in the apartment of Dmitry.
"This is not the case in the case of the building administration in which, in this way, due to their ignorance or simply unwillingness, the residents may have created a threat not only to their property, but also to the owner of the inferior property, as a result of which this owner cannot be in possession of his property",
Now Dmitrija has to look for another place to live - at the wheel, friends, hotel or rent another apartment.
But the resulting losses Dmitry can try to recover from the neighbor's civil court, which, though, can take a very long time.
Because of the voluntary construction, it is currently forbidden to stay in both apartments until the builder gives his conclusion, and it can be expected even for three weeks.
The resulting losses will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment in which the repair work took place.
The owner of this apartment, because the building authorities did not take into account, is also at risk of imprisonment for a period of up to six months.

The transformation of the former Kemer sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost 22 million euros.
The transformation of the former <0xC4><0xB6>emeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" will cost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>22 million, LETA tells the agency of the manager of the upcoming hotel SIA "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" Gita <0xC5><0xBD>elve.
The establishment of the hotel is the first phase of the restoration of the former sanatorium of Kemer.
The second phase will be the wellness or wellness clinic, which is scheduled to open in 2022, while the hotel is scheduled to open in May 2018.
<0xC5><0xBD>elve notes that the exact cost of the clinic is not yet known.
However, she points out that it will be located in the building of the former Kemer Resort Polyclinic, which covers an area of about 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri and the owner of the proposed clinic is the international fund G Capital Europe, which invests in European assets.
The owners of G Capital Europe are several investors who invest money in this fund, <0xC5><0xBD>elve points out.
As previously stated by G Capital Europe Executive Director Georges Jones, the former resort polyclinic is planned to invest between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 million, total investment amounting to over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
In the case of the restoration of the cultural historical park, there are more than 42 hectares of land in the village, in the case of the restoration of the road and road sections, in the construction of an interactive natural tourism facility, in the improvement of the territory and in the construction of a parking lot in the village of J<0xC4><0xAB>l<0xC4><0xAB>la Darzi<0xC5><0x86>a, in the village of J<0xC4><0xAB>l<0xC4><0xAB>l<0xC4><0x81>s<0xC4><0xAB>s<0xC4><0xAB>s<0xC4><0xAB>s<0xC4><0xAB>s<0xC4><0xAB>
By the middle of 2017, the design works are planned, but the construction work and the arrangement work will begin in the autumn of next year.
As reported, the historic sanatorium complex "Kemeri" is planned to build a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Kemeri" and "wellness" or wellness clinic.
However, the reconstruction is long.
In contrast, the 2010 report also stated that Ominasis regularly communicates with the hotel operator "Kempinski", who continues to provide daily technical control in the sanatorium "Kemeri", and already in 2011 is going to "finished the "Kemeri" in the future hotel "Kemeri"
In October 2014, at the auction of the property of the Khmer sanatorium belonging to the insolvent "Ominasis Latvia" confirmed "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri", but a month later the auction was recognized as non-occurrence, as the winner was not paid for the prize at the specified time.
The selling price was determined according to the starting price of the last non-occurring auction - EUR 2.86 million.
As the agency LETA informed the representative of the city court Ieva Aile, the municipality, by signing the protocol, confirmed that with the support of the co-financing of the European Union Structural Funds, the infrastructure available - the restoration of the historic Kemeru car park, the construction of the car park
The President will give the order of the Three Stars to the opera producer Antonenko.
President Raimonds Vejonis will next week, on 16 August, give the order of the Three Star Order to Alexander Antonenko, the third-class opera producer of the order, according to the President's agenda.
The ceremony to give the order of the three stars will take place at the house of the Blackwells at 13 o’clock.
As evidenced by the information provided by the Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB), Antonenko graduated from J<0xC4><0x81>zep Medi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> Music College in 1998, where he learned how to play percussion instruments and learned singing at Margaritas Gruzdevas.
He studied at the Vocal Department of the J<0xC4><0x81>zep V<0xC4><0xAB>tola Latvian Academy of Music in the Arv<0xC4><0xAB>da Luste class.
In 1997 he began singing in the choir of the Latvian National Opera, but in 1998 he made his debut with the role of Oberto in G.F.Hendel's opera "Al<0xC4><0x8D><0xC4><0xAB>na".
He received the "Great Music Award 2003" for vocal performance in opera performances and Verdi in Requiem.
It is noted that in the 2004/2005 season became the most internationally recognized tenor of Latvia, which employs the largest opera houses in the world.
Since autumn 2004, he has been singing "Dieseldorf's Deutsche Oper am Rhein", in Berlin and Graz, in Dresden's Semperoper, in Oslo and Stockholm's Royal Opera, in London's Covent Garden, in Monte Carlo, in Vienna's State Opera, in Geneva, in Dresden and in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf.
In 2009, Antonenko made his debut with great success in Metropolitan Opera in the role of Prince "Nara".
In 2011, Antonenko and Ricardo Muti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra sang the title "Otello" in the Paris Opera, in the Covent Garden opera he sang Luigi "Apmet<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>a" in the new studio, as well as in Stockholm participated in the recording of "Meet" by Kristofa Loja.
A year later, Antonenko sang with great success the role of Otello in the opera Covent Garden of London.
Former NATO commander Br<0xC4><0xAB>dlov’s e-mail has been hacked by Russian hackers.
Hackers who hacked the computers of the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC) may have committed several other cyberattacks, also hacked the servers of former NATO European Force Commander Filipa Br<0xC4><0xAB>dlova and George Soros Institute's "Open Society" business on Thursday
The information obtained by the hacker was published on DCLeaks.com.
Among other things, there is also a list of Br<0xC4><0xAB>dlova and news about the work of the Soros Institute.
For hackers, computers have been available for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber-attacks were carried out by the same hackers linked to Russian specienists who hacked DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal, in turn, reports that the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama is currently considering the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia, thus responding to the DNC computer hacking.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have official cyber-attacks on the Democratic Party’s servers, which must be blamed by hackers backed by Russia or the Russian authorities.
As reported, the website "WikiLeaks" in July published about 20,000 e-mails, which had been obtained from the DNC computer system and from which it is clear that the leaders of the Democratic Party tried to harm the late party candidate Hillary Clinton's old-fashioned scene.
As reported by U.S. press sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducts an investigation into the hacking of democratic servers, as well as other U.S. specienists believe that Russia’s link to cyberattacks is beyond doubt.
The presence of Joko Ono has threatened "The Beatles".
Paul McCartney acknowledged that the presence of Joko Ono created a sense of danger for the legendary group The Beatles.
The 74-year-old star currently maintains a "good" relationship with the villain John Lennon, but at a time when she went to arrest the group in a recording studio, McCartney was afraid of her because Ono was the only female member of the group - George Harrison and Ringo.
When asked by the singer about both relationships, he told Rolling Stone magazine: "They're really good."
We felt threatened at the time.
While we were recording, she sat on the amplifiers.
The majority of the groups could not endure it.
We were able to do this, but not quite successful, because we were very stressed.
We were not sexists, but girls usually did not go to the recording studio, she allowed us to work.
When John started dating Joko, she wasn't sitting in the control room, but in the middle of our four.
The author of the plot "Yellow Submarine" also admitted that he now regularly communicates with the former band members Ringo, and from time to time confirms the plans of the recording studio "Apple", but otherwise "The Beatles" is "finished working".
Asked if he was still dating another member of the legendary rock band, McCartney told Rolling Stone magazine: "Often not."
We meet at social events and at parties.
However, I do not attend meetings, I feel a bit out of it.
I went from Apple during a severe divorce.
Instead, I sent John the Baptist to meetings and said, "Tell me what everyone says, because I can't stand sitting at its table."
It was too painful, as if you saw your pet die.
The company now works in such a way that I will just listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a habitable planet
Based on NASA’s latest climate models, Venus has once been a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA’s Godard Space Research Institute have developed models to explore the history of Venus using tools and algorithms that are also used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether on Venus, the surface of which is hot, where there is no water and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, which has once been Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have already stated in the past that the slow turning speed of Venus is explained by a dense atmosphere.
However, the latest simulations show that Venus was once flat, Earth-like atmosphere and it has been slowly cut.
The model also looks at the earliest topography of Venus.
There was more dry area on the planet than on the Earth, but there was enough water and geographical diversity on it to be able to form life and not allow water to evaporate.
In the early days of Venus, the Sun was about 30 percent brighter.
In the simulation of the GISS model, the Venus spin model reveals that the light part of the day lasts for 2 months, explained in the press release of the GISS scientist Antony Del Genio.
This process heats the surface of the planet and causes a thing, which in turn forms layers of thick clouds, which act as a raincoat, protecting the planet from the heat of the sun.
As a result, a moderate climate temperature is formed, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although it was once habitable, over the course of several billion years Venus has been subjected to too much heat and ultraviolet rays.
Its oceans were stretched out, and the longitudes were lit by ultraviolet rays.
When the water was completely drained, all that was left was a flat atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas - Venus, as we know it today.
The scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from the position of coach of Avalanche
On Thursday, Colorado coach "Avalanche" and vice president of hockey operations Patrik Rojs made a request to mention the insufficient impact on the team's decision-making process.
Colorado Vice President and General Manager Joe Sakiks confirmed this news and informed that the club will immediately start looking for new coaches.
"For the past three years, I have been energetically, passionately and purposefully fulfilling my duties as head coach and vice president of the Colorado club's hockey operation," Roys, 50, said in a statement.
During this summer, I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve the performance of the team in order to give it the brightness it needs and achieve higher level results.
To achieve this, the Visions of the Vice-President of the Principal Coach and Hockey Operations must be fully aligned with the Visions of the Organization.
He must also be able to influence decisions relating to the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently being met.
Sakiks, who signed up for Roja on 23 May 2013, thanked Roja for his contribution to the team.
Sakiks said that Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate all that he has done for the good of the organization and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the league's best coach and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the knockout games, the Colorado team won the Minnesota hockey team. Since then, the club has not entered the knockout games for two years.
"Avalanche" ended the 2015-2016 season with a result of 39-39-4 and left five points behind "Wild" teams, without obtaining the second special invitation of the organizers of the Western Conference.
In his career, he has won four Stanley Cups - two with Montreal's "Canadian" and two with Avalanche.
Workers of the North Sea oil platform resume talks and lay off strike
Workers' strikes on the remuneration of workers on the North Sea oil platforms have been postponed, as the two parties involved in the dispute have resumed negotiations, the leaders of the message negotiations.
Periodically, a strike is carried out against the oil processing company "Wood Group" on the North Sea oil platforms operated by the company "Royal Dutch Shell".
The joint statement stated that Wood Group and Unite and RMT had agreed to resume negotiations on the settlement of the dispute.
A number of full-day meetings are planned over the coming weeks, starting at the beginning of next week with the aim of re-examination of problematic issues.
Trade unions indicated that their recent measures, organised after a break of more than 25 years, are aimed at a planned reduction of 30 per cent in wages.
This year, due to negative market pressure, Wood Group reduced wages for those working in the North Sea by 9 percent.
As early as 2014, the company reduced the wages of ground workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that the additional wage reductions would allow the company to survive the market declines.
Shell, on the other hand, has already cut salaries for several thousand people and announced plans to discontinue oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries in order to optimize its work by preparing a large-scale merger deal with British energy company Group B.
Energy companies feel pressured by falling oil prices, and the situation is much more complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, Scottish MEP David Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the plans for the North Sea strike.
He said that the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy from which everyone, not individual, will benefit.
In 2016, almost $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea, compared to $7 billion invested in the last five years.
Kepler measured the rotational speed of the stars in the Pleiadian star.
The newest Kepler telescope mission has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalogue of the speed of the stars in the Pleiadian star.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in this star are spinning at different speeds, as well as how the speed of the stars is related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will get more information about the relationship between the mass, age, and even the history of the solar system," said Pasadena's Caltech Infrasarcano Process and Analytical.
The Pleiadian star is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in this star are only beginning to grow, reaching about 125 million years old.
They are rotated at the maximum speed.
Turning at the maximum speed, these growing stars emit a large amount of star wind.
When the winds come in the magnetic field of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the stars age, their speed of rotation decreases.
Kepler measures the speed of each star's rotation by determining the time between the recognizable area of the star, such as the solar plane, the appearance.
The latest star-turning speed catalogue shows that larger stars are spinning at a slower rate than smaller stars.
Rebuls compares the stars to the dancers, the larger growers perform pirouettes more slowly than the smaller growers.
Rebuls tells that in the "ballet" of the Pleiades it is seen that the slow-moving objects are larger and more massive, while the faster-moving objects are very small stars.
Due to the fact that the Pleiadian star is so close, it serves as an excellent space laboratory where you can compare the characteristics of the stars with the speed of rotation.
Rebuls says that the Pleiadian star helps to form theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions of both older and newer stars.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why the speed of the stars' rotation slows down and about the complete stop process.
Rebuls and his colleagues introduced in detail the analysis of the rotational speed of Pleiades stars in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
