Of thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.
Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them; for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and do kindness unto the thousands of them that love me, and keep my statutes.
You shall not speak against a false witness against your neighbor.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

Do not steal.
Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh the name of the LORD thy God in vain.
