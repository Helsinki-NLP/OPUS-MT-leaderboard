The Prague Stock Exchange finished with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions in <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached approximately half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of trading Tuesday, reacted immediately to Monday’s fall when it dropped to approximately 6%.
The fall this time is due to the fall in Wall Street stocks.
Here, too, is the market reaction to the outcome of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which refused to support the Secretary of the Financial Sector's stabilization plan.
The fall of stocks in Asia
Stocks in the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although over the course of the day the index finally scuttled some of the losses.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Stock Index throughout its financial day marked nearly four percent, although it later mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following Chinese stock movements on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, while in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the index’s secretary, fell to 3.6 percent.
“The rescue actions scheduled in the U.S. are unsafe and this influences the financial market around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should reconvene as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody Bath of American Actions
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the financial system assistance plan to which $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion crowns) should be devoted.
The lawmakers, in this way, ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloody bath and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to nearly seven percent, a similar volume drop last recorded in 1987.
The index went down before it was announced, but as soon as it was shown that the Assembly proposal did not go forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress Withdraws: U.S. Government May Inject $700 Billion into Bank
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a broad-based pact of financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers caused a gap in the talks over the approval of the bailout plan in its form of aid to the U.S. financial system with the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen should fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make the final form of the law public and be voted on.
The financial system assistance plan will be discussed on Monday in the House of Representatives.
He told Reuters on Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and the Assembly Bank.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the bailout plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, “disappointment” will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms whose market aid will also be achieved in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a great advance.
We have resolved our discrepancies with regard to the way the package of measures should have for market stabilization," Democrat Nancy Pelosi<0xC3><0xA1> told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the lawmakers met on Sunday night with the finance minister, Henry Paulson, to give a definitive form to the government fund.
It should buy from financial companies unsold mortgage assets that lead financial companies to hard losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective in the market.
It’s still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we’re already in it,” Paulson said.
A Sign for Asian Businesses
The global financial crisis specifically affects the fast-moving stock market.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing everything they can to get Congress to finalize a deal on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors’ business in the face of the Asian financial market as these are the ones that are in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday’s trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear for sure about when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote, and even if they don’t stagnate at the last moment with any problems.
Legislators believe it will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, which would be another $100 billion and later the last $350 billion.
Bush Appreciate the Advancement of Meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can override its veto by a majority vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to earn financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgages whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying off their mortgages.
“We have worked everything.
The House of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is pleased with Saturday’s progress and that he appreciates “both parties’ commitment to stabilizing our financial market and protecting our economy.”
Limitation of the armored contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, head of negotiators, said lawmakers had decided on the responsibility of the program’s money for protecting taxpayers’ taxes from their losses, a relief to the planned financial plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armored contracts for directors of the participating companies of the program, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This should be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on it, and we’ve made great progress towards a deal that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes helping homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree to the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly charges of payments on debtors’ terms and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
“And that’s why we don’t know with what mechanism and at what price problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not as relevant, according to Marek.
“Much more important is that, already this week, Congressmen agree on their support and give their good-bye as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement that that approval is reached is, at the moment, the most important thing,” Marek insisted.
Armed struggle: the MP3 player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost all mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Yet there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the player.
The choice practically depends on the way it is used and the requirement of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for him to acquire the most modern record to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album on it.
On the other hand, this type of music products such as LP discs no longer come out, and in terms of their quality there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records with art rock, jazz, or blues music are tucked into your shelves, you’re probably dreaming, at least, of this type of record.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, that is, the compressed, simplified music - the music in MP3.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns on a player, as well as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly test the twenty-crown merchant helmets.
Two ends, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also determines the battery life
Some of the best players get a lot more than just playing music and even what not even most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Faced with the most basic features like calling, messaging, you can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera and even get to navigate.
And when we take into account the Smartphone and the PDAs will have in their pocket also a small computer.
This is a small miracle as no refrigerator knows how to make a grill and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobile also brings us disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the sooner the screen indicator will be lit asking to be recharged.
And the reproduction of music is one of the biggest energy tragons.
Few are the mobiles that can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) clearly have a higher performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap phones will not play for more than two hours.
If in addition to this, above, they constantly call for still, for more safety, a charger for work - this is also true for the more expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem is not going to have, as even the worst ones last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when you record music on your mobile.
Unfortunately only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, moreover, not all of them can connect directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some non-reduction reader units can connect the small memory cards that are used on the mobiles.
In the players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Simply fill the device with music via the computer's USB.
Most mobiles and players create their own order in the music library according to the name of the performer, album title, genre or also according to user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment you are interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and are going to listen to it every day for just a while, like on the tram, then it is enough with any mobile that you play.
That's what virtually any mobile really gets.
It should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player plays the music.
The MP3 plays it all and almost all the music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and with the exception of it the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by Apple and its iPod).
The best mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough through the mobile internet to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could by itself be a weighty argument to acquire a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and most are limited only to the fleeting success themes of the radios.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (either by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a mobile phone on top of it.
Whenever you want to hear something, you’ll find the phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry with you headphones or, at least, handsfree ones.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile even if it is at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobile with music will be its price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited by the absence of an entry for classic headphones.
The best, even in terms of the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5mm input for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing more than their easy service.
The simplest players – by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) – are really managed by anyone.
The minimum functions, its handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the tocadiscs is evident.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, gigantic counts for data loss.
What device to choose
Even the cheapest phones (e.g., the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card will reach the two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped with only a 2 GB card with maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive ones have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, check out Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to the capacity (maximum 2 GB) it is not necessary to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are considered one of the most demanding music lovers, shake hands with the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman line have almost identical use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over the four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the aforementioned brand brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all the services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not going to take long to arrive.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it on mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is among the most expensive in the entire Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming rates is likely to arrive at a paradoxical situation – for some customers of Czech mobile operators the SMS they send from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that you really want to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, as we have three mobile networks and its high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, President of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), also said that there is no longer a place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classical operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be quite difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market that brought a sharp drop in prices to which the classical operators had to react.
At the same time, even before sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is room for this type of operators and that they can be successful.
You don’t have to look too far for examples.
In February this year we inform you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator managed to get more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, behind Mobilking is the Penta group which, in addition, is the owner of U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order for them to function effectively, they only need a lot less customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry with them relatively large expenses in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, this type of virtual operators usually profile themselves with low costs - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that however often counteract the offer of more adjusted services.
Thus, for example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheap as compared to the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good hit to bet on a trivial nothing target group.
This operator is directed specifically to the man.
“The right man chooses Mobilking – it’s the operator he likes and who he can rely on,” says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works with this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept as Poland could engage in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: “The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the offer of services it is relatively saturated"
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it’s about the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region,” Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the Penta financial group, said in a telephone conversation for mobil.cz.
He indirectly assured that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic definitely did not bow to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything possible so that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator already shows the GTS Novara group that would like to take a step further to become a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, in order to offer our customers not only fixed telephone services but also mobile telephone services.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have met repeatedly with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have made progress in the meetings,” said the group’s spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
So, maybe they're flashing better times.
It seems that, according to unofficial information, the first official operator would probably have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment we believe that the situation is suitable for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
To date, no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this area,” Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, spokesman for Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2, told mobil.cz.
Other operators refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokesman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1>, in exceptional compliance with O2’s opinion, adds: “To date, we have not registered any viable commercial projects that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to develop.”
“On the T-Mobile network, it will be difficult to find any virtual operator by the end of the year.
At this time we should already have on the table some concrete contract that would be possible to study in such a short time frame."
Vodafone directs its attention rather to meeting the own requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of cost and infrastructure allocation.
We regard it as the greatest contribution from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this field lies in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on mobile.”
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a drop in prices and thereby a decrease in profits.
So why make it easier to enter the competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull from the same rope, proof of this is the grab when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was at the time of the entry of U:fon by the T-Mobile company.
This is evidenced by the public information accessible on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> websites.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> adds: “Furthermore, not long ago the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was open to a fourth operator.
As far as the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is concerned, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would pose great demands for him and, above all, for his services."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>TU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Bids (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
However, it expressed its typical stance on this issue.
“The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after an agreement was concluded on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator.
To date, no agreement has been concluded as the offer of potential stakeholders was rather not interesting enough for classical operators,” added Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa, from the UOHS Department of Foreign Affairs.
These statements did not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For offices that must represent the interests of consumers it is more than a consideration, apart from this they must observe that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "In abroad where virtual operators work normally we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the price drop of mobile phone services"
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market media and the price drop do not fall within the interest of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
The really shocking thing in all of this is the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in petrol stations because it is clear that it is a work of chance and a hard struggle for competition.
"The Office in this regard has found no signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position therefore they do not have a corresponding rise in liability in their actions on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecommunications regulators,” Chalupa added.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many conflicting points.
Obviously, there is a relevant market analysis drawn up by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial tendering as a single market.
In this type of market of course none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another view - in order for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all its logic - has the monopoly of its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument is not accepted, at least for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS should represent a warning to the fact that three mobile operators rise remarkably similarly.
The current complaints of the interested parties (including the aforementioned GTS Novera company) show that in all negotiations with the operators they clash with many similar impediments.
Carrying responsibility in <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes its hands in all this matter.
We have met with him in similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law for the expansion of <0xC4><0x8C>TU's competition in the field of commercial tenders was recently introduced, even though a number of experts promised that the situation would improve.
This must be perfectly known to the representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS, but it is evident that their interests are elsewhere.
It's all right, when no one looks
At the same time, it still inconspicuously works something like a pseudo-virtual operator that in Czech mobile networks already there are a few.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile phone services that, however, only a part are public.
These are usually companies that are engaged in multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile services.
Usually only a select few get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same by ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that trading conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit this type of resale.
"If cases such as those cited could be found to be a breach of contract conditions that could result in the end of the collaboration with the given society," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> replied to the question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity carried out by mobile operators would not reach people responsible.
It is precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned that they can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they get no negligible profits and at the same time – unlike authentic virtual operators – in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns us of possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible so many percent of customers.
These, in addition, must accept that your phone’s SIM card is not in your name so they can’t absolutely dispose of it as a normal carrier customer.”
This is exactly what the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> should look like.
In addition, a new question appears for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators surround the eyes in this type of procedure, why do they block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has enough competence to discover this type of activities and if you do not want it you should not be satisfied with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this story and that their trading conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As already made clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant drop in the prices of services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where the virtual operator emerged, the classical operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this disruption.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulators have intervened and in none of the cases defended operators but their customers.
Whether it was with formal measures or informal pressure, the first virtual operator emerged and with it began to emerge more.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body all this case happens as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we can not fail to be impressed that the confusion of the attributions in these cases suits them.
But let's not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator actually arrives at these lands, then the Czech mobile market is likely to start moving again.
If any of the operators let a virtual mobile operator enter it will be difficult for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling it more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek on the occasion of the official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, my home.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one male and one female voice, one with Chorus and another instrumental.
From the canto, Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka are in charge.
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers this Czech national anthem as one of the most beautiful hymns.
Czech Radio said earlier that it intentionally chose for solo singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
“From the beginning I have tried with the two and then, also, with the Chorus that would be fixed in the dictionary so that the text would be well understood, so that it would be consonant,” he said.
The official Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, My Home first sounded in 1834 on the boards of the State Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl and arranged with the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It gained popularity and people made it theirs.
The first stanza of the song after the rise of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The Prague MHD takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company the date when the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can currently be purchased by nearly one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously upload it to their chip card at the info centers and stations of the transport company at the metro stations, Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Rozly.
The bonds can be purchased from yesterday on the internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce can definitely start to forget about the ticket offices at the metro stations, where until now they had to regularly queue up to get a normal ticket.
The bonus is purchased on the Internet, and the Opencard card will be reloaded to one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is available to passengers a window with prepared staff that helps those interested with the purchase online and also with the reloading of the bonus purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to reload the electronic bonus on the Opencard on the vending machines that are located in some underground vestibules.
How are these vending machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticketing machine and travelers will probably have already fixed on them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
“Now there are five in the city but by the end of the year there would have to be eighty,” Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> said.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will only be charged on it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, on the commuter trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of the localities of Central Bohemia.
“On the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the voucher,” explained the control of the tickets, Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal of the Ropid organization that establishes the schedules of the public transport of Prague.
The circumvalence buses have their reading cards mounted on the driver's cab.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also it is necessary to accompany it with the Opencard in the place intended for this on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonuses there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal said.
Passengers who do not travel on the circumvalence buses and do not remember when the validity of the bonus is over can go to the vending machines where the cards are charged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown information about the validity of your document.
Southeasterners wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
The German Sudeten asked in 1945 that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we can’t be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire, presumably, some German groups from the Sudeten Islands addressed the President of the United States in 1945.
It is the result of the letters that are stored in a particular file and that are today stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "land <0xC5><0xA0>umava" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and we really want his word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators,” the letter reads, signed with a “people who carry the destiny of <0xC5><0xA0>umava in their heart.”
In view of the fact that the union of Czechoslovakia with the South East Germans presumably implies - according to them the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors pray in the letter to the American president who assumes <0xC5><0xA0>umava for today and forever under a protectorate.
“We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million people, it delivers us to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that at all contributes to the victory of the allies,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals from “Czech oppressors.”
If the president of the United States presumably doubts about this idea of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the United States or live under its patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of post-war history, may sound a little childish to us, according to some experts, it vividly paints the expectations of the Germans of the southeast then.
Although the Czech Germans had to insinuate minimally that it was going to be about their expulsion from the republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate for the Sudetenland some clear form of autonomy.
Others believed that they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
This was in the war, as Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice's German, wrapped up in the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war the British captured him and placed him in the Holstein prisoner camp dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that by returning home, the Czech would be fine," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted that on the basis of the Goods Decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
Don't think - pay!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way it could be characterized the emotional Campaign that decided to launch on Wednesday the Ministry of Transport in the media.
The minister’s office, Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, promises to deter drivers from dangerous driving behavior.
The $150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, cinema, the Internet and brochures.
It would have to deter the driver from high-speed and alcohol driving.
And also to remind them that before they get started, the belts are tied.
It wants to get to the awareness especially of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that enliven the emotions.
And for this we are witnessed by the "bloody" ads throughout the campaign:
Don't think - pay!
The word "don't think" is written with big letters in the enrolment.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pays."
This must symbolize that man at a time of desperation can come to pay with his own life.
The ads are going to “fear” viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of victims of accidents can be seen.
It promises to reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements were made by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and Cane for Drivers
“For drivers, the sugar and cane system is worth it.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a traffic light is passed in red and thus saves time.
The whip is threatened by a fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks,” says Na Homolce hospital transport psychologist Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n.
And that’s why an information campaign is needed in the press and mainly negative advertising, the psychologist says.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
“If there is any installed panel warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it,” Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The President of the Provisional Government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, ruled on the restitution of virtually all occupied lands in 1967, that is, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we will necessarily have to return almost all (occupied) land if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
“I’m sure we’ll be left with a bit of a percentage of these lands, but we’ll have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the land of Israel) because without this there won’t be peace,” he added.
He admitted that in case of restitution, this would also include Jerusalem.
“Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore doesn’t want tractors or excavators to go over their legs like one of my best friends did, then will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to the two July attacks in the city where several dead and dozens of people were injured.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find “a special solution for the Temple Hill, a sacred and historic place” that is located inside the ancient city.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he insisted later.
Retirement of the Golan Heights
Olmert also voiced Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also mean concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
“I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan,” he warned.
“The Syrians know well what they will have to take off to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with Hizbullah (Chita Movement), they will have to break away from the permanent support that causes the terrorism of Hamas (Chita Movement), Al Qaeda (Terrorist Network) and Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq.”
Questions after the accident: Is it illegal to hire people on buses?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the company Student Agency near the Italian city of Padua, the question arises whether the passengers and passengers can travel by bus during the trip.
“If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the azafatah is opposed to the road traffic law,” said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old azaphate died last week was obviously caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less secure place of the vehicle despite having booked two other sites.
However, the bus can have an accident or brake suddenly, and at the exact moment the azafat distributes the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the role is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with places on foot.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit.
Student Agency’s long-distance buses have no places to stand, which confirmed the company’s director, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, to Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, this was withdrawn and we reached an agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is in operation if they have a seat,” he told us.
The azaphate does not know the law
"There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the azafatate - no legal provision clears this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term “Vehicle Reviewer,” whose rights and obligations are not defined,” adds spokesman Hanzelka.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, director of the Department of Road Vehicle Traffic at the Ministry of Transport, thinks that the law adequately addresses this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have places on foot.
That's all," he says.
Buses are divided between urban, where there are places to stand and with limited maximum speed, interurban with places to stand with a higher speed permit and those of long distances without places to stand, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with seat belt.
As on the plane, the expert says
The BESIP expert on Transport Safety, Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n, sees no major problems with the movement of the azaphate on the bus.
"During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared with the service on the planes.
Not even here you have the certainty that the turbulences are coming and that the azaphate can be hit in the head."
“However, if the bus suddenly brakes obviously the physical laws are valid.
The same as on an urban bus or on the tram.
The safety of the passenger must be solved by the internal regulations of the carrier," he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers azafatas service.
He employs two hundred people in it.
The director, even after the accident, considers that work risky.
“However, the moment I get the impression that the baiting post is risky, then I will suppress it.
The coffee and newspapers can receive it, the passengers, upon entering.
It would even save costs,” he says.
In the interest of safety is the reason why Asiana lacks azafatas in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We have no hostages, we are against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
There was a huge tragedy.
In the accident of the line connecting Naples a young azafata from Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus without using the intermittents.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, he collided with the right front.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the azafata's rest were sold.
"These sites are not possible to book them for long distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the girl’s family’s compensation but wait for the financial expenses also on the part of the culprit.
Reform of the law?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring greater precision to the movement of the azafatate on the bus in which thirty expert members of a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working for a year.
“However, no concrete conclusion has been reached.
They are not too dedicated to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile during the ride,” says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the passengers to be a significant threat to the safety of passengers,” Hanzelka said, ending that the control of safety on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf's hope rests in Frankfurt
The letter from the board of directors of West LB Bank to its employees does not lack big words.
By merging the units of the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf bank with DEKA bank it is possible to form ‘a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group’, as it says, published on Monday.
The West LB bank, breaking the ‘competition block’ with sustainable profitability would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger may be a start for subsequent mergers in the field of regional banks.
This is how you come to understand the text, when a board wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because like before, the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision which recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalian government that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the part of Frankfurt, there has been much talk about the union of such a kind between DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know for their investment funds, and the West LB.
Indeed, Franz Waas, the head of DEKA bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August revealed that he sees no sense in the bank’s merger, located on Mainzer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e Street, with a regional bank such as the Helaba or the West LB.
But the board of directors of DEKA, which is now made up of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, ordered the board to start negotiations with the West LB on common commercial activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, as they say on the financial site.
This is not the first time when the consolidation in the field of Sparkassen appears the name of DEKA bank, which with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 at one time the situation seemed so that DEKA could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and with Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was left without results.
Only the plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed against Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of the Rhineland-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Merl, the chairman of Helaba’s board of directors, said he was against plans for co-existence with his bank.
Regardless of that, it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
Well, when the Bavarian parliament elections are to be held, BayernLB’s union with the regional bank of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg could make progress.
For Helaba, that’s not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to merge will increase, Helaba will lack partners to do that.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although until now it stood out much better than the financial crisis that the properties of Stuttgart and Munich did.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba, earlier this year avoided plans to co-exist with the West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form only one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank’s own desire.
Thus, also in the letter of the bank’s board of directors it is said that a complete solution would be sought for the entire bank.
As the coexistence of individual parts of the bank can be combined with DEKA, that will show the time.
Oktoberfest's second weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth.
But this time, Elena attends him as his girlfriend, and that’s why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-liter barrel of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge tiger bear showing nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants what low sounds can produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a palmadite, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, this evening at 23:45, three buses leave, <0x60>direction Munich, the party of beer', forecast arrival at 6:30 a.m.
Three buses are planned especially for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are South Americans singing, they had already started to party at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver colored pins, belongs to him these buses.
For five years they have been coming to the Oktoberfest, considering that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 the turn.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the law of purity of Bavaria, sickness insurance and the German-language guide- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the way on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
No beer, not yet.
Quickly tranquility reigns on the bus, travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the forces.
It stops in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian registration take another break on the 8th motorway just before Munich.
Finally, when Marco’s group is due to arrive at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next to the Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the Internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the tent of the campaign open, that means marching!", cries Marco in the morning.
"Walk!" Walk and occupy the back seats in the campaign tent.
“Don’t take the front seats, because we’re going to block, and everyone with yellow caps doesn’t sit on the same bench, spread out over all space!”
One liter of beer, Marco ruge, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
As soon as he gets out of his place, he'll be busy!"
Third: "This afternoon at exactly 10 o'clock you have to get here!" Do you understand?
And now everyone goes to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, touches the yellow hats on the trees, traffic signs and even on a sign of the elections of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest known as "the Italians' weekend"
There is no exact data on the number of people; this is 50,000 people making the trip over the Alps and storming into the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police receive help from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross which makes a statistic of the present nations, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, face the English (about 60 assists) and the Austrians take the first place.
The preferred Italian campaign store is called Hofbr<0xC3><0xA4>uzelt.
Sleepless nights for mortgage lenders Real Estate
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck said last week.
Well, let the politician use the word "relatively" and he added that the German banking sector will also be affected by the critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich real estate financier, which is listed on the DAX index, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to be able to resist market turbulence.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: Credit aid amounted to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to throw interest.
The money comes from private banks as well as from public law.
The reason for this is the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to a report, state financiers with the money that was borrowed for the long-term projects financed them only for a short period – which now, due to distrust in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year, the bank’s capital reserve in cash has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of equity delayed slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, continuous financial investment income and net profit from financial transactions fell to zero, debtor’s imputability income and some securities also those of the dissolution of credit business provisions tended to fall by more than 70 percent, by 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and high revenues from reimbursements of the ex-Depfa group’s restructuring compensation expenses as well as the reimbursement of interest under the federal tax code and organized business for the consortium’s companies, the negative balance could charge a deficit of approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatisation in 1990 the former state financier was initially lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as a reason for founding the Aareal bank.
As much money could not be made with the financing of state projects, Defa began to devote intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations about the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of losses and profits of the group, it is said very inaccurately.
It is a fact that the dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007 they had been cut to two-thirds.
After the acquisition of the Deffa, the Hypo Real Estate became an important state and financial financier in the field of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans fell essentially because banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year, the Hypo Real Estate needs nearly 50 billion euros to fund a portion of Defa’s credit portfolios of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a credit the group’s need for funding for a short time and the company is assured of “the influence of the international monetary markets that are now essentially unfit to function.”
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, chairman of the board of directors of Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the monetary markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervision Institute (BaFin) are based on the fact that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That has to wait for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But because of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there is no consistency.
It is even conceivable that you do not need the funding in its full volume.
But the opposite case cannot be ruled out.
It was rumored that on the last Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, so temporary salvation can’t at least reassure concerned people.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Borrowing courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While the priority debts almost do not change, loan rates according to the position in the property record clearly tend to drop.
In particular, the loans of the former subsidiary W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg Hypo are affected and, with reason, the loans whose maturity is higher than in 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of the Deffa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments and banks that are under-affected are still ready to support the system, meanwhile pension amortization can be started within time.
Or something is going to happen, which no one can imagine - the financial crisis will overcome in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-news about partial statization, now the security that is already at its limit has become a justified hope.
That’s going to be a reason, because the creditors will spend the nights without sleep, breaking their head over the decision about their isolation from enthusiasm.
Still, short-term investors can put the end point and use new account transportation of losses for upcoming income tax payments on change in the future.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at Tachibana High School, the girls began to laugh: German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word mangas - in a report on the exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the Kawasaki direction and take a 40-minute train to Tachibana High School.
I just had to find the way, luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not set as rigorously as in my home, in Lower Saxony.
From eight in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty begins a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
Moreover, I am not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put an old skirt from the mother of my host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, so dressed I put myself on the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this time I was very happy because for two years I had started to study this language.
All 31 girls in the class have been spooning, laughing and making signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my manga.
That belongs to the vocabulary of survival of Japanese girls and means "moon, beautiful"
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really assaulted.
Everyone spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions – at the same time it is very difficult to understand English from Japanese.
Then in the recreation they all took out their Blessings.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring chunks of German bread.
It had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and something like tofu meat.
In most cases I have no idea what it is like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of seaweed in the salt, buff!
In Japanese schools, bentos are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a doll made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it away in the hope of getting to know him better during a recreation.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I am very curious to see if I can see it here as well.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always replied:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
For many years now, I’ve been reading Mangas.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a bit of Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I would travel there.
Also because I have a flack for tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a strict, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still haven’t felt lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Rats also have feelings.
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling danger flees, why is he also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can one control whether they, behaving in a manner similar to us, feel the same?
In an internet magazine called "Edge" for many years the contributions of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the chosen answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or someone else being able to prove it so far, although we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and consciousness in general, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as the other animals: it becomes dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar fashion, from which some scientists draw conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to infect our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuitry associated with human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (due to its involvement in short memory and executive functions that direct behavior).
This wide part is much more developed in the case of people than that of other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects related to our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to suppose that even man differs from the other primates.
Another peculiarity lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is linked to language, often that means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created as it were, in many cases would differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not allowed to be measured because it has special hardware, nor is it allowed to be analyzed through our experiences, then your research presents us with big problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the experience consent, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal awareness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that’s what happens during primate short-memory studies, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential thing is more to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two may be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what results from that for sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain that is responsible for that is activated, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when brain activity occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
From this point of view the sensations are very fixed apart from the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature, classifications of fine sensations follow because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar to be able to describe the states of others in pairs of ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, thinks that sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for body feelings and the brain stem, as Jaak Pankseep thinks, but focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can absolutely refer to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control whether rats and men behave in the same way?
Seeing the danger a cockroach flees, then why are you afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That’s true that neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain stems, cockroaches on the contrary don’t have at least one brain.
Is the trunk of the brain responsible for sensations?
Even when it is possible to test it for men: How can you test it in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally different from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, here progress in the field of neurology is expected as long as the same is measured in rats and men.
Since I don’t research the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don’t know if they exist.
It can be said that I do not see beyond my nose, but I prefer to move forward than to work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: deadline for grace for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister, said the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government views UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a confidence test of Ukraine's ability to host the European Championship alongside Poland," Wasjunik said.
“But that’s not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and in both countries there is a lot to do."
The schedule of construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
The number of stadiums is likely to be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
Now we have to do work at great speed,” said Ukrainian association president Grigorij Surkis.
"Uefa is not going to take our eyes off us."
In Poland a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish PZPN association and replaced it with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many clubs in the first division were convicted of downsizing manipulation to the lower category, finally also the division board had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid counterattack outraged
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about private life—and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan appointed her ex-husband as an adult.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The late war of the two roses in Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid’s ex-partner: eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with InStyle magazine, Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the marriage failure: “Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful.”
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - tells a story of the failure of a marriage.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his designation as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is “unheard of how many times Meg tells the stories of our relationship in another version,” the 54-year-old told The New York Daily News.
Among other things it is very "sad" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again "will publicly remember the pain and the changes, all of which means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is married again and recently is a twin dad.
And so it ends with his statements highlighting: “Whatever my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that’s fine.”
Prices of airline and hotel tickets are going down
In the first half of 2008, airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany became cheap even up to 50 percent.
Airline tickets and hotel overnight stays were again made cheap - these are the results of a study by the travel and financial services provider of American Express.
The company has analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and after price increases in the first quarter it found a big change in the second half.
After many years of hotel market prices continuing to rise, overnight stays on many sites became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe rose on average to 6.9 percent.
From April to June prices have already dropped to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
Trends were more perceptible in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar rate, which was the reason that “the interests of American tourists in traveling decreased.”
The decline in hotel prices is also noted much more in financial centers such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent, setting a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airline ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Because of the increase in kerosene prices, Economy class travelers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the prices of Economy class airline tickets, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but the price changes for Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, down to 23.6 percent in the second half.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of price change is on the one hand the rise of the loose economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the airline travel market, demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes aircraft traffic between the U.S. and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit distance flights in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him still does not go out to make the first goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented the forced landing of national team player Marko Martin very well.
The Gladbach player started playing late and failed to score a goal.
Everything he meant exactly by reacting to what happened could be clearly read from his lips.
I just knew I was right.
“We need a second goal,” Hermann Rieger whistled at the Hamburg stadium’s cabin entrance.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of the present was back on their sites.
Rieger was an HSV physiotherapist for almost three decades, and has a reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded his head and raised his fingers as a sign of assent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the head coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Go ahead, the second goal!
But that was not done.
"Today not everything was nice to see," Marcell Jansen later added.
Bastian Reinhard had also wished to have him "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) for his head impact; and also for the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all their strength to the weak Hamburg team.
“That was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol said, summing up.
This Monday the SV of Hamburg will turn 121 years old.
The Saturday of will be the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to interpret it,” said Marcell Jansen.
It is expected that the partial ratings in the table correspond more to the league's heeliness than to the dominance of its HSV.
The chip with its forced late players such as Brazilian Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to join, but still the chip can’t shine with their successes.
“We need more of the feeling and dribbling,” Jol demands.
After the defeat of the vote
On Wall Street, fear is spreading.
The first news of the failure of the banks’ bailout dropped the Down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the loss of the biggest points for a day in his history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little.
At 20:30 one of the most important stock market barometers in the world listed a 5 percent deficit in 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained at 1,548 points.
At the moment the biggest loser in the Dow Jones was American Express which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Goldmann Sachs’s shares lost almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, a large investor Warren Buffett had been financially involved in the company.
The bailout plan plans to make resources available to buy so-called “pods” mortgage stocks.
But the sum is going to be paid by hit but step by step.
As compensation for this, the state must receive the stock option receipts for financial partnerships that during the course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state's cash.
Stocks in Europe and the U.S. continue to decline
Billions of aid to banks in Europe and the U.S. does not reassure investors.
The stock price of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate drops and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the salvation of the state-projected financial market, the U.S. Dow Jones index continues to decline.
The losses of the speculated shares of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the German index (Dax) to drop in a large deficit.
Despite rescue actions by the federal government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier’s share of a time period lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6000 points and posted a 3.7 percent deficit in 5,839 units.
All over the world, financial markets have suffered a decline.
The opening of the Wall Street journey in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear the US government’s $700 billion bailout isn’t enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout, the Senate vote could be October 1.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei main index after profits fell to 1.26 percent in 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong the Hang-Seng index dropped to 2.1 percent until it remained at 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed remaining at 12,595.75 units.
After the announcement of the capital expansion, Arcandor's shares lost in the MDax.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the trade and tourism consortium announced that the shares in the company Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years now, a mystery phenomenon has caused researchers to wonder: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational assistance to maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity may not be so correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now threatens a death in the cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to manoeuvring, has caused controversy among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example, Earth.
This allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American spacecraft used this physical trick as did the Ulysses Sun probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles don’t behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravitation.
Irregularity of speed is more common.
Suddenly the probes have higher or lower speed.
The physicists could not explain this effect until now.
It was called the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity describing the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space may not be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study, believes solemnly now that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what the astronomers in the universe remained.
“The reason for the anomaly may be the Dark Matter that may also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
The researchers of the universe have known the existence of Dark Matter for only ten years.
It supposedly possesses the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means it does not send and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, Dark Matter makes at least one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Kidnapped tourists in Egypt are free
As Italy’s foreign minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of bailouts.
Six hijackers must be killed in a shootout during the release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the attention of the hijackers.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper talks about the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are, of course, released.
The same information presents the Egyptian state television, the Arabic TV station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After news of the release on the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
“Now we control your health,” Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are fine and are in security, Egyptian state television reports.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the hijackers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six hijackers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed with the rescue," the guard said.
It was just about "receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers have killed six hijackers and two of them have been detained in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded a bailout of Germany in the amount of six million euros; the money had to be handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom, referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the hijackers were afraid of their security.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men had to be stopped until the kidnappers had a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a stand on this report.
Stepfather abuse "leaded to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after admitting eight counts of indecent assault.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an investigative study, found that he had regularly tied his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court found that Mrs. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and sell her eyes before performing her sexual acts while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
Her stepmother moved to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Mrs. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs. Rande had said about her, which after being a great surfer and cyclist, now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "gave up her life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his Plymouth apartment.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by choking through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that concluded by saying, "I used to tie her up and open her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You're a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when he was just seven years old.
This nasty saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more clearly, it is that if she hadn’t done it, the matter probably wouldn’t have ended in court.”
"I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother the abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future.”
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet official who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a working trip by the Ministry of Defense, left two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were transferred to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
Surely this is the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of the intention of the offender.
The BBC’s defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the sentence had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
“They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the officer must be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Services Committee.
Forgotten documents contained secret information on Al Qaeda and the ability of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision Monday morning and then transferred from his home to a secret location.
Building companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the bailout/save of the Bradford and Bingley banks.
The government, in fact, provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 trillion to protect the deposits of the bank’s 2.6 million savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The CEO of the Association of Building Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers it "humiliating" that companies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 trillion loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley’s mortgages are redeemed.
However, the interest accrued in the interim is assumed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently ... are called to pay today the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
That is, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and that the brokerage companies had to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450,000 in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover <0xC2><0xA3>81,000 to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
“It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called upon to pay the price produced by those that were much less prudent.”
According to the BSA, there is no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
“We will need to look at all aspects of this issue in the coming weeks to find out what options there are to protect construction societies and their members from what could be a relevant price,” Mr. Cole added.
Interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of demanding interests, which can be almost twice as many.
As mutual construction companies are organizations and there are no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest rates on their savings.
The price of milk rises by five pence per liter
The inhabitants of the Jersey Shore will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the higher price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence per litre from next Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and following research conducted by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves if they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had risen before February was in 2002.
Denial of bail-out of former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A court in Bangladesh has rejected the application for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to jail when she returns to her country.
His supporters said the court did not grant him bail by accusing him of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the several corruption charges in your charge.
His longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
The return of Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country’s government, supported militarily, grant him first full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given the conditional freedom to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not now clear what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Superior Court.
“The Supreme Court rejected the petition for bail for Sheikh Hasina holding that he could not obtain bail because he was already being treated abroad under parole,” his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
Her defenders argued that she needed the freedom under bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to his homeland after October 17, according to a Awami League leader last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the Provisional Government, backed by the army, took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges that they are charged with.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan, the UN says, have not been able to take advantage of a recent anti-polymyelitis vaccination campaign due to Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces across the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials while carrying out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission following the decision forcing the company to reduce its stake in rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Appeals of Competition that it will have to reduce its stake in ITV by 17.9% below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB’s interests hampered competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB’s acquisition of ITV participation raised doubts about ITV’s independence, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin’s boss, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the obligation to reduce its ITV package was not reasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, BSkyB said, it would have delivered its voting rights.
New research into the hiring of U.S. lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the action by administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the officials questioned during the investigation have lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
“Severe allegations of possible criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or resolved,” Attorney General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. attorneys were removed from office by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that lawyers had been fired for low performance.
But later it was learned that the lawyers had not been rated worse than other colleagues, and many observers concluded that dismissals would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked in the persecution of some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
They can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure for dismissal, resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General’s report is very critical of Mr. Gonzales’ role in the matter, and underlines how he had a “primary responsibility” for dismissals, which he “abdicated” from his leadership position and was “notably non-collaborative” in the process.
Other officials, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's Epic of Much Honor
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect the special award next week at the ceremony that will take place in London, said getting this recognition will be "an honor".
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album Meat Loaf won in 1977.
The Coldplay group are leading the nominations for this year’s awards and ranking all four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, “There are some songs that transcend time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal ability like the one used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and peaked at number 15 in the rankings.
However, Meat Loaf’s Bat Out Of Hell remained on the charts for about nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation for his heart rhythm in 2003, after a breakdown during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst in his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply of service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-time local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of First Street – before I found Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
This alleyway, about 30 feet wide and 120 long, resembles a dusty alleyway more than an active road.
There are no signs.
It is almost impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
who wants to revamp Extra Place and create a clean hallway to the shops and boutiques that is expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old-time neighbors who commented on being enchanted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block’s past before the appropriation of buildings.
However, the City’s Department of Housing, Preservation and Development, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Community Committee on the Use of Land held this month, representatives of the Avalon agency drew up a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as Community District Manager Susan Stetzer said.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like you to continue to own Extra Place," she said.
“We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street.”
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as a coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street came up for the first time during this month’s meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it did not necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was the city’s desire to sell the street and noted that the agency’s mission is to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe that it got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, is atop Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that comes out on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
“The environment was magnificent,” said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, sheets, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the East Village’s aburgation, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modest as they may be, must remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, virtually unchanged, a city raja that should be protected.
Jerem<0xC3><0xAD>as Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made part of a talk of the city's history about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little narrow and unexplored alley, dark also by day and marked by rusted iron warehouse doors and counter-windows, with old week-old newspapers blown along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat was healed through the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle of about 22-oz were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said they rarely paid attention at Extra Place, but suggested they might be given a cleanup.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet, filthy places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old California studies associate and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling Hispanic voters effectively is a difficult business.
The educational proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that “African Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama’s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English-speaking students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in canceling the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and low-income families:
More than a third of the students, many of whom have just arrived, are learning English.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students, has been positively evaluated in the 2008 math exam.
And nearly an equally astonishing 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama’s favored one.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competences, and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of Sixth Street, the school’s approach to English instruction to students is in “total immersion.”
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, “We have had extraordinary successes with students like this one who have come from Mexico and that, if you enter the classroom 12 months later, you wouldn’t be able to pick up what it was.”
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate for other schools with large Hispanic-English student populations?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of their party politicians on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their constant support for bilingual education obscures the prediction of Mr. Obama’s response.
While it is that immigrants should learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the issue by letting people should stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
and instead, he said, "you should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil prices fall sharply after renewed economic fears <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The price of oil fell sharply on Monday due to concerns that the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
Shares of crude oil decreased by 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning’s trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had dropped to nearly $90 per barrel earlier this month, before falling back, once again, due to enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
The anxiety seized investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders who said they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process, confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, as the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that on the frenzy of the weekend, the negotiations that led to the rescue deal "appear to have failed to reactivate the sentiment of the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange rate is going to be increasingly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that the basic products will not be able to escape this contamination.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is assessing whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year, such as low oil consumption due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast for a 20 percent reduction in oil and gas prices by 2009.
Second madness quarter: team sets record
After spending, over the last eight seasons, longer than anyone in Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought I had seen it all.
Then he saw things unfold in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned a game without annotation into a game of deflation.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter started after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played loose under the shadows of the clouds.
At this point it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles performing a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect prediction for an afternoon, in which the evolution of the relationship between the players had a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the quarter, one when one cornerback fell and another came in with 10 seconds in the half.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, no matter what people may think.”
While Favre and Coles were performing in prison, the Cardinals' defense abused quarterback Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss Warner.
In the last tournament, Bowens’s fouls could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard kick to win a final 34-0.
They are the biggest points the Jets have ever made in a room.
The team coach, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the madness of this moment, said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third.
They have won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Gebrselassie rests at the top of her world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated because many consider her the greatest runner in history, surpassing her own world record at the Berlin Marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person able to run the race of 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After winning the home run in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has broken his previous record of 2:04:26 for 27 seconds, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the world record number 26 in a race of an impressive length so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from the clock race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing – perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect – that air pollution will aggravate her asthma problems.
Instead, he set out to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, employing on average about 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters he had suffered from cramps in the calf two weeks earlier and had lost a week of training.
It is evident that the suspension left him fresh, not oxidized.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything was fine."
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Afro-Oriental rival - for the style of orchestrating too many of his races, in general, avoiding the encounter with many world marathon stars, based on pacers as if it were a race track, and putting the record ahead of the competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s skills as a runner.
This Sunday, on the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half the race in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselassie after his paces declined.
But just before three miles from the goal, Gebrselassie took a final push to break away from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for nearly five minutes.
Kamathi came in third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also did not take part in the Beijing Games so it was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her personal best record in nearly five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made a smart calculation race, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to head off and then recovering them after 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and the tests of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the theme park of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, lies a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience remain very evident.
Eatonville, the first completely black-inhabited city incorporated into the country and childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guayaba, two schools and not a prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described — making it also a touristic stage through her inclusion in Florida’s travel guide produced by the Federal Writers’ Project of the Depression season — remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resist sharing their true ideas with the white man, who “knows so little about us and doesn’t know what’s going to be lost.”
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many are still cautious in front of the outsider.
“We’re very cautious about the way our story is told,” said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of the claim of blacks and a community of nearly 2,400 people living below a double poverty level of the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black South – sometimes neglected, other praised – that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who reside here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as here no one calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through downtown Florida often forgotten into the history of blacks and human drama.
Having a cement face both in life and in literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville’s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
“Outside the left-hand road,” he wrote, “there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write.”
She also mentions the widow’s new husband Dash and writes that Glenn Lee “sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transitional rooms.”
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston puts Eatonville in relationship with the autonomous government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't do it.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
“Zora described it as whatever it was,” said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls whom Mrs. Hurston immortalized by citing men who were singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who frequently returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, recalls that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without warning in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still prides itself on dressing with dignity.
Most of the residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” Franklin said.
But, she adds, swinging in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had been living.
At Eatonville, there were no major commemorative ceremonies, no major public readings.
“I don’t think their contribution to the world or their heritage was understood,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a 2003 biography of Mrs. Hurston.
A certain twist came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane road across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane street of the working community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to it relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred closer to the community.
“During that season, a group of white boys went around town throwing oranges and everything against the people sitting next to them,” Mr. Franklin said.
“They killed a girl, too, once.
He was thrown into a car wreck."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston he wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education, "insulted rather than honoring my race."
A. Residents say today that the disintegration of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville’s cohesion and undermined the confidence of its youth.
“Black children were used to being hugged — I remember this — they used to hug the teacher in the morning and in the evening,” said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
“I wasn’t going to hug your teacher because it was white — there’s a cultural gap there,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who went over prejudices, just as she did, with boisterous, confident lines like: “How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous grave and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the bookstores, reintroducing it to American canons.
The road project arrived just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter was again under the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
“The revived idea of the five-way road, would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a true civic pride,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped change the image of the same city.
People from outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began appearing in large numbers, and residents began reviewing the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (named after Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a street of the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come in search of Eatonville's history, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A prior permission is required to do most interviews, and some things — like murals in Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field — cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a courageous and convinced teacher who has a weakness for the bright red, still fear that her island community may be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of native pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw her entire race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and equally to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, stupid and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old Winter Park twins, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, in case they dare to go this far, will have to think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,’” says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it’s a very nice city.”
In New York, everyone is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and the giant television screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the bee nested offices that lie above their heads, the bankers and speculative fund managers who monopolize New York face daily the worst “office day” since the 1929 low.
Guys for home delivery continue to resonate their metal trolleys for tea through the sidewalks and carrying muffins trays for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to drag between buildings of charged apartments, as well as human mules, with 50 shirts of eccentric stamping hanging to a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in queue for their food to take in the morning, and it is still impossible to take a taxi in the middle of the 4 days.
Employees are still waiting to queue for their bagel to the vendors’ carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on the days of the week.
It seemed to me that there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time it took for the operation to coincide with the calm of the end of the afternoon at my local JP Morgan Chase subsidiary, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee’s window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where customers throughout life order their checkbooks, tourists look for instructions to go to Macy’s large warehouses and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my “personal banker of trust,” and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, still, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks in places they had switched them from, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money out of the so-called savings associations (a bit like a construction society), from the credit unions and savings boxes in their hometown whose whites only work within the state of ownership, and who say they treat customers like their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion bank, went into bankruptcy, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers in the offices and shops that were in front of me, fearing another collapse, were transferring their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the bailouts on Wall Street.
New York City’s ordinary people have become finance experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its distressing-looking executive director, Dick Fuld, commenting on the matter with familiarity as if they were complaining about a colleague’s inactivity.
And Lyn, fifty-something concierge in uniform from my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shopping at the tent.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "now I have all my savings in money market funds.
The switch is made, I'm not taking any risk."
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria approaches to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right party for the freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter belga, affiliated to the far-right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present to the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signals representing the mosques with a red line passing through.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for having desecrated a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country’s general elections.
More than 90 tombs were severely damaged at Traun Cemetery near Linz at some point between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but researchers think this may have happened by trying to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear if the incident was in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the profanation, which reached Muslim religious when Ramadan was about to end.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after turning right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that won nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against the headlines and burkas, and also voiced his opposition to food considered to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties tried to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the country’s strongest political bloc, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the captivating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the supervisory authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police issued a ban on traveling abroad last Thursday after judges had produced evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday, September 25 at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's trips abroad such as to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wished to travel abroad, by virtue of being under the register of sexual offenders.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to inform the police of the scheduled date seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss the individual case or the possible whereabouts of Glitter in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “Kent police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “Kent police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
“From our point of view, it’s easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is Kent’s top concern and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risks that may exist to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Court of Magistrates, west London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the UK for four months in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, calmed down and was glad to know that they had banned Glitter from travelling to France and Spain.
"Capture the master out of the scene to extract his character" G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no flyers, no debut outfits.
The essence of the great teachers of flamenco, stripped of concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On one side is the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments outside the public, when you find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a few hands, unconcerned because they will not go out on stage.
The German G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer in "Flamenco-people" alternates the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser-known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of the flamenco from different fields.
Included in the Flamenco Photography Month schedule, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, bigger every day," explains the creator, who explains that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people but, seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "in the street" are artists capable of conveying in the scene passion, sadness, joy... capturing the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists you do not have to take photos of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What interested me was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco.”
With the taste of the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1.997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, remember classical photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classical basis of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of dance, singing or touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who captivates with his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with the essential, with the duel that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata.
Famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, set up this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in Flamenco-people, the photographer admits that "I love portraying people, meeting them and being able to enter a moment in their life, be it a long or short moment.
I think that within photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, who sometimes you don’t even know, or who leave you just a few minutes to be able to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco that bears the title "Flamenco-people" is on display at the Galeria El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata, located at 20 de la Mata Street, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where you can visit until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a terror"
It’s set in places he doesn’t yet know and talks about unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to bringing forward the new project he works on, a novel starring Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and passed through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize-winning literary critic confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project he is working on today "is a bit of a scare" and that "everything indicates he shouldn't write" the novel.
“If I were sensible, I wouldn’t, but I’m going to do it and I hope to finish it someday,” he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchanging ideas, thought and words that for four days he’s seen passing through the city of Aqueduct to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the featured figures of the third edition of the party of the word and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival Award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend" - filled the apron of the theater Juan Bravo.
presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him an audience given to him who was made very short the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read", and "live more of what he saw"
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people "more disproportionate", so he called on the writers to "cry" it.
Climatology closes the Pozoblanco fair that also runs out of radii
The ray celebration that closed the subscription of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended on the morning of yesterday, after checking the speakers announced that the floor of the square was not in the best condition.
Thus, according to Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the company decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
Weather inclement weather has begun with this fair, as finally two of its three festivals have not been able to be celebrated.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second scheduled bull race.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a prison in Castilblanco.
There was a party on Friday.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and came out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante sold his two stalls with greetings and an ear, which granted more the tenders than his bulldog.
That was, even worse, El Juli, who passed through Los Llanos’s skin without pain or glory.
In his second bull, after a beacon of relief, he won the bronze of a large part of the public.
A control in <0xC3><0x81>lava jumps in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five less than ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipal term Armin<0xC3><0xB3>n (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Agents stop the two occupants of a van and they take off.
His load, more than two tons of hashish, was not like stopping.
The officers pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., the Interior Department of the Basque Government said in a statement.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the <0xC3><0x81>lava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control at the N-1, passing through the municipal term Armin<0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, hurried abruptly, and jumped in control.
The officers began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later in the archenemy, when its two occupants flocked to flee the race through a wooded area.
The ertzians finally gave access to one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashage they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hashish charges, so they proceeded to move it to police stations for a thorough inspection and drug weighing.
In addition, officials found that the registration had been "doubled" as it did not coincide with the collection in the van's documentation, so the arrested has also been charged with a felony of forgery of public documents.
Ertzaintza continues the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape the race as has been said, and determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old detainee, A.A.J., was transferred to police units to carry out the corresponding diligence and will be made available to the court in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under the Effects of a Drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda from the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers as she tried to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California highway patrol.
The witness said that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot back and forth, and as he walked back he passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who had apparently initially not recognized the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and exit the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted the emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
“She looked disoriented,” so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center to perform a test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress was cooperative and the excess alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "as the officers observed at first sight, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drug."
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under the effects of some substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison around 7 p.m. although he was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where she was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU federation to assume its competences in the Silva case
IU’s general coordinator and United Left deputy, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Councillor of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of being a family member.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competences," Llamazares said of the performance that the party will have to adopt with which it has so far advised in the Seville Consistory.
However, the IU leader argued that the need for “transparency” is present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva may have committed: “IU has always argued that these kinds of issues have the maximum degree of transparency.”
In the same line he stressed that the formation has "strict ethical codes for all public offices".
'May's Blood', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French in Blood of May, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the stream of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a in front of a wide cast of performers.
May's blood, with a shoot above two and a half hours, will premiere this Friday in cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours duration.
A great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s literature, José Luis Garci assures to have fulfilled with this shoot "a dream of childhood", which must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid three years ago commissioned him to shoot a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2nd in Madrid, when the Basque country was re-accepted.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" to set up with the decorations and the appropriate clothing the portrait of "a Spain that was wrong to fight for, since, the struggle for independence led the people to a huge delay with the Iron Curtain.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had a funding such as Alatriste’s or The Ghosts of Goya – more than twice that of Blood of May – so he has not been able to shoot some plasma scenes in a script signed with Horacio Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
For this reason, the director of Back to Start, has focused on what is his usual way of working, staging with the actors, with whom he usually tries before starting the shoot and those who do not casting, for he thinks it "humiliating" and considers that "part of the director's job lies in going to the theater and the cinema that he knows.
Many of the interpreters with whom he coincides in Blood of May repeat in front of his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar nominee - of which he won one - Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Blood of May itself, Seven French billiard tables and the one finally selected, The blind sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, that is to say, that it has to be seen.
With this film Garci does not expect awards.
“In the beginning, you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you agree to make one more film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n recovers the essence of the Sevillan dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillan dancer.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the neighborhood of Triana and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in interwar Europe, fascinated Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I thought it was amazing.”
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell his life but to collect his spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco sticks to me.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" suggested to me a guajira, or "the snake dance" a few tangos.
His dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic.”
The montage features two exceptional collaborations: Miguel Poveda’s that will once again sing Isabel in one of his shows, just as he did in “The Open Door”; and with teacher Matilde Coral, who has exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever his student was.
"Matilde makes Tortola the eldest, the character of maturity.
I am happy that you have agreed to act in my work and I feel very honored for it.”
The montage also includes the musical composition and guitars of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; the percussion of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez.
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman who developed in such distant places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, as she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to remember it because I think it’s from those women who have a huge influence at a certain time and now no one knows and much less value their work,” Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n says.
The show will begin today at 20.30 hours at the Lope de Vega theatre.
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Trienium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Council of Culture of the Junta de Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>a (Junora de Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>a) to celebrate the "Zem<0xC3><0xB3>n" and the "Zem<0xC3><0xB3>r<0xC3><0xB3>n" (Zer<0xC3><0xB3>n)
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n" will come to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of the Nobel and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: That Chopo de l'light", which was inaugurated last May in New York via las las si sier.
Also, the Council of Culture of the Junta de Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>a has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Aussie of Malice", and gives the idea of the disappearance of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman has left.
It was hard to give him an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And I knew he was very sick.
It was still a nightmare for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” Robert Redford cried, “my life and my country were better because of their existence.”
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerated.
A father of cinema and homeland had died at a particularly dark time, fearing terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue men and very few beings to admire you are left, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It was an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth for all.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a champion of lost and won causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his first-born dead by overdose to his homemade and organic food brand.
It’s a gift to a country that has cost a lot to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of admiration barricades Hollywood without adhering to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not a man has died but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was neither more nor less than the peak of his career.
Australia’s bad boy, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“It’s left us all very high,” said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping the demand for probity high and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once but was then married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when he was sure he was out of opportunities to not be.
"But why am I going to eat burgers out of the house, if I have steak inside?" he used to joke himself.
In the sky, he sees the pride of having his daughters on earth match his fans, something not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud as that of devoted husband, loving father, solicitous grandfather and dedicated philanthropist,” they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that some Olympics are held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I say no!
The perfect race they called it, and in my opinion it has been the worst race with much that I have been in.
A peak of disproportions which, of course, if taken into account as an assessment and I examined it, would be a very clear suspension.
But let’s go to parts and from the beginning.
Disadvantages begin with collecting the dorsal, which makes you have to go first.
Which doesn’t sound bad to me, but if you already get them to give it all (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the dorsal (first purpose, go only for that) and (after the relevant glue), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second purpose, because I need a size XL)
In what world do we live?
Or have they decided by the crisis to buy only small T-shirts with fewer fabrics and cheaper ones?
Well, things like this are a little bit compared to those of the race day.
Apart from having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes of waiting lasted, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as was expected, the race started and we hadn’t left the backpack yet, although once we got it, the pick-up was worse.
In addition, the rain softened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which joined with concatenations of popular rebellion and assault on the cassette.
I think about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, won’t even show up at the right time in the rankings, because of the chip they gave me that, I guess, didn’t mark my exit properly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect race, it wouldn’t get into my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference Microsoft has shown an advance of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a launcher to move around the company’s campus).
Thanks to a camera and facial recognition system, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group the present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he’s there to visit someone and tells them he’ll see you soon.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week has been much talked about over a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won’t have as many programs associated with it.
Steve Ballmer has found that if computers came with the essentials instead of commercial junk loads, they would go five times faster – man, Steve, it will be for less.
All one finding bearing in mind that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and also the software.
When Google Chrome came out on the network, I was one of those who added to the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many correctly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the hardware and software to be understood.
Perform the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never go away, but one must think of the “death” of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer has said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People increasingly pay less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts only to run Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half of the applications that come in the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and that they are finally an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft’s employee lounges in Redmond earlier this month.
In the soda machine a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather shooting at 2010.
At Microsoft they will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more and more computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, is going to pass bill.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso was wearing it on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio was wearing one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we start to enumerate stellar apparitions, we can go back to the image of that punctuated mustache force that lifted weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it’s nothing more than the typical men’s cotton, zipped and sleeveless interior t-shirt.
The 'tank', which the English call the speakers, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out over all the others.
First, because of its name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with the sport because it gets its name, according to legend, from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out over the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (unrecognizable) that the most emblematic t-shirt models wear as detail in the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, navy t-shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Clothing designed for comfort underwear.
It’s a shame to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
“I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn’t care.”
His huge resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters take their new fashion activity very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than pretty and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that Mango makes at its new headquarters, in addition to presenting the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, win in short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; from there we draw many references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and watch women dress like they do, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and they have a lot in common.
As a child, I liked my clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to hang out in my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I was dressed.
You know that dancers like to do our styles for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress when you are given the costume is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You've been in your 30s not long ago, have you been in a crisis?
What's up?
I feel better than ever, I like the 30s.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I’ve done the things I wanted to do since I was a kid and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because my body asks for it and I also want to be a young mother; I don’t want to lose it.
As for the candidate, I don't care.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the movie, you're on the verge of several premieres you shot last year.
That is the way it is, and I want you to see the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and anxious, everything I want for now and of course, can not be.
I'm looking forward to the premiere of 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of the Tomb of Christ'.
See what they look like...
A few days ago you made your debut on a walkway with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I went up to a runway to make a model.
Just called me Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we exhibited - I took out two pieces from our collection for Mango - were auctioned to raise money for this NGO Naomi.
People don't know Naomi's tender heart.
So many things are said about her that, I who know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I stay with that good part that she gets involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he comes to ask me to make the pine, then so do I.
To benefit third-world women, whatever it takes.
Recurring drivers for alcoholism will have to install the 'alcolock'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholism, have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the drunk vehicle from starting, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and now appears already included in the annual memory of the State Attorney General’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last a year.
Its purpose is the reinsertion of the driver, so the driver will also receive a road re-education course.
In the experience, in addition to the General Prosecutor’s Office of Road Safety, the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT) and the Instituto Tecnol<0xC3><0xB3>gico para la Seguridad del Automo (FITSA) Foundation will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for driving drunks again take the car.
The alcoholock would avoid it as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow abs; or when an alcohol concentration is detected it is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and would run on account of the sanctionee.
In this regard, a study conducted in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce violations by up to 65% during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people each year.
The measure is subject to administrative sanctions for two reasons: addressing those behaviors before they result in criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done on an ordinary basis, and yet the necessary reform by criminal means requires reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been experimentally deployed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on a PSOE initiative in which it is proposed to install this system on school buses, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., the scheduled time for the program was landing at the presidential hangar of Mexico’s Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez airport, DF, the Spanish Air Force aircraft in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced to use the hand as a visor to see the real couple descend from the plane.
On foot on the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very good, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that hour... she's from here or something...
- No, no sir, she's Spanish but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
There are many who wait in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 marines who interpret the rescue of honours.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, furry to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps they had told her that in the DF there was a threat of storm.
They give a smile and a stopover to the photographers before moving to the room where the official committee is waiting.
At the door of the hotel they are staying in, one of the four big ones in the city, a Mexican television reporter is waiting for them.
The Best Gifted Prize of Fashion
There may be no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, than Paris and possibly no more exquisite living designer and bont vivan than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of The Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in Mango’s shop at 54 rue Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
By the way, it is the firm’s second largest store in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, combined with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the contest, made us end up at a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with his heart set on pain and heart beating, by the recent death of his brother, put on a suit of the House and some ELAH garments, which cut off his breath, and the arm of his son Luis - a cannon almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in his homecoming.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, next to the Baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because they had both been loaned to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store with pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner she transformed with a sexy long black dress, was excited when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, loved a barge.
Inés Sastre did not stay on the walk for the dependencies of the palace, but before he taught us on the mobile phone photos of his son.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the view with the presence of Olivier Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez - another canyon that travels by bike - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously asked, that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, it's life.
1001, the number of anti-stress
There are not 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frantic everyday life.
And as if it were little, they are all gathered together in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarmist almost punishes when he sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to imagine himself wrapped up in the hustle and bustle of current life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and disconnection problems with the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Aside from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together on the pages of an entire book a 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores by the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If one considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect the mind, and focus on reading.
Talk about sleeping.
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very scared telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk while they are asleep.
The first time it happens you carry a fear, but it doesn’t really matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquios.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one person has been told that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life for example associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, nighttime enuresis (sleeping) or sleepwalking, but it doesn’t have to be that way.
As we have already mentioned above they can also be associated with very high fevers, stress or overexcitation situations.
However, it is a poorly studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be that you speak in a calm tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or all the other things (cries, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives it out in this way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress disorder).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid shows or TV series that are scary or a little violent.
With very nervous children and who find it hard to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain inner calm.
This will allow the child to have a quieter sleep.
Once the somnolences appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what has happened.
Helpful advice
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Even though he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you show up very distressed during several episodes it would be good to consult or find out what is causing so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common), don’t fall into the temptation to ask him for information.
You won’t get anything, because when you’re asleep you’re not aware of how to organize your thinking.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming of saying that, so be very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can question him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing, it’s an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory in his field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having made a good game, the team created many goals and was able to score a goal to win the game.
The pace was not very constant during this encounter in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to smash the squad with a shot from afar, Illhausern was almost going to take the "power" and by turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold coming to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we should not let the midfielder pass and we should only leave Riahi in the attacking position.
The start of the second half was crucial, first with two goals from Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illhousiens with the Marais goal, well positioned to pick up the rejected ball in a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the goalkeeper Illhousiens will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the wardrobe a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the opportunity and will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who retreated a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after a major foul, the ball passed very close to the crossfield.
Sarkozy finds angry fishermen
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a rodeo through Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance by fishermen who strongly disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, to meet his representatives there.
They promised to welcome him " with a constructive spirit " and hope that " he will come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " created by Breton fishermen to achieve measures against the increase in oil prices, which marks a record at 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Eliseo spokesman David Martinon, the president “will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to be competitive again and to save the conditions of jobs and pay for sailors.”
Fishermen wait for Nicolas Sarkozy on foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce circulation in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused jams of almost 10 km.
Quiberon’s marina has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le have not been stopped.
"A filtering barrier" has been put on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors had already shown their determination by burning, by shaving the dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the buoys remained at the port, or in Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday’s meeting that will take place at the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the national fishing committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not abandon " and " they do not want to move to Paris ", for example, announced Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient fishing committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay oil taxes, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial equilibrium point of a ship can be reached only with one diesel with a price of less than 0.30 euros per litre.
The Magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two Men and a Destination " has died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its 2008 delivery forecasts
The Brazilian aeronautical company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
The world’s fourth aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 aircraft delivered, Embraer President Fredrico Fleury Curado said.
During the first half, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which has been pulled out of trouble thanks to U.S. monetary authorities, aims to sell more than 15% of its assets with the aim of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States.
AIG’s board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG intends to separate from include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, the Financial Times adds.
No definitive decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times says.
AIG must quickly liquidate to repay its $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing U.S. authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with the right proportion among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange blamed a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to save banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen on the nearly 800-point stock exchange, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most significant drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past September 17, 2001, the day on which the exchanges began again after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq index, a technology-dominant, dropped 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the Standard & Poor's 500 expanded by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis early in the session, Wall Street sank after an unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save banks that would have allowed some stability to recover in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, the representatives denied U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
About two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“That’s not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market had this plan,” added Lindsey Piegza, fearing a project adopted within several days would arrive “too late.”
“If the project is really dying ... the Fed and other central banks will quickly take the lead (the American central bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions more,” said Brian Bethune, head of Economics and Finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, " every passing day is announced the fall of a financial institution " in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets face “not only a crisis in the US but a global crisis,” the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen dramatically.
The 10-year Treasury bond yield fell by 3,632%, against 3,827% on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond by 4,161%, against 4,357% on the evening.
Obama, winner of first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House was followed by another to find out who has won between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, though honorable, was not “brilliant enough” to allow him to curb his decline in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose poll of public opinion published last Saturday gave Obama five points (49 percent vs. 44 percent for McCain), thinks it’s the Democrat who did well.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama came out victorious with 39% of those polled, while 25% of them concede victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his candidacy member, Jose Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
It has good instincts,” he warned, however Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventeen-year-old McCain highlighted his undisputed foreign policy experience, underlining his opponent’s “ingenuity” about these issues that were at the heart of this first round.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” he accused several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president,” he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama said he represents the future.
Unconcerned, it proved concise and precise.
He enhanced his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so,” a Democratic television ad this weekend repelled the Republican for not considering the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans.
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in a rainstorm.
He did not pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers." "The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by the Americans to be the most capable of saving the economy that is at the edge of the precipice.
“Next week could be a decisive episode,” said influential and Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to Bill Clinton’s during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster “is the final eight-year consequence of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that it would, in spite of everything, reduce the taxes of 95 percent of Americans despite the Wall Street outbursts, the Illinois senator also noted that the realization of eventual energy independence from the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the creation of a safety and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudently, both candidates evaded issues related to the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial bailout plan adopted by Congress this afternoon and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon from the closure of polling stations in central Minsk square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, numerous youths had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "The dictator, he has to resign".
Some recognize not having voted, "for what, as they will do what they want with my vote," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has put foreign observers well in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
Sanctions, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
It was not according to the opposition.
“We have been put next to the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of votes,” said Youri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, it's the executive power.
If some members of the opposition enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
“But their entry into parliament can mean television appearances, meetings in the regions, and bills.”
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debt to Russia, goes into crisis, and if we don’t reform ourselves, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the participation figures seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) favoured the manipulations.
"Have you noticed the election?" asks Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five MPs from the opposition to parliament, those that are best suited to power.”
The silence of the night returns to the square in October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it regained the public’s confidence that it had been seriously rocked by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public dissatisfaction, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which aimed to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for such a disaster not to be repeated again.
While Judge Krever was late in presenting his relationship, certain provinces then set up a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
" In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, nearly 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Having made a lot of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work over the years that followed, we have regained public confidence,” he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94 percent of the Quebec population had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we were witnessing in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Décary says.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know and when a serious illness can stem from that, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we instituted exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had remained in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense.”
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests that allow directly in the blood of donors to detect the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
Nucleic acid tests allowed to shorten the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, she explains.
We were able to reduce this period in less than a week.
In this way, we substantially reduce the risk that certain donors will be infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements allowed to significantly lower the risk of contracting AIDS by a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"That means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
So since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I think it is possible today to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without worries,” says the head of the Héma-Québec administration.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It must be constantly vigilant,” Dr. Décary pursues before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
“Needs are increasing because the population is aging.
Since anti-cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors that regroups on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation.”
All people with good health, 18 years old and who meet the eligibility criteria can still donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travel to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
The pains are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it’s hard to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since current life is very rampant, we rarely find time to spend an hour donating her blood,” says Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered as biomedical waste is filled with a blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
“We celebrated a few weeks ago, putting on the bench of our thousandth blood sample of the umbilical cord and is expected to bring out more than a thousand of these per year.
We’d have to start proposing it for grafts early next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood-taking program as very popular.
“Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot enjoy this,” as Héma-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Softball - The Impact in the Semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-finals of the USL's first-division knockout series, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 finals) victory at the Seattle Sounders' expense yesterday during the second and decisive game of the quarter-finals at Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without a goal anywhere, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plantentino created many goals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who sacked Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first game of the series of back-and-forth matches, on Friday, Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in the Seattle suburb.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the game back to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless conceded in the semi-finals 5-4.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short – Kovalev’s winning goal
The Canadian’s number one trio is ready to start the season.
Alex Kovalev's composite unit, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack in a 3-2 win by the Canadian to free-kick the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the Tricolor quarter in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I've stopped the Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play as much as possible in the first half, Guido Carbonneau noted.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation.”
Charest takes care of the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out running elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party’s general council ends, Jean Charest went yesterday to Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Health Minister, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to get elected during today’s partial election.
Reject the limits of our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength remaining on the great lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great media as during the election period.
The prime minister thinks the elections will take place this fall, although he showed that his schedule was very full.
The “Northern Plan” is the fourth side of a “vision” that the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a “new economic space”, which comprises an agreement on the labour force with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe, and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister was limited to explaining why the North was " a jewel of immense potential " but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could be most developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, forest, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond," according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as big as France" is our home, it's in Quebec.
It’s not just our home, it’s in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he was requesting a national founding myth.
Quebec was built much thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the laughter towards gold in Abitibi, the Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
“It belongs to us, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion presents, I reiterate that position on the part of the government,” he said.
In addition, “with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will open every year due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member of the Quebec party of Ungava), have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role began some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting in which " a common vision will be given " .
The development of the North would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan "will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought otherwise of transforming the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival in the party’s power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central to Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa who made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future," said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, the conservative one, John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Touching on the topic of Eastmain1a-Ruper's hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
"This stays between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his militants, raising applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which the law allows.
He points out that his schedule is nevertheless full, particularly due to a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no problems being accepted. The Liberal Party of Quebec in particular demanded recognition of the " Quebec specificity " in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to name members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and have them veto over decisions made in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcome the great lines of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, dropped it.
If he had done so, "we would have made progress today", Mrs Marois said alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that took place today), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what you want is that this isn't just a show," said leader Sebastian Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns on vacation today.
Letras - An unhonored country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh irony!) in the Harper Cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
Dishonoring this woman who led an incessant fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration for what she says about the relations of Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national that is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are recriminated to him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, renounces its promise and lets a child-soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who deals with a false justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to benefit from an equitable process in Canada.
It’s this government that closes its eyes on torture: it doesn’t care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of abuse.
We still don’t realize that, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy,” that’s the word Harper keeps repeating and that doesn’t make sense.
The time has come when there is no morality left: we can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far wants a minority (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that praises the Virtue, the Law, and the Order: they don’t see this government giving up what our country’s reputation and dignity did.
Mr. Toews, shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian miner Barrick Gold.
Following Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world’s largest gold company attempted a six-million-euro defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation prosecutions, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his own?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little importance, and the authors and publisher of the Noir Canada book will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers held by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly arrangement that will cushion the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who dares to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of public opinion that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by garrot strikes.
It was enough for the mine to open its books, its records and establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects the petitions and supporting letters to the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can ask for a “public” debate by disregarding his views?
According to the Vice-President, this word appears to refer only to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What he doesn’t understand – or what he doesn’t want to understand – Barrick Gold, is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does it mainly because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but on the basis of civilized changes of arguments, and not within the framework of what many people perceive as a persecution-bite (persecuting the "public debate," Barrick Gold has just filed a claim with respect to the authors of Noir Canada no longer using it).
In addition to Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on university freedom of inquiry and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the wealthy companies of this world in a country like Canada, under many persecutions, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he intends, he has no desire to make a transparent debate.
It’s a loss for the university world, but also for public debate in Canada, and it’s time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
It provides, in particular, for better control by the electors of its implementation, of new mechanisms aimed at ensuring the reimbursement of public money invested, of new provisions to contain the number of houses embroiled in the lack of payment, as well as a right of control over the salaries paid to the heads of the aided companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
“We have made great progress with a view to an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Everything has been done to cover up the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street,” she explained.
“It’s the fundamental point: if we don’t do this, the trauma, chaos, and disruptions to Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” Republican Judd Gregg said.
Negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that would cause a new failure in investor mood.
The last hour that had been set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the U.S. presidential election, who have been late in the negotiations, were rather supportive of the deal, not forgetting to express their dissatisfaction with being forced to reach this extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the deal, particularly one that would allow owners to retain their domicile and the one over the salaries of the leaders of the state’s surviving companies.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to congratulate themselves.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, interrogated on another chain to find out if he would vote for the proposed plan, responded that: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
“The important points I’ve read [show] that it’s something we’ll have to digest and with which we can move forward.
He said the option to do nothing is not acceptable.”
The $700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers’ money dubious debts, risk assets, and unsaleables from U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the explosion of a real estate bubble that first led to the sinking of risky mortgage loans before spreading to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and causing a liquidity freeze and an outburst of banks and financial institutions.
It’s a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft deal last week.
We believe we’ve been out of the stagnation since the Democrats accepted that certain “toxic” assets from struggling companies are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
With the aim of bridging the slumps for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to take on losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would seek to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of $250 billion to which another $100 billion may be added if the president feels it is necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by Congress.
Instead of his help, Washington will get stakes in the relief companies that will be worth dividends in case of profits and that will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the option of delaying embargo procedures involving housing obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and on cash compensation paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and to that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all your efforts, you are still not sure that your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, both by Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the chamber’s finance committee, told his constituents that “with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand.”
“We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But not the one that consists of taking advantage of the taxpayers.”
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, who is animator of a small group in Congress, presents the problems in another way, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred economics professors, among whom three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us to say: we ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path to take,” he said.
At this very moment, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had given up buying its competitor in bankruptcy since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) during the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is part of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regain a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It’s just something that savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
During this time, across the Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take care of all outstanding loans at the Bradford and Bringley bank and more than 41 billion euros (US$75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the British bank’s branches and bank accounts.
Bradford and Bringley Bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
The American actor with a lovely smile had freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His smell, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident will have also taken him away from the record of power that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last American film icons of the 1980s.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, whom he looked a lot like and who was long regarded as a rival in cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian-born mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without unmeasured ego, last quality mark.
Because it featured an entire country in love with the self-made man, the warfighter of the Pacific, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, television and soon in cinema.
This man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who was ranked second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, though a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of the world of the show that we do not know very well, also disappear with him.
He is an honorable man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s death caused vertigo to the cinephiles this weekend as his big roles interspersed on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of seventh American art in perpetual movement parades through it.
Many memories return to memory as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on the adapted zinc roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone into the history of cinema.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This friendly eater in the sumptuous film The Sting (The Golpe), Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and vengeful in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which in 1987 earned him his only Oscar among nine nominations.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
He's still alive.
Times change during his career.
Young people know him mostly thanks to George Roy Hill’s Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes’s Road to Perdition in 2003, the rice was curdled.
Contrary to several film legends who left the race quite early, Newman remained much in the film world, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its fasts, and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, "as a challenge that lives in " underplaying " and that judges its performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young galan than of marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, cabron or desperate, whose features reflected the rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed sides of his true not-so-known puditic sensibility.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott due to overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of shame and sadness.
"Among the many tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former fellow gunman Robert Redford (who had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very sadly: "My life and my country were better because of their existence."
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, there is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant against Hollywood excesses.
We have seen much of his face reign over the boats of vinaigrette sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
The profits from these sales were given to your Children’s Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than content with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and so generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce in the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Very soon, on October 8, the criminal trial against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing significant, business-like and organized fraud in addition to other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, they used for their own purposes the funds obtained in public tenders, often justifying the fulfilment of the tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the municipalities - totaling some 65 million HUF - stopped partly in the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization and partly in the pocket of private persons.
The method, which was disclosed by the researchers as well, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no actual execution, the different associations never fulfilled their assumed obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were false.
For this they obtained the talents in the market of the District of J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros and the circular stamps were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the forged invoice was to be made was decided among others on that tour of the Upper Region of Balaton where J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag sent to Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption and these served as a model to make the invoices they presented, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labor Affairs, as well as in the City of Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and his accomplice Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, who according to our information rather wrote the necessary reports to obtain public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his colleagues, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Association Biztos Pont S<0xC3><0xB6>l<0xC3><0xBC>get.
However - according to the center manager - so many people do not fit in that place at the same time.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation – later called Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt to Third <0xC3><0x89>vezredért – was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however the bill consisted of one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of fancy invoices also exaggerated when they pointed to the food center Pigal Kft. because in the tenure of books of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1>.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the manager of the company, informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor’s office and showed him the invoices, he already knew that they were fake documents.
"On the label the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: In addition to the formal problems, he also did not agree that according to the bill, 100 people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people are accommodated.
In addition, meals were also included in the bill, while the restaurant has long been idle.
The enthusiastic invoice makers were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so that in the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated a trip within Hungary as a service, which did not coincide with the agency’s practice of sending invoices.
In addition - as was known during the investigation - the document included VAT as well, although trips outside the territory of the European Union were tax-free.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révf<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xB6>p Kft. for the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért foundation, since the services of that company are not loaded with a 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, in addition, the hotel employees only extended invoices made to the machine however the invoice was.
In addition, the “senders” made other mistakes as well, as in the case of a company in which they put in the invoice as an activity carried out the road transport to which – it was known during the investigations of the prosecution – does not carry out the company founded as an investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp - it was known that the invoices sent to the Third <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Foundation for Eg<0xC3><0xBC>tt are false, for the XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Cultural Association and for Biztos Pont.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehert<0xC3><0xB3> Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue those invoices.
The counterfeiters also paid no attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért S<0xC3><0xB6>giet ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za was in the process of liquidation, so the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - refused to have issued such a document.
Consciously expedited the invoices
Another group of fake invoice manufacturers are those who were aware that they should issue fictitious invoices.
The Esely Budapest Foundation, at the request of Young Child - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Sozialist<0xC3><0xA1>k, issued an invoice for the value of about 4 million HUF on behalf of the Fundaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Egy<0xC3><0xBC>ttt to Third <0xC3><0x89>vezred.
The manager of Collab Kft. - according to the indictment - was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
Similarly, he collaborated with Zuschlag and his associates the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 supplied invoices worth approximately HUF five million to the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny foundation, the Atlasz Association and the V<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>sfeny<0xC5><0x91> Association of economic activities.
There was no capital movement either, as they later cancelled the prepared invoices but forgot to make their documents to this entity.
The following group of fake invoice manufacturers include those who have some connection with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian manager of the fictional Delta Trio SL based in Budapest, which dealt with the fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to research data these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which since September 14, 2005 is under liquidation process.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov should have also sent documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices on behalf of the company for Atlasz, for Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> and for Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny charging the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian Albanians at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because – according to the defendant – they did not receive a job.
But he took advantage of these companies, as at the request of his accomplice lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company’s registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generation.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor’s Office considered that Kubatov received the VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri-command society to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3> y Sz<0xC3><0xB6>vetség presented a competition for Modern Hungary in the month of January 2006 for the T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Foundation (TMA), public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
They obtained 500 thousand HUF from the contest, respectively, but did not use the money for the purposes of the contest.
In order not to be discovered, five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft were presented to the TMA.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will likely report in the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor's Office - the course of the forgery of the invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to speak of everything, this has not done so until now.
The question is: what interest does he have to do?, because perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists came to an agreement with him so that Zusi would assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to relieve his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of far superior economic crimes, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can await the sentence in their own home, he has no chance of that.
Overlapping Psychology: Why Do We Spend More Money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York discovered the neurological – economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in the journal Science, people don’t want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
The scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other participated in an auction and, in the meantime, the functional magnetic resonance imaging system (fMRI) examined the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games participants could earn money, but during the auctions, where it is fundamental to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the operation of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the “self-prize” mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention so as not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To base their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups bet against one person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply told the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive $15 more prize.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction, the group members lost even that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure was highlighted.
However, by testing the neurologists’ hypothesis, the members of the group who played “against failure” were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the “winner” group.
“These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
For those so far explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only the visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
In the world, about five hundred million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of people infected in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the patients do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the common name for different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms look very similar; they are characteristic of liver infection and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the pathogen are spread through two main forms: Hepatitis A and E by food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), Hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body humors (sperm, mood of the vagina, saliva).
Travelers are advised to protect themselves against the virus A and B, there are no vaccines against C.
Hepatitis A symptoms appear two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifested by a general bad state, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After this appear on the skin and in the white of the eyes jaundice, the excrement becomes clear, dark-colored urine and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Every year, one million people worldwide die from liver cancer and cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in ten infected people receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most of the infected do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys the liver cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
Premature recognition, systematic medical control, is therefore very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and those who carry tattoos.
Currently, there are about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory control as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptom.
The disease has healing if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so it can suppress the infection and prevent cancer.
30 September is World Hepatitis Day, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its goal is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their early recognition.
Does it hurt less who believes in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, the religious faith has a calming effect that also alleviated the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed what religious belief in how it influences human pain – reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
Within the framework of this unique experiment they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the scanning technique of the human brain, it was verified that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of a series of researches in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University are also involved.
The analysis took place as follows; they fixed a flashing instrument to the patient's left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to fix their gaze on two paintings; the Virgin Mary, a work of 17th-century Sassoferrato and the Lady of the Arminum of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th-century.
The researchers had hoped that the Virgin Mary’s spectacle would provoke a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo’s oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a calming effect.
The patients spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electrical shocks in four successive parts while observing the religious-themed painting or the other.
The Catholics claimed that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected" people, "they calmed down and in their heart ruled peace."
Looking at the religious-themed picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so striking you can achieve a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
“We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positive, like a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation.
“The exercise of faith should and in many cases really change our personality,” Wright added.
After these formidable results there remains only one question: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of her size were shown to the faithful?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On its 10th birthday, Google can claim: it can be found both in people’s pockets and in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, what doctors they visit, and what interests them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with Orwellian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s primary goal is to collect as much personal data about its users as possible, and this is necessary to be able to meet the original goals of Google’s founders: “We gather in one system all the information in the world!”.
According to Google’s leader, the company even after ten years of work that revolutionized the world is still in the early stages of the effort to be able to process all the information.
Asked what’s going to happen in five years, Schmidt said: “I want Google to be able to answer questions like ‘What to do tomorrow?’ or ‘What would be the job that best suits me?’ – however, the software won’t be able to answer seemingly simple questions as long as there isn’t enough user information.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their browsing on the Network the keywords searched for, the IP addresses and the pages where they passed at the end of the search are accurately stored.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-check what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic will be based on the Recommendations, on which the system will provide us with products and services on the basis of preference.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who worry about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is an already confirmed fact that they not only preserve, but in justifiable cases also assign to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government the information from its website, called Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
On the other hand, Internet users who care about people’s rights, in May, were relieved when the company along with the EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated to the court that he was right in his litigation with the FBI: according to the ruling, Google will not be required to be forced to do so by any of its points.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to get its pretext of reinforcing the child protection law passed years ago, about fifty thousand Web addresses and a thousand searched phrases, but without getting the individual user search lists, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory to the opinion about Google: it is criticized by those who are afraid to supply their personal data because they think their privacy, their private life is damaged when they start using Google services, and they rebel against it as against conservative multinational companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, Internet users and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not so their rival, Microsoft, cataloged by their Windows as the conqueror of the World, no matter how much they both struggle for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and looks younger, more collaborative than the official software giant’s practice.
But it can also be because geeks accurately see the very problematic relationship between people’s rights and the Internet that was produced precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: the Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and can even combine them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, then these can include them in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also have a blog in which they automatically re-appear on the Fli website.
We can know numerous cases from which it turns out that for example the bride, when seeing the stream of photographs of the next morning of ordinary friends, finds out who spent the night before her fraudulent boyfriend or can fire the employee of a company because he writes his honest opinion in his blog about the direction of the company, one thing is deprived of himself.
A person’s “on-line” life is what she shows for herself – this is the definition that hides behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to evade Google’s monopoly, can do it (starting for example with the Scroogle that uses Google’s search engine, but leaves no footprints).
There are many people who don’t want to sign up on the collective pages to prevent them from finding them, but they can replace Google’s “on-line” apps, from text-writing software to image and news-reading apps with alternative versions that don’t connect to giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
Public opinion expects almost openly the day Google shows its true face.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms threaten the revenue of Microsoft advertising agencies, while services that are increasingly heavily software-introduced do not quickly cause it.
Critical observers, however, will find the discrepancies alarming as well: for example, senior management vehemently rejected employee protest after doubling the price of the company’s childcare, considered too expensive the unlimited number of employees’ food, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in the year 2006 the government did not pay the fine and the government did not pay the fine.
One of the company’s internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it is ready to work, which if it is certain that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to reignite the world: while some believe that the project of scanning and archival books and magazines of Google will be able to acquire such dimensions for you, I will be able to use them for you, I will buy them for you.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, can provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scrooged, Cory Doctorow’s popular novel, describes in Orwellian form that future, in which a man only from Google’s data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped clear the marks of the author of the double murder of the city of <0xC3><0x93>zd.
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ozd who, according to a well-founded suspicion, helped clear the traces of the crime, the spokesman for the Borsod province's General Public Order Office said on Tuesday.
The young women acknowledged the crime they were charged with, and they are currently accused of perpetrators of the crime.
The two children - according to the Hungarian news agency, these are two girls - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of <0xC3><0x93>zd's double murder - a 23-year-old man - has been in pretrial detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The accused did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he quoted his creditor at the headquarters of a company in <0xC3><0x93>zd, where he killed him and then also killed the victim’s 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI reports, the young man prepared much earlier to commit the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the crime scene.
The police examine with an expert the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, even though the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state that within a few months wants to sell 60 percent of them.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the Polish offer has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far they have offered the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche B<0xC3><0xB6>rse.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that in the future the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts calculate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a participation of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Bank Cesk<0xC3><0xA1> Sporitelna with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The major European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the ever-deepening international financial crisis speak of a "second September 11".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the president of the United States - according to La Repubblica de Rome - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the hastily-made bill, whose goal is to give a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", of which billionaire investor Warren Buffett spoke, it is more correct to speak of a "second September 11".
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo’s view, the mistake of the political direction of the United States was the one that led the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. monetary system is growing and this will then affect the entire world.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air – just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
This threat cannot be ignored - says the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still throw a life-sustaining belt at financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
But if as the dominoes break down more banks yet, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
The long-term need for EU member states to put aside their nationalistic selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis received just over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion on Monday – recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that there are growing concerns that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not taken seriously the crisis that is going on as a downturn for the Old Continent.
The “salvators” will not have to present immediately hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayers’ funds to avoid a major evil?
The smart car imitates the flight of the beekeeper
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of existing obstacle sensors in nature?
For example, the beekeepers.
In a surprising project presented at Japan’s CEATEC, the beehives provided the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the nature-imitating BR23C robotic steering system, which was given the characteristics of the beehives, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can evade all collisions.
During the flight each beehive creates its own oval private space that actually looks a lot like our safety protective capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of RP and development and research.
An important role is played by the compound eyes of the beekeepers who are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, the engineers used the laser beam length measurement system.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at a 180-degree angle, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the vehicle's microprocessor that immediately transforms into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the beekeepers, modifies the direction by turning the wheels to the extent necessary.
Unlike any existing system today, this maneuver is entirely instinctive.
“If not, the vehicle robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a beekeeper does to avoid other beekeepers.
This process should be done in an open and closed eye.
However, unlike beekeepers, movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for the beekeepers to dodge other beekeepers, here they only used rotational movement and acceleration as a possibility for the auto robot.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and higher in energy density, which means they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the ability to process data, much less that of storage.
This apparatus in every second should only process some input signals and react as the case may be.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
No memory of gigabytes or megabytes is needed.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately evade obstacles, which according to Nissan’s calculations, within ten years will be able to be incorporated into the series-manufactured models.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to their destination, avoiding the existing obstacles on their way.
He's got a name for this pretty boy.
The written version of the $700 billion bailout bill has been prepared, which will be applied in several phases in order to buy bad credit from banks.
In the first phase, half of the money will be spent.
According to eastern coast schedule during new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement around the $700 billion bailout package in total, after several days of discussion, Reuters reported.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. Congress, saying it was only necessary to formalize the agreement in a document.
The commitment made on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking on the outcome of the commitment said: this program will work and will be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about giving it back to the car of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (i.e. before 2 a.m. Monday, according to Central Europe time), without causing a spectacular jump in the exchanges.
On the bill called the Emergency Law for Economic Stabilization of 2008, Monday will first vote for the U.S. Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made overnight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy low-quality credit fund securities.
Now you can only spend half of the $700 billion, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy credit fund securities, of poor rating and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president’s decision.
This program will be controlled by a special body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion could be spent after a new congressional decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad credits, mortgages and credit fund securities, as well as other “poisonous” type credits as well.
The purchase can be made at auctions or in direct form - the competent people of the ministry reported.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated: The law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which can even reach $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, be it the purchase of bad financial means, its insurance or the prevention of risks that could lead to the collapse of some major financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it," he added.
Instead, the heads of the banks who are in trouble and are waiting for state aid will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which the American argot simply calls gold parachute.
Only in certain cases will the payments be limited, in addition the limitations depend on the form of assistance of the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys as part of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on gold parachutes, unless the bank’s failing chief retires.
By directly buying bad credit, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that the bosses’ compensations are not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme.
This is the first case in U.S. history that will be in effect a legal limitation on the revenue of CEOs – said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Congressional Commission, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the participating banks in the program, thus reducing the risk of the taxpayers, since in the end they will even be able to earn profits with the transaction as soon as the economy and with it the bank recovers.
According to the bill over the next five years, the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to return taxpayers’ losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their reservations regarding the project.
“This is not what we were ordered by American citizens, that is, taxpayers’ dollars are not being protected,” said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, said: “The measures urged the same ones who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 percent compared to last month’s prices and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007’s prices – the Central Bureau of Statistics (KSH) reported.
Industrial export prices rose by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to the previous year.

Internal sales prices in the processing industry sectors rose by a minimum of 0.1 percent compared to the month of July.
The biggest increase in price volume occurred in August 2008, in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 percent), due primarily to the 4.6 percent monthly increase in bags and belts and the 2.5 percent increase in footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical production branch (1.6 percent).
There was a decrease in price in the petrochemical sector, (1.4 percent), in the production of electric machines and instruments (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 percent).
The prices of papermaking, publishing and printing did not change.
In the rest of the sectors of the processing industry there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water that represent a significant weight within domestic trade, an increase of 0.3 percent was recorded in August, primarily as a result of the effect of the increase in official prices from the first of July.
In a 12-month period - in national sales of the processing industry sectors - the largest increase in prices was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 percent).
In the metal processing sector, there was a 13.2 percent increase, while in the food, beverage and tobacco industry, of decisive weight, there was an 11 percent increase.

In the consumer goods producing branches, a decrease of 6.8 per cent and in investment goods by 1.4 per cent was recorded.
Industry export prices calculated in HUF increased by 1.1 percent compared to the previous month, and compared to 12 months, there was a decrease of 3.9 percent.
The price of our national currency in one month decreased by 1.7 percent against the euro and by 7.1 percent against the dollar, compared to August 2007 it strengthened by 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Will next year no longer need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga G<0xC3><0xB6>ncz believes there are many possibilities for the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement to come into force around January 12 – the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, before the Hungarians living there.
In his opinion, “practically everything depends on building the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic in time.”
At the same time, he warned that in the new system the entry premise will disappear, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin will have to register.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will interview Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by handing over the Median Cross to the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the banks’ financial bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties on Sunday secured their support for the administration’s $700 million banking aid program, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon-style negotiations, announced early Sunday: a principle agreement was reached on the banks’ financial bailout package.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and unfreezing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, by putting economic issues first, Obama regained a certain edge and disappeared McCain’s advantage that he had gained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin’s candidacy for vice president.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the proposal includes those points of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
“We have to act now and responsibly ... employment, savings from you and entire industries and the stability of the entire economy are at risk,” he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not take advantage of the opportunity to call McCain’s economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained that “we will all take this to heart ... but doing nothing is simply not a viable path.”
The Republican senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a control committee for the Minister of Fines and the limitation of the compensation of the executives, who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, instead he consulted with the minister daily.
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that lawmakers are likely to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press magazine of the German speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious voters – claims Der Spiegel about the weak election result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a Red coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Devotes its Parents" he analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took over.
The social Christians for several decades were developing in Bavaria – and now these modern citizens are the ones who turn their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that had been predicted for almost ten years: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU achieved 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during Stoiber’s so-called era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the rate they were very wrong. However, the secularization, the results of the education and settlement of the Germans of the North in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the voters of the CSU.
With modernisation, the possibilities are also increased and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious, most critical, and most stubborn voters.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks it was just the conventional groups of citizens who moved further away from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, those who have a bachelor’s degree and the diplomats.
Less than 40 percent of support for the CSU was denied.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative newspaper of Vienna: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved in matters of coalition" - deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open in all directions to negotiate, while the Greens still do not want to consult on the coalition.
Elections have already been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, party leaders have barely seen anything of their jackets.
Werner Faymann, the SP<0xC3><0x96> president, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman has left the question that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, in the position of vice-chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapprove of the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>ssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said the cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
It is still open in the party whether they will elect the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must certainly be discussed, within the <0xC3><0x96>VP itself.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> President J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider was open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to assume the responsibility of the government,” Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has started in Paris, its host is France which this year is also the rotating president of the European Union.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in her message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that strike the Gypsy children and is also the biggest obstacle to their predominant interest.
This high-level conference was inaugurated - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights organisations.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka - according to the press bureau of the Fidesz group of MEPs in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are left out of the labour market in the first place because of their low level of education.
“Most young Gypsies have not finished middle school and because of the poor quality of basic education, only a small part can get a university degree.”
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka also pointed out that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the predominant foundation of other human rights as well.
Investing in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these issues widely among both the Gypsies and non-Gypsies.
For the earlier a giant student starts school, the more likely he will be to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
“Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be assured of the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education,” said L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
According to the MEP, it is necessary for the objective and active unity of the European Union to immediately accelerate the processes of school segregation, which is why it is of fundamental importance to correctly comply with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
“We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer the Roma children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens,” J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka demanded.
The aim of the European Summit for Equality of Opportunities, organised annually since last year’s Berlin meeting held in the sign of the “European Year of Equality of Opportunities”, is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, a decision will be made on the fate of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein.
Despite the severe electoral defeat, no heads have yet been cut off at the tops of the Bavarian CSU, for the time being the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, party president and G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in office, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The duo’s fate, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the party’s extraordinary congress to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the much-criticized duo let in: they don’t hold on to their positions so much.
In doing so, they sought to reassure the angry members of their parliamentary group and their grassroots organization, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago – although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career – the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the blow against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had a “monopoly” in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the province of the South, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to predominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to make a coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the party’s restructuring, Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, one of Huber’s possible successors, also holds a position in the small intelligence group that initiates negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Voters on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about the fate is that in the list of Free Voters that Gabriele Pauli enters parliament, whose action against Stoiber was taken for the blow of the Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelly erased from the stage to the ambitious local politics.
The top CSU leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, Stoiber will also be given an active role that until now has been moving the strings in the background, the former provincial head of government and former president of the CSU called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the fraternal party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor unless they are able to highlight together the CSU that played a crucial role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel that she could hardly hide her disappointment at failure, the losses of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great Berlin coalition.
Which of course is relative: it will not be easier to treat the wounded CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After the elections on Sunday, there will be no opposition MP in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability it guarantees in the country Alexander Lukashenko, instead according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is better explained by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
Although the legislature of the country of 10 million inhabitants, composed of one percent and ten deputies, has no opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) expected that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of the
Thus the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that it originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly dependent on Russia - which took a credit to moderate Russia's increasingly expensive natural gas imports and which contributed to the sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, owner of the pipeline passing through the country - considered that it did not want to improve its relations with the European Union.
It was a sign of dissatisfaction when the OSCE, when evaluating the election campaign, put emphasis rather on positive phenomena rather than errors – such as the ban on tax participation of a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE’s primary report on Monday even criticized the campaign itself – in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press – and especially that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
With all this in the opposition’s view, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia – with which Belarus is theoretically already a federal state – is a two-month-old state.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun," Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to maintain this situation, even though "the regime is afraid to allow the entry of even an opponent in that weightless parliament".
The opposition does not plan to organize protests by seeing the results, rather it tries to get voters their message about the need for economic reforms.
"This obviously causes us a lot of problems because we have to print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties in their distribution, but even so I see that more and more people are supporting the change among the older ones as well," Milinkevich said, referring to the regime of Lukashenko, who believes that the main outcome is not the self-confidence.
Because of the country’s debt and the rising trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security that “looks like the silence of cemeteries,” Milinkevich said.
The Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, described the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in facts", so that the lack of opposition is nothing more than the testimony of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on you'll have more breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that they set automatic doors to control the entry and exit of staff.
but from today it starts with this measure against who signs up and then goes to the bar to have a coffee on working hours.
This news has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
“Automated doors – says Brunetta – are an instrument for working better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services,” he said.
“Now a new season of responsibility and transparency is opening up.
This is Reformism," Brunetta said.
With Palacio Chigi the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
There has been no resistance on the part of the employees, says the Secretary-General: "it has been a change shared by the workers and there has been collaboration on the part of them."
In short, no more breakfast on business hours; no more coffee and mid-months.
Brunetta’s words, which he suggests, smiling, “a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand.”
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
“In three months the absences of disease from public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is to say 60,000 more people at work in a year.”
And he adds that it is necessary to make public administration more effective
Italy, “which wage dynamics – explains the minister – in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above the inflation rate.”
For now, millions of public employees have joined forces to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the Codacons-backed petition.
“As the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the lowest absence of work due to disease – writes the association of consumers – the people of the ‘vague workers’ is constantly increasing.
There are indeed millions of correct and productive public administration employees in Italy who have come together to declare war on the illegitimate norms of the decree.”
In particular, the Tar challenged the exclusion of economic treatments added by disease due to service; the extension of the time slots in which the medical check-ups of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
By 2007, Inail data actually confirmed that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the leading causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates the 58th national day for victims of work accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October in all provinces of Italy.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association mutilated and disabled by the work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant associative effort in favour of prevention in the workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and awareness raising of public opinion".
“It has been manifested, a ‘enough’, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, by their dimensions, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, but the everyday reality proposes us dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that “there is undoubtedly a resource problem: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives promoted in the field of education are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm about social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative rules.
For his part, the Speaker of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined commitment to urgently put an end to it".
“The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not take away from the fact that the number of white deaths is equally impressive,” said Anmil Pietro Mercandelli, president of the company.
“We don’t really want this ‘decreasing trend’ to translate into less attention, because it’s precisely when the attention decreases that exploits the tragedy.
“We believe that at the overall level too little is still done to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
“We need, at our discretion, greater controls and inspections, but also stronger intervention on workers’ training, and this from the school world.”
"There is a further effort - he has added - in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration in the level of subsidiary protection provided for victims of work" and the "assistance drift towards which the system has been heading in recent years".
“The goal is to give back to the worker the insurance guarantee because the fate of the person who is injured does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator each time.”
Mp3 Readers Accused, Put Hearing at Risk
Listening to high volume music for a long period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
The European Commission, in a statement released in Brussels, cites the opinion of the EU Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risk (Csrseri), published today.
“From this scientific opinion – it is read in the note – it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the high volume device risk a permanent loss of hearing ability.”
“I’m concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and high-acoustic cell phones can unconsciously damage their ears in an irremediable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“From the scientific evidence – the EU’s responsibility – emerges a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What matters is to raise awareness of consumers and make this information public.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and step-by-step with the new technology.”
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that it causes.
“Scientists confirm that this is a cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine, together with Member States and stakeholders, what measures could eventually be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices.”
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as the hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to severely limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and the exposure time to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limit on maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
It means that 5-10% of users of such devices are affected and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the schedule set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which has been set up this morning at its new headquarters behind the Termas de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will deliberate on the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the council and the municipal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official ball" of the Municipality and its intendant Gianni Alemanno.
“The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to underline Alemanno – it must provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the city council and the city council, can then step down.
There is no spare role position, just the willingness to have a place to draw up a great project for Rome.
In March, the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise timeline.
In June – announces the Intendant – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome.”
To whom the Commission accuses of uselessness, given that its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Almost always politics is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that are manifested back and forth.
On the contrary, we want to look beyond and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.”
“This Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, does not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to involve and reason the best minds expressed by the capital.”
For Alemanno, in effect, “it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic level jump, of which we have absolute need, thinking with a unitary spirit about its future.”
A future that, the Rome Intendant says, "was not limited only to the current municipal boundaries but looked beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but also "considering the role that Rome can and should develop as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He has written an American political note that he is interested in going through independently: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and tube relations (as he does today also gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A Miami woman wrote on a Web site: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great face: he believes he will win the highest office in the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!”
In reality, they are attacks that don’t say much; they are attacks of a clearly racial nature and don’t answer voters’ question: Will he be a good president? And there are polls; everyone says Obama will win and with a good lead.
Also in this case there is one who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the booth to vote we will know well who will vote for the American patriot.
One side of the U.S. mentality is covered to the last.
“Say whatever you want, we’ll think about where to put the cross, whether it’s Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasoning, the winning weapon for Democrats is George Bush.
They have asked 1,500 people: what have been the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89 percent have answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent her home to kicks in the ass.
In Iraq, there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to pack their bags.
Iraq, for the most part, has been Bush’s weak point.
Whoever assumes the position of George W will have a huge duty to develop.
Uses, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "murderer" of the paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been interviewed by PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
Today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated like they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as most of the public understand it to be reduced substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is going the wrong way.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Impressions against emission.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many seen as the "murderer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in hopes of “doing something good” by journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between who runs the newspapers – that is, the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56% of national executives are sure their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage is down to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “work safety.”
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationally.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of “take it or leave it”.
Directors almost always get good salaries, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social insurance.
For holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But U.S. journalists, by his admission, “sickened” later in the year.
It is all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: ROME TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPOLA QUEDA IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the anti-aggression pact Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the arrest process, last week, he obtained the home release, turning it into a mandatory residence to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to travel the route from the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (by which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuse him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already emerged a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million bailout plan put in place by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were, and this one, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
The New York Times gives us a confirmation yesterday informing us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, increasingly divided among its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the other hand, conservative, hostile to “those of Washington” and the state of finance in the center.
The soul, in fact, has become prepotent with the vote of the one who spoke at the beginning.
This barely quoted is just an example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here alone.
Both in the United States and in Europe for a long time the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-update, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double category state-sovereignty in relation to a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions – it would finance those who have, yes, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all are much more committed to the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state.
The one that immediately creates a political problem for the one who governs it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of the question or has little to say: the crucial test is the European Union, which, as always, is divided between the different interests and the different state strategies, fails to decide any common policy.
It is the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the grant of funds: from the moment it comes to court it is only the state that has the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market and no organization can possibly ever have to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will have to do more and more with the less immaterial things like water, crops and oil instead.
All things that, you see, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are equally united in absolute form in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself as a sovereign certainly has many more letters about who he is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty, but it predates a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, of a proven economic kind, is inadequate with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the Western countries in an increasing number.
It seems to move more and more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far in height, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the term, to have made the time itself and to be stranger to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a few words, subterraneanly feeds a branched but powerful movement that has been delegitimizing the ruling classes and the traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an electoral "revolt" or in the sudden changes of collective moods of recent times, from the conservative to the conservative in Austria-Berno-Berves
It has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say some, make it ever more difficult to understand and then to represent, what is taking shape from today are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis is growing again and again.
In the face of all this, talking about a “mass rebellion” today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open is certainly not.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spider-Man.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come close enough.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to stick a 100-kilogram body onto a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones using a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the feet of geckos, coated with microscopic hairs that can assure the animal a perfect adherence.
Tests done on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time “it easily takes off from the walls,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the engineering faculty at Dayton University.
"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through the walls exactly like Spider-Man? Layers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications may have to do with aerospace engineering.
There are no superheroes at the moment.
The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of micro fibers as hair that self-cleans itself from dust while moving on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in the summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken concurrently with some drugs their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing as the case may be, efficiency with serious health consequences.
Repeating the risk of fruit juices are packaged that fresh ones associated with the intake of some medicines David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in progress to Philadelphia sends a new alarm: I just put a jar of apple juice, apple juice and orange juice into the pot.
Grapefruit juice was already under indictment because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological drugs.
The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a news bulletin two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to pay attention to what you drink in case you are taking a drug such as Diasepam or El Metado.
Not Just the Pomegranate – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan, said: “These discoveries are generally pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes of the same.
That’s why you should always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us impress, ask the doctor or pharmacist clearly,” said the expert of the agency Ansa.
The Economics Novel by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies, his business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Keynesian Neo who teaches at Princeton University and is a noted New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s decisions regarding the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attack, in those days that Enron broke down, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the United States.
A prediction that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years was blamed on the economy, but that has now turned out to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and a little upset that the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from public attention,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European Central Bank’s executive committee, Krugman is a “high-value economist,” but also a publicist with a “very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses of the liberalism of the Bush administration.”
Open Office, echo the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the personal productivity open source suite that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year’s work by volunteer developers, whose backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: to the welcome screen and to the less bulky magazine interface, more consistent ones are added, such as the compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, the new Dopento X and the support for the new OS X.
Attention also put to the multifunction with the 2007 Office suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx,.xlsx,.pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it electronically, or the possibility to import the PDF file into the graphics processing module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create "Hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of modifications, in the drafting of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to that for Windows and Mac OS, as normally the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can also be sent on request at home or at work.
And if the free theme can be a hook for home broadcasting, it is in the business field that Open Office suite proves, it tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects carried out in public administration and in schools.
And there are not even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospects could be opened up.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the worksheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint presentation; Dbase, eat in the case of the known Access is the program that consents to work in the database; and finally Draw the graph.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that so far we have reached almost 3 million 600,000, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Kohl also found positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case in the Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third ranked and winner of the best ladder of the climber.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26 years old, is the fourth positive runner to the third generation Ep, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also those of the Gerolsteiner.
Analysis of Kohl's blood champions is among those conducted in recent weeks in the labs of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the evidence confirms that it is positive, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and rage against the two-year canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl’s positive doping at the third-generation Ep is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the news to Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, winning the prize for the best climber.
INMIGRANTES: NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION, ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy as an emigrant country has only recently been transformed into a privileged destination for “hostile immigrants”.
That’s what the New York Times asks in a long article that has devoted to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a cookie box.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the “paradise of the north”: the northern regions are at the same time those where “more integration and more work” are recorded but also the country’s highest anti-immigrant sentiment and the highest support of the Northern League.”
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also, the new legislation wanted by the League tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegals is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
A trend marked by the Pope that by the President of the Republic: “Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI in Congress has asked the state and the church to work together to combat racism.”
Student victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for college students is not aware of the crisis.
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the union of tenants, renting an individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study to a large part of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to sustain - explains the head of the office of studies of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand has completely deformed the market to such an extent to trigger a general increase."
Apart from that in most cases the rental offers contain a number of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, no canon limit, sub-rentals linked.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the revision of the tax, can regulate prices.
Looking in detail at the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for an individual room from a minimum of 650 (Black Band area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for one bed in a double room and 370 to 500 for one individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bolonia) they ask you about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas near other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
Economy is made only if the peripheral area is changed: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for an individual room in Prenestina, Centocelle and the surrounding area.
In Naples, 300/450 euros for one bed is used, for one room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari you can get 250/350 euros for one bed, at least 350 euros for one individual.
in the cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the city's economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of student and extra-community rentals is more frequent, there is another anomaly: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to foreign students compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradise, the cities cancel the historic rooms
The historical cinemas close in favor of the Multiplex.
“A city without movie theaters in a blind city is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively captures what is happening in the large Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticons on the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
They are almost always historical places, full of memory,"it's as if a friend, a acquaintance with whom a piece of place was shared and so much emotion", observes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won the cousin Oscar and the grand jury prize in Cannes, which always counted for the poetry of a cinema of a cinema.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of traders, speak clearly: in the last five years have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay the most are mainly the rooms of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are Emilia-Romagna with 82 fewer cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the person responsible for its disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these three Italian regions have registered the largest number of new methic cinemas: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” notes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, “it would be useful for new structures to be built but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all of its fans are willing to transfer to the meticons.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of traders: the state’s previous debt is approximately 10 million euros.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year.”
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to worry about the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono room in the historical center as well as in the periphery.
Among the planned rules, there are mediums of tax facilitation for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for parking.
“It’s an initiative I like,” notes Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna’s example by setting other measures.
It is true, that to contrast the extra power of the meticons, the traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a topic that was always important to me: the closure of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to perform the "New Paradise cinema", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass through the already closed Rialto or the Quirinale via Nazionale, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so as not to see the signs blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side.”
Link between politics and 'drangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the municipal elections for those interested in the Piromalli cosca".
The charges that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria give to the intendant and vice intendant of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the intendant of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafia association.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, the boss’s name, have already been arrested and sentenced by a mob criminal association to pay 10 million euros.
“Deprecating any legal and moral norms, and of good sense,” the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with attorney Piromalli.
"It would have been allowed the mafia family - the judges write - to officially enter the interior of the municipality facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "a deal between organized bad life is a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the deal is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the ‘drangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean.’
This morning’s arrests are added to those last July after police had announced the head cut of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the charge of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chief of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, after the ballot in May 2006, had been elected as head of a centre-right coalition.
I exploit a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call into question the deputy interior minister who at the time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of organizing everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even requested the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, “the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, emerges, uniforming the elections of the public administration on the interests of the mafia families.”
When energy is born from the waves, the big ones come down on stage.
It is an extinct site that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources that greats like Chevron look upon.
The possibility of collecting energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s along with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of low oil, in 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was separated, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
London’s World Energy Council (WEC) has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of sea waves.
This amount would be twice as much as that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would be currents and tides.
Giants to attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in Northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and among these companies who have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying technology on ocean energy – said a spokesman for a company associated with the US oil giant to the Wall Street Journal – and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question is about obtaining permission from the U.S. Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a pretty important signal, if considered that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to make new drilling.
In addition to Chevron is New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power to follow the path of the energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about a technology still at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts such as those of the Portuguese or the Scots are small in size and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of good ties between them.
The force of the waves, which moves the good ones up and down becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure rotates a turbine which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
For now, there are four such implants in development, pending only federal approval, other than energy, could serve as a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping center and for a parking lot, using underwater turbines on the East River in New York.
The movement of water when there are tides, rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electric Energy, at this time deserves the potential of the tides.
While this is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
It is mainly about tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others approaching the shores, have invested $7 million in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
