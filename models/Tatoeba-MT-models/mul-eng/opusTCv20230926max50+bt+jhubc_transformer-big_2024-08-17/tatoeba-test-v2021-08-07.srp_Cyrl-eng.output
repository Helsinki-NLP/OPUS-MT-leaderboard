You're sad.
You're sad.
You're so skinny.
You're the boss.
You're the boss.
You're too young.
You're too young.
You're too young.
You're very immature.
You're very rude.
You're on TV again instead of working from home.
I know as much as you do.
Your house is big.
Your shoes are here.
Your time will come soon.
Your will is a command for me.
You said you were ready.
“You talk too much,” he said.
And you, Brutus?
YouTube videos are very unsatisfactory.
You underestimate me.
You have a dirty imagination.
You have no idea how right you are.
To him, buried cheese.
