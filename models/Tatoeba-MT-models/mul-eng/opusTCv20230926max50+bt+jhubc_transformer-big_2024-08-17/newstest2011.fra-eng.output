What's going to happen? CSSD does not know either Voldemort or pastries in Prague.
CSSD’s newly elected mayors in the capital will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand themselves at the municipal council level with their former and new SDG colleagues.
The newspaper Actualne.cz has "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the argot that was born in recent years in the town hall, when they were the partners of the current coalition that were leading in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague’s political cream set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was with surprise that it was discovered that the new elected officials did not quite understand the terms known.
At least they say so.
“Who is Valdemort?”
“I really don’t know.”
"I am a youth in Prague politics," Lukas Kaucky, the culture-educated candidate for the test of the "paranoid" vocabulary, responded.
And as for the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of “golf hole”.
"It's the only expression among those that you propose to me that I use."
Otherwise, I don't use argot.
From the vocabulary, whose daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-election congress of the ODS, the editorial team chose 6 examples, primarily those related to the Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", going to the pastry shop", "beef nerf", "trafficking the capital" and "stalking".
Three of the electors agreed for the quiz, the fourth- Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek squarely refused the test.
“I don’t care at all about these things here and how the representatives of civil democracy are having fun: I won’t give my opinion.”
“I’m currently working on how we’re going to understand ourselves as part of our programs,” he said.
As has already been heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the legend above, that it is the Janousek influence on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky said, adding immediately, "but I know the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he joked.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the chosen for the environment, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two social democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of "going to the bakery".
“It’s about, I think, going into a company,” Plachy is ready to guess that it’s the headquarters of Janousek’s companies.
On the same note, Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather than from the newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the test candidates, there is no lexicon of arg<0xC3><0xB4>t in social democracy.
“I’ve consulted with colleagues and it turns out that we really don’t have something like that.”
“It’s more like names sometimes used abbreviations and symbols,” said Peter Hlinsky, president of the Socio-Democratic Party, whom Party members call Hulda.
“I was called Briza at school but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” Brezina admits.
The Daily Actual.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for Party members or the least friendly Petit olde, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by fraud during the party's sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little joke".
Surnames are also the only ones that allow the use of social democrats within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like much to hear Hulda, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in law of matraque" reminds us that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title of doctor in law JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "sorcerers", published a pamphlet.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
They are part of the older generation, cannot work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one that becomes "sorcerer" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
“Man has very rarely this destiny.”
“We also don’t judge healthy young women because they participate in work and give birth to children,” says a sister who works in the West African country’s capital, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He published a booklet that should help limit the hunt for witches.
The case involves a "hic".
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso don’t know how to read,” the daily Die Standard warned of the drawback of written education.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, Burkina Faso’s neighbor, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with the oil they had spilled on her.
It was the BBC’s server that transmitted this information.
The criminals claim that it was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil that serves the ritual onctions ignited the contact of the woman.
The oil flared up, it seems, when the team wanted to "hunt the wrong spirit" of the woman.
Isolation of "sorcery" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The Der Standard daily quoted a 42-year-old Burkina Faso entrepreneur as saying: “Human mind eaters have always been a danger,” he said.
As Burkina Faso strives to reduce witch hunts, the Gambia did not later than last year saw the President himself participate in it.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a large hunt for witches who, it seems, would have participated in his death and would have been forced by black magic to kill the President as well."
“Shots from nearby Guinea came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal custody of the President, of randomly chosen men and women in Gambian villages,” Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, prisoners were required to drink a plant-based potion with hallucinogenic effects that also caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two of the prisoners did not survive.
On the international pressure is about one thousand people who were released.
Bakal’s tenant: The po<0xC3><0xA8>les are warming, he has signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man came out through the door of the customer center of RPG company Byty of the "carbon baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new leases for three apartments: his, his daughter’s and his son’s who is in the process of purging a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to settle from next year for a 2+1 apartment of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works on solid fuel," shows the man who has the power to sign the new contract from his son.
"But I signed it anyway," he explains to the angry motivator and the resigned half.
The citizen association of BytyOKD.cz apartments, which described the bare rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, the date on which a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But man reacts to this by a gesture of the hand.
"One said this, the other said something else", frowning at the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not match the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09:00 in the morning.
Right next to the door stands a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
A single pressure and a paper with a number coming out of the device.
You don't have time to read your "157" number as your number is already starting to light up on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems as everywhere - demand for repairs, events related to insurance and others.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving mails with new leases in their mailbox since around mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rental increases of 15 to 38 percent.
the special ticket for new rentals has been open to the public since November 18.
"It's been running for almost a week, so it's still on the test," the employee replies, after a moment of hesitation, behind the window when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The deragulation and old apartments of minors of Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of the parliament and native of the Ostrava region Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social-Democrats reported this quite well before the elections and this now fills the local newspapers.
“Twenty years later, I want a new floor.”
"They didn't even change a tray in the toilet, relieved in the introduction of the man mentioned.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to make sure they will receive a refund on the new rental price if they sign now as promised by RPG in a special offer.
It is a rebate of half the amount of the rent that will be received by the other tenants who will have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" window of Havirovaska street is really not overwhelmed by the questions.
“Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent,” says the employee at the counter.
And yet RPG poses both on its website and in the windows of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on the lease, it is an independent court that will take the decision.
“It’s not about threats, it’s just about informing us about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,” RPG said on its website.
"Nobody's going to court here" thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and the man in the street in front of the customer center gives him reason.
“I have 13,000 crowns of retirement and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don’t have enough to go to court,” he said.
The employee suddenly feels uneasy.
"Nous verrons".
“Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore people wait,” she said.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, current rents still do not reach the level necessary for simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that it is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry that the main reason is the increase in rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest 4 billion in apartments with rents, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hung on the ceiling in front of the upholstered chairs of the waiting room of Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
“The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments.”
“And it will always be no more than 7.50 Czech crowns per month,” says the screen.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
“In these cases, it is an increase of a really very low sum of 19.66 Czech crowns per m2,” adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see the graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement are given priority.
The kindergarten is also part of offices that included the architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint of Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini kindergarten with everything you need - color walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of the employees of Arch. design can go there.
The architectural projects company Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its small business school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
She employs about 90 people, especially from the age of having children, and she cared that women architects and project managers could quickly get back to work.
At the same time as reduced-time work contracts, the kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Manufacturers and architects thus have the opportunity to combine a work taking care of children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who imagined this kindergarten and with the support of the management they were able to obtain a staffing from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The kindergarten is funded through the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme for Human Resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding (up to 2.8 mil Czech crowns), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and after two years provide qualified personnel as well as start-up.
After the use of the funding staff (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and it was the company Economy rating that helped to make the request for staffing.
Child care is provided by qualified staff, all day long a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of children. children can go to kindergarten without age limit but they have more than three ans for most.
As it is a "mini-mother school" there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more that are replaced.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school regardless of the hierarchical position.
Although it is individual care and education, the program of the mini kindergarten is comparable to that of preschool education.
Children do not only play there but quality education is also ensured there - from the beginning until preparation to the school benches we teach English.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can control their child at any time and not have the stress of a delay to go looking for children in a school away from the parents' workplace.
Parents use their work time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer is created.
Arch.Design.s is thus listed among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for recruiting new employees and who are family-friendly and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The house in bones fascinates even after 100 years. Take a look inside Gaudi.
The toy looks like the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase to a dinosaur spine, and the balconies to open fish bowls.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received from the locals the nickname "House in Bone".
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is typical of Antoni Gaudi’s New Art.
The front fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the house unfolds its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
In the course of a more detailed observation we see the geometry, the rhythm and the order thought with precision.
At night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced by it.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood in waves copies the window frames, balustrades, decorative elements of the doors, the eyelash and the lamellas.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at number 43, was born from the construction of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on demolishing the old building and building another brand new one but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-dwelling house was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade were born.
Other artists and creators have also worked for the facade.
The joint work for the plans of the Casa Battlo house began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The locals nicknamed the warm house just after it was finished because of its organic forms "the House in Bone".
Others, given the specific mechanism of opening the windows, called it "the house that dances".
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of the construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Their inclination of 45 degrees seems strange.
During the creation of Gaudi absolutely did not comply with the construction guidelines of the time and did not let themselves be hindered by them.
At the beginning of construction he obtained permission from the city to build, knowing, of course, that the data carried on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the municipal council was horrified and requested modifications.
He did not like, for example, the members of the municipal council that the pillars of construction are plying on the public sidewalk.
There was never a change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the city's appeal Josep Battlo requested (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which one can access up to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of linking spaces.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the salons and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi received in addition new facades a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi’s play with light is also impressive, with blue and white glass tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with light wells.
The two-color game gives a maximum of light in all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark, which on the contrary absorbs the sun’s rays.
The Casa Battlo house that was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and the most beautiful apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to pass this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found it to be a lucrative business and they expanded the field of visits to the common spaces and the barn including the toy terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is not really expensive and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entry price into the other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic towers, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a sink: women have different criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for the bed, so the mattress and somnolence give a real basis for a good bed.
Of course, they must complement each other harmoniously in order to please a particular user.
During the choice several things are decisive: weight, size, age, health status as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which you will place the mattress and the sink is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where you do not sleep continuously latex mattresses are not appropriate because they "heat" gently.
In addition, they have a weight greater than the standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mold can also form there.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
One who spends the light of time abroad where very thick mattresses are often used with a crumbling layer, will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
“That’s how all the hockey players who come back from NHL complain that they can’t sleep there.”
“For their tired shoulders, feet, and ribs, they needed mattresses with a crumbling layer of lazy foam.”
“Such mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore misunderstands the “information” of the joints and skin,” explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lax foam conquered the hockey players as well as other customers.
"Today everything is going well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico, for example, have appropriate mattresses.
You don’t need to be an NHL guy to be able to enjoy a lazy foam.
This “miracle” just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won’t go back in the night like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
The laxative foam also works as a protection against squares.
For the choice of mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180 cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each one for a double bed should be 90 cm or in total 180 cm.
For single beds in one place, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It is convenient when visiting.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands comfortably with the slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Brokers-Matelassiers and Decorators, who has been devoting herself to furniture for several years now.
For a two-seater bed each needs its own sommelier and mattress, so be careful during the hustle to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only have to climb the sommelier to different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are required for the shape and aeration layer.
"To touch or in a sitting position on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-defined type of somnolence.
The sommelier bed, when the mattress and sommelier are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; one should not wash it, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night we normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and thick) sieve.
For this reason, specialists refuse to make a claim for a lifespan of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But everything to his mother.
And for this, an experienced advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the coating of the mattress, for hygiene or washing but rather add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even though nowadays it is common to make linings with sliding closure for the whole, that is to say that after opening one has two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the manipulation for the large models (and for a single pull of the knife) from the
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a pillowcase?
Never!
Maximum for one bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are no) with air holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with pockets springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an air layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-position lamellar sinks with 14/18 lamellar, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more lamellar, 28 and above, so that the lamellar can be folded into the lower part
For multi-position mattresses it is not necessary to take spring mattresses because it does not respond to position changes.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the lamellae, it is also possible to install what is called a shoulder cradle.
This is a special connection of the lamellae which allows to make pressure even to tilt the lamellae so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back", it's really an important thing.
This is already being considered by mattress manufacturers who for "masculine" began to use a slumping area at the level of the shoulders.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are winged or plated sommeliers with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure spreads to more points and dilates the voltage.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated with air) on good mattresses and sleepers, the "plus" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow should support the head and its tips should only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm which Scandinavians prefer for example.
When lying on the side, the pillow should upgrade the height of the shoulders (with the shoulder cradle of the sleeper or the area rolled into the mattress).
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first straw and grass-based ones.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also in organic mattress.
The petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is made, are replaced by natural oils, such as soy oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use exactly soy.
“The Bio qualification for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products,” says Petr Vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for coatings of mattresses; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavender scents.
There are differences between men and women.
While extracting birch plants so that the coating of the mattress absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood flow and is therefore warmer for low sex.
Current favourites?
The mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cell structure therefore more breathable than the standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foam gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, bottom of the back and feet are located.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached the first place.
Saving for mattress and somnolence is not easy.
From time to time, special actions by manufacturers or producers may have two mattresses for the price of one.
As for example the company Magniflex which offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course you can take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic mousses with an open cell structure and a great thickness was started with the Tempur material at a "cosmic" pace.
This began as material for NASA because the astronauts were subjected to the start of huge charge factors.
The Tempur slumped back to the heat and hardened, on the contrary, to the cold.
It therefore perfectly adapts to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
It is ideal for this against bad sleep and for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and the venous system.
For example, Czech manufacturers use EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly being asked by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear of their child leads more and more people to think about watching them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can just as well be used to track the movement of people and help in some cases as for example that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a box of lighters but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka has moved a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
“We’re trying to tell everyone that this is not espionage but just another way to lessen the likelihood of another tragedy,” said Petr Pilin of MACRO Weil, one of the Czech market’s leading providers of tracking devices.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of someone who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
“Most people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons,” Pilin added.
According to him, children should always know what purpose is used "the box" and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention that if the child does not want to wear such a thing on him, he will get rid of it.
“Even the youngest can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something explicitly when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Mobile phones, which can be cut off like these tracking devices, have already led parents to long-awaited,” Bockova says.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is highly questionable.
"If this is a ready-made robbery, the author will do everything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate it."
“At the moment, it’s the phone.”
"As soon as the tracking devices are developed, they (the criminals) will look for them as well because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
“In such cases, the criminals will always be in advance on the police,” says the psychologist.
It also admits that such devices can help in an attack not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, he claims that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an attack.
"The device may be set in such a way that it is regularly broadcast after a specified period."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, it still remains the last position of the person concerned."
“The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and is in an elongated position without moving,” says Cech.
According to him, so-called smartphones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special software.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn in a pendant the size of a box of lighters or the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
“Or he will realize it after a while, which will have given the police a little more time,” he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to track cars.
This is a combination of a position-acquisition system using GPS (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts a vehicle’s current position.
The army has so many detonating ropes that it could tour the Czech Republic with it, but it can only last two years.
The army bought 445 km of cords used for the explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence purchased 224 km.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of cords is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating cords from the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as a reason for the slaughter of a huge amount of detonating cords to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by the military pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it is clear that even the generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household personnel should have an explosive exercise every year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defense and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating cords.
At this distance is 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army's reserves could support it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals there is enough to more than 2 m of detonating cords, as experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has provided - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the mentioned 225 years.
However, the soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no ammunition for their handguns and that the shooting sessions were limited due to the need for money.
We don't talk about the lack of clothes.
“And I don’t take my head off if they buy so many detonating cords from us.”
“And that’s their decision and they really know what they’re doing.”
“For us the military is a good customer that we as traders strive to please,” says STV Group Chief Commercial Officer Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, argues that hundreds of kilometers of detonating cords will be stolen by the army having these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky of STV Group states that only four years of life of the detonating cords and the pyrotechnicians of the police and army are only two years.
“If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can even take up to four years,” says one of the two who don’t want his name to be published in light of the army’s criticism.
The life span of the past, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains integrated and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the department is a reduction due to the amount of 445 km of cords detonating.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said spokesman Pejsek, who is the buyer's interpreter at the Department of Defense.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating cords of police pyrotechnicians who neutralize World War II munitions or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always only order the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for safety reasons by pyrotechnicians and to be able to obtain more flexible and more modern and reliable types of detonating cords.
Today, the Ministry of Defense has major problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the strong Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move towards the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating cords that it buys today "cheap".
So far, I have been able to make use of the contacts I have gained through the contests.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to become the winner of the Best Individual Entrepreneur contest.
The winner of last year’s Best Individual Entrepreneur contest was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Libérec he lacked a quality hosting site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had gained while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 semi-detached apartments.
Knowing that he was still a student in his third year of higher education, it was a bold action.
“The relationship between the quality and price of accommodation in our region has made me want to do something,” says Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building he converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of almost 300 beds of all types of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year he received another of the same quality.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the hotel franchise Pytloun showed up,” No. 1 of last year’s entrepreneurs said.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the win in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition has served well," Pytloun added with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known to Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very nice,” he recalls.
He recommends participation in this contest to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses his contacts and knowledge to this day that he could not have obtained in any other way.
“With those I met through the competition, I started to maintain regular business relationships.
According to him, the reputation associated with success also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
“I especially observe in their homes the loyalty and pride of being engaged in something that has been generally recognized.”
"It's not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
“Only my name is pushed forward,” says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of the winner's goal Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to look for the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which he transformed a tooling workshop at Ceska Skalice into a firm with sales of 100 million crowns.
“I can say that the award has not only encouraged me but also my collaborators and increased our self-confidence to fight against competition,” said the winner of last year’s competition.
At the beginning of the history of the Farmet company there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of the property by the Communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he was working at the time, and set up a company with a few comrades in the vicinity.
Not long after they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even to the non-specialized public after the success of the competition through the media.
“Not only did our customers start to really get to know the Farmet brand better, but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were collaborating with a company that achieved the greatest success in their home country,” says Karel Zdarsky.
But last year didn’t happen at Farmet just in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the economic results of 2008 and part of 2009.
And in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their scams of new materials and technologies.
“Of course, we didn’t get out of this situation.”
“The turnover has fallen by 40 percent, and we should limit our production and even licensee,” explains Karel Zdarsky.
A sustainable society must know that unpopular measures must be taken from time to time.
But they managed the situation correctly and maintained beneficial results even though they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, at Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
“We have built a training and research center with the endowments, strengthened the company’s presentation in international trade fairs and won the main awards in national exhibitions,” says Zdarsky.
It all makes us think that the crisis is behind them.
The number of employees is also increasing, and the number of employees is increasing.
“To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere,” says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that eliminates pointless regulations.
The Absurdity of the Year investigation is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could have been deleted.
The little glorious winner of this year’s Absurdity Survey of the Year was the obligation to bring to the offices documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social affairs administration requested a paper extract from the trade register while the grievor can get it in two clicks of a mouse.
It changes with the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract of the trade register for the payment controls of insurance," Jana Buranova, a spokesman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ), said in a statement.
Highlighting all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must comply with in the Czech Republic and suppressing those that are absurd is the meaning of this year’s Absurdity Contest.
This investigation is again this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3,000 voters appeared, it is at least 4,000 this year that brought their votes.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only slow down the company, and, this, more and more.
“We may be the number of documents to fill in for tax returns at the top of the world,” says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the rest of the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is ranked 74th in terms of terms for the company, which is 8 places more than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was established for the first time in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic absurdities every year from April to the end of September, the latest deadline before the closing of the contest.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest selects seven candidates for "the prize" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that has received the most votes is declared a winner.
Until the last survey last year, it was a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by the entrepreneurs as well as the professional unions and professors.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, so among the nominees is, for example, the obligation that highway and highway maintenance vehicles pay the tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees re-sign two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always begins in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which people from political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the closing of the competition.
“Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts atons in the feet of entrepreneurs and for that my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the business,” said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd decrees is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days in advance to the office for the individual company at the place where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Individual Enterprise Act.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, which was to declare to the Labour Office a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee, was deleted with the text of the Green Card Act.
And everything is fine until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year—the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training or sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year’s Hospodarske Noviny contest, which has already been in existence for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the year 2010.
The objective of this competition is to support the reasonable and fair company.
“We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their business on the environment and conduct a socially responsible activity,” says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this sub-category of the company’s 2010 competition, organized by Vodaphone, companies that do not succeed with a single long-term objective for the company have registered.
The adventure of each of them is full of inspiration and an independent article would be to edit.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be regarded as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole of the Czech Republic is not example the Prague-based prologue company Et Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company that has been the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
In order to take care of employees with health problems, one can also mention the old Podebrad paper manufacturing plant, which employs more than 70 percent of them and, for this purpose, obtained the title of the company Responsible for the Central Bohemian Region and which was placed third in the region of the Concours.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, that has won for having introduced relaxed working hours and even decreased up to 35 hours per week on average and, this, without, proportionally, a decrease in wages.
The jury awarded him the title also because it prioritizes Czech manufacturers, supports a close-knit activity and cares about the environment.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment,” said Miluse Ryznarova, the company’s executive director.
IT responsible company Enlogit de l’Region de Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up for each laptop an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected plant for its actions.
“We also support the Man in the Shadow Foundation that helps the local Roma community,” says Ondrej Suchy, the company’s representative.
At the very last rank is, also for its activities, a company of Washing and Cleaning of the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
“In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increased qualifications and leisure,” says Joseph Strapac of the construction company Bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravian-Silesian region.
They were automatically registered in the Responsible category, all regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year contest, who had answered the questionnaire attached to the registration document and sent it back to the organizer before August 15.
The poorly completed or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the contest by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in question had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the contest of the firm Responsible but were not disqualified from the "principal" contest the Firm of the year of Vodaphone."
“Independent registrations are not possible because this is a subcategory of the Company’s main competition of the year,” explains Karel Goldman of Bison&Rose.
At the Lands Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public contest
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have carried out arrests in recent days.
The detectives passed the handcuffs to the local entrepreneur and real estate trader Lubos. G.
The Commission had endeavoured to properly handle a call for tenders for the settlement of a request for refund in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a particular candidate.
He had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for an initiatory offence as part of a call for tenders and a public competition," Plzen Prosecutor's Office chief Antonie Zelena told Pravo newspaper, knowing that it is forbidden to provide further explanations.
The police released the 46-year-old businessman after 24 hours.
To find out how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate with regard to so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, the spokesman for the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund said that the police had actually carried out an arrest in Plzen in a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a client and in no case an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and is set up when several candidates are eligible for the law.
"These people propose, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their restitution rights that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights, a buyer classification is established and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," the Fund's spokesperson said.
Lubos G., it is clear, had information about the people who had registered for the call and as he himself, too, had a person benefit because having purchased a large number of refunds, he had proposed to the field candidates not to participate in the contest.
And it was probably due to the fact that he was retiring.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interrogation.
Lubos G. had contacts largely above the standards at the FdT (Land Funds).
It was in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for publishing land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been issued.
Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place and place where the access artery to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it risked putting construction at risk by a land blockade.
Households will pay a surcharge of one hundred crowns per month for housing.
From January onwards, households will have to pay a surcharge not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
From January, families will have to pull up to a hundred crowns a month more than they do now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to increase by more than 100 crowns per year for apartment households than at present.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices given the sensitive development to encourage the manufacture of renewable energy, especially photovoltaic cells.
The gas increases moderately but of course at a time when people need it the most to heat up and therefore have the most consumption.
It is also possible to add a hundred crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
These are mainly the largest municipalities that are planning to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay almost 50 kroner per month for central heating from January, and families in Libérec will pay more than 1000 kroner per year.
For Prague residents, an increase of 9 per cent for water and sanitation is being prepared in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change, the rents will pay an additional 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be one of the lowest compared to the whole country.
In Northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are increasing by 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices will increase significantly in the 450,000 apartments for rent starting in January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new rent increase will be brought before the courts by the company.
Regulated rents paid by people in nearly 300,000 apartments could increase by 10 percent next year.
The Czech children roam the rum and fernet. The beer is no longer in fashion and acts all softly.
The fernet, rum, vodka and in an exceptional way also the best brand of whisky are stolen from the parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who are thirsty, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the hospital for relapse are no exception.
This is a result of the experience of doctors who experience cases similar to admissions from the children's departments of hospitals.
“Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk.”
'The trend is really strong alcohols,' said Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the children's department at Horovice Hospital in central Bohemia.
“When they manage to chip a bottle of papa in the cupboard, it’s sometimes whisky, but it’s fernet and vodka that prevails.”
“Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not feel it,” explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, a spokesman for Motol Hospital, also gives her reason.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
“Today, it’s fashion alcohol, especially in elementary schools.”
“In some cases, it was a sliver that they brought back from the house,” Jurinova added.
According to the head of the Pélikan department, seeing drunk children aged 13 to 14 at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Prior to working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he spent ten years in pediatrics where ambulances were bringing schoolchildren from the wide surroundings completely drunk.
“A young girl was hospitalized four times.
“She began her career at twelve years old when she was brought in with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in her blood plus a mixture with ecstasy,” the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
“What’s interesting is that it didn’t seem strange to the mother that her daughter was absent for 48 hours,” the director of the department said.
It is precisely the disinterest of the parents or their unusual tolerance to the fact that their rejections give themselves to the drink which is the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to the experts, however, we are not talking about dependence, in its strict sense, for children.
“Alcoholic vocabulary means a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result from it but are not found in children.”
"For those who use repeat acool, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family background," explained the head of Pélikan Department.
According to the spokesman Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drinking children who are after emergency care brought home by their parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit down and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pélikan there are three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of witches, Saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
“Either they drink in spite of bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holiday.”
"Of course I lived in the day of the witches an admission of 7 drunk children at once," said Pelikan.
The drunk child who spent the night in the hospital under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffers the next day from the "woodball".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
“They’re better at it because they have a great evening and then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them.”
“They’re just amazed at where they are,” adds Pelikan, knowing that from time to time it spoils patients’ good mood at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and intensive care bed hospitalization can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I applied this as a means of education by counting to these children how much their drinking cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to pay for a single evening," Pelikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their managements in regression, which should recover from the parents the care-related burdens, do not deal with the cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time.
Two L-159 of the five aircraft in total, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off Tuesday for Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
This is the first time such devices have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seat versions of the L-159T1 that were up to now in service in the Czech Army and were in flight condition.
The remaining devices are single-seat versions of the L-159.
These are currently parked at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Ministry of Defense's press department, the physical departure of Vodochody's aircraft is currently unknown.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft planned for exchange have been taken on long-stored aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Department of Defense."
"The L-159 T1 twin seats were exchanged in the state," Pejsek told Pravo.
He said the army will not be without a two-seater since the ministry signed an agreement in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 single-seaters into two two-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first device in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it is committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of certain countries of the Alliance.
“In the contract it is clearly stated that the one that takes the L-159s into account is EADS and that they will be used to train pilots from NATO member countries.”
"It is therefore the case of the one who is considering determining how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by Mirek Topomanek's government.
The Department of Defense did not launch a tender and contacted EADS directly.
the defence management argued while the exchange ensured a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army purchased 72 aircraft from Aéro Vodochody and only used 24 of them, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will probably have legal implications.
However, the European Commission filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected as part of a European tendering procedure and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the latter is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the yearbook is a sign of low cancer risk
Men who have the index longer than the annular are at a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of male hormone testosterone.
“Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men before 60 years of age,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, particularly by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in the UK more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of the right hand shorter than the annular.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, we found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the yearbook, however, the risk fell to 33 percent, for men before 60 years of age the decrease in risk reached 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers cited - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is precisely testosterone that helps in the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of this study but that it does not appear to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is this Thursday morning covered in snow.
On the roads and sidewalks, there is most of the time of the compact snow, the breakers have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and the 93rd kilometer in the direction of Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno in the direction of Prague undergoes the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Automobile club central (UAMK) told the news
In the 91st kilometre a truck was hit, in the 93rd two heavy weights hit, the accident injured.
Several cars were also found in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometre in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at 190 km or go through Brno and then enter at 182 km in Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometers formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Lines of cars are created for example in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also closed.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams are delayed, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis-major state is yet to meet.
The railways and the airport also face problems.
Czech Railways have already had to remove 7 quick links due to snow.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travelers should be in control of the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11am in the night until 5am.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rolling but redoubled by vigilance.
On the Vyskov road, three side roads are impracticable, on the Brno road there begins to be places of snowfalls and on the Blansko road chains are mandatory to pass certain communication channels in the places above.
The Vyskov region has been one of the most affected places.
So far the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them you may need to send snowmen and snowflakes.
We can't estimate for now when they'll be rolling.
On the Hodonin road, caution is strict in the White Carpathian region.
On roads that are, with regard to nature protection, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warning CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell the most in northern Bohemia, with, often, up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, it has fallen up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snow was gradually disappearing in the Czech Republic.
Americans have a new ‘smart weapon’
The U.S. military has sent to Afghanistan a new “smart” weapon, known only under the code name XM-25.
The generals think that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is like a super precise cannon
Its projectiles are laser-guided with an accuracy of a few meters.
The special ammunition of 25 mm caliber developed for this rifle and containing a highly shattering explosive, actually works like small grenades.
The ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode at the contact of the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy that hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is also not protected from above and when it falls on it a deadly rain of steel bursts, it can put it out of combat as well.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use “smart” technology.
"The soldier essentially uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtaining a precise point of view, according to which he corrects his target site and presses on relaxation.
"Let's say you aimed at 543 meters."
"When you press the relaxation, the weapon loads and fires at a distance of 543 meters, plus or minus 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 Delocalized Jobs
The Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer to Astro Park their workplace, which is currently in the office building at Place Mareinbader in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday by the giant specialized in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far on Marienbader Square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, an immense office complex located on the street.
A Fujitsu spokesperson explained that in the medium term, the group is expected to bring together 100 other jobs still scattered in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and Astro Park’s open-air offices are better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Bernd Wagner, CEO, said: “Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with a remarkable infrastructure.”
He says that connecting to the airport is just as important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region sparked the joy of the winners yesterday and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been won.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its location is an important boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management informed the municipality of this intention very early on.
“It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company,” Korwisi said.
However, friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer in the face of the owner of the Marienbader Place building.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding that such an exceptional place remains unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'H<0xC3><0xB4>tel de Ville, used until now by the Fujitsu company and the nearby "little vertical", as well as the rest of the buildings of Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the thermal resort.
As a result of a joint project of the municipality and a developer of private projects, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the City Hotel. This caused a lot of criticism, not only because of the impressive layout of the surfaces that used to serve as part of the parking lot, but also at home.
In 2001, the rating and investment advice company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt-based group Immobilien-Chancen purchased the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group, headquartered in Tokyo, is regarded as the world’s third-largest supplier of IT products.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
Its branch established in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electrotechnical Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Amazon Internet service provider has expelled from its servers the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may hide political pressures suffered after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of WikiLeaks, Mr. Assange, apparently resides in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with ever more force.
The group of cyber-activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the eminent U.S. Senator, Joe Lieberman, called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is likely to be staying in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excludes the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom", the cyber-activists said on Wednesday (local time) behind the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Earlier, the cyber-enterprise, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach as many documents as possible.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: “Formidable, our dollars are now spent to care for people in Europe.”
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
CNN, citing Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon has banned WikiLeaks from using its servers after the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman's associates.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, the British newspaper "The Guardian" reported.
"I wish Amazon would have taken this measure earlier in view of previous WikiLeaks publications of classified information," he said.
At the same time, Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
“Wikileaks is acting illegally, monstrously and unscrupulously, thus putting our national security at risk and endangering lives around the world,” the independent senators said in a statement.
“No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks spread the contents of stolen documents.”
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of people wanted by Interpol.
According to information released by the London-based newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described as intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the prosecutions committed against him by Sweden.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson told London that threats had been made against the site.
"Calls have even been launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is particularly afraid for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That’s why the founder of WikiLeaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was clearly responding to the statements made in North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican governor Mike Huckabee has demanded that the person responsible for Wikileaks’ revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Chief Advisor Stephen Harper said on television, ironically, that Mr. Assange should be "killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a drone."
Meanwhile, a controversy erupted between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for U.S. President Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed that she was willing to do business.
“I don’t know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website.”
The U.S. government now completely passes the test bench to protect its databases.
According to a White House statement, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism, has been appointed to fight the leaks.
Mr. Travers is tasked with putting in place the "necessary structural reforms" made indispensable after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it wants to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they are ever threatened by Wikileaks revelations.
“We have put everything in place to get in touch with them,” said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if it is necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, we prepare the ice confiscators for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course organized for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, i.e., in German the slightly demoted ice confistor, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of Italian art of making ice.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatula, disposes it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice, can not avoid the “Gelato-University” of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of sorbetier<0xC3><0xA8>res founded the university of ice cream in 2003 so that the ice creams from its machines meet everywhere the Italian ideals high.
The three-day initiation course organized for future glaciers has been very successful and has attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered and extend over several days. Practical sessions are also organized in the private ice cream shop.
In the midst of a crisis of quarantine, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk realizing their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia and through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of artistic education from California, is proud of the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business management consultant and after a few years she wants to pull something unique from this nerve-wracking profession.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housewife came because her children love Italian ice creams.
The ice master Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice.
It is decisive not only the right flavor, but also silky flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees through an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
He then opens a tap installed on the machine: he brings out a pasteurized white base cream, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately asked the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one give free course to the personal pleasure of the experiment?
Mr. Luciano warns against letting himself be misled by the spirit of time.
One who speaks only of ice cream "made from natural ingredients", perhaps despite this has used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example, of guar seed flour obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will not crack anything other than ice granules.
Some changes to the base mass are allowed.
This becomes more exciting with the aromas.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that one acquires in the fruit or confectionery range of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and paste.
"the suppliers will all try to rub you with dozens of flavored ingredients."
“However, you should just try.”
Or in fruit sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruits.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it, becomes a yellow cream and, when added to the cocoa powder, forms the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course have to switch to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice are also subjected to the same experiment.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: from the taste point of view, this is not absolutely better.
Ice cream with hazelnuts does not necessarily have the taste of walnuts, when it is composed largely of hazelnuts.
Kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
“Only a balanced mixture properly reflects the taste of an ice cream,” says Luciano.
Ice making is a calculation exercise: if you use fish puree with a lot of sugar, you need to reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is necessary for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the winegrowers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the calculations easier.
The production of ice no longer requires, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
It’s not just the basic mass automatic manufacturing machine that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the mixture of ice is simultaneously beaten available to make it dull and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automations, slight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo sneezes with fruit purée from head to toe and thus crushes his fellow students when the control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes him.
Luciano believes that such an incident “risks to occur in every class: it’s only a matter of time.”
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that is experiencing the cultivation of genetically modified plants has entrenched the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now formulated by the group of experts Testbiotech which is considered an independent institute for the evaluation of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we're well informed," Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, told Munich on Wednesday.
Some information indicates that the president of the Efsa group of experts for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi pressure group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has contributed decisively to the development of the EFSA test prescriptions for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The developed requirements correspond textually to the position taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the mark of industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities established in Parma, Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech has reported a conflict of interest.
A senior EFSA official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period. In doing so, she changed camp.
Not long ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union authority in charge of control and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicions of both the German Federal Agency for the Environment and the German Federal Agency for the Environment.
However, the Efsa does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including those in the industry, is being exploited as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of EFSA are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) based in the United States.
This organization is seen as a neutral forum for experts who belong, among other things, to the field of science, industry and politics in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the expense of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feed testing in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
“We want to know what, for example, the impacts of genetically modified corn cause in the field,” says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results to be obtained.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how can you find them?” mr. Then asks about a tone of accusation.
This is also the view of Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist has been doing research since 1994 in the field of genetics and is currently working at the Polytechnic School in Zurich.
In this region, as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are hardly any researchers who are not affiliated with societies.
In the opinion of the companies, critical studies would not be published.
Hilbeck says that “industry controls security research.”
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell got it, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
It was manipulative.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and had begun to demolish a large part of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of the Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost several billion.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations resulted in the cessation of construction work.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (coquillary limestone) of Crailsheim, a tender and coarse pavé badly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor based in Ostfieldern.
A few fragments have been found.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He says with enthusiasm: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and earthy."
He claimed that by cutting it to the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he's going to do with this piece.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
traces of Stuttgart's stones lead to an old French army ammunition depot in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man does the old stone trade.
He bought all the stones from the demolition that took place in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappear into the landfill," he said in his office in a hut, which used to be a guard post.
He says that he was insulted and threatened when in September the newspapers reported that he had purchased the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for full days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the stone parallelepipeds weighing an average of 80 kilograms, the value of which is between 6.50 and 14 euros.
Some keep it as a memory while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half of them are still buried in the forest, the rest have been sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, landscape gardeners, Particulars.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could get into the trunk and trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "M<0xC3><0xA4>uerle" or into limitations of grasslands.
“In fact, this stone is nothing special,” says Mr. Rongen.
"This political component would not have been in the summer."
He enters his car all the way, making the turn of his vast 20-hectare empire.
He did law studies that he abandoned, and later began to study biology before becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a career.
And a stone lover.
It stores 40,000 tons.
He hoards treasure all over Germany.
It claims to be the largest merchant of ancient stones.
He's freaking out.
Sandstones carved with art are laid on the snow.
"Once upon a time, they were part of the Marienbr<0xC3><0xBC>cke bridge in Dresden".
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
He shows a lot of finger: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Good travertine."
The parallelepiped used to be part of the podium of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the red granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasien, the tuf from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that once the stones were carved by hand and moved with simple shovels and carts pulled by cattle, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were put in place."
He did not become rich, even less rich.
But this quarry now employs 14 people, as well as stone cutters, a sculptor, a forger, a glass blower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
“We’re working hard, but it’s rewarding,” says the waste recycler.
Soon, he must go to Cologne.
There are also stones to be saved.
Struggle of talent to conquer high potentials
The counter has a lively affluence.
16 students are struggling to buy small breads with salmon, tomato sauce and white food.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the automotive manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of some sort of idea contest, they need to talk about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, get to know the Volkswagen company.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body-to-body in the competition to find better brains and engage, like Volkswagen, in multi-form cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most talented graduates in amphitheatres as much as possible before they arrive on the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify exceptional talents within the framework of practical projects and to trust them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig the automotive group amadoued the talents.
A young staff lady shares pens, candy and cards featuring the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs to young talent; she shows them the ways to access the group’s premises.
It is Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig who is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
“As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know students, look more closely at serious candidates and appreciate those who enter online as an employee.”
According to Mr Sele, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive that we're trying to attract students with.
“In the past, the focus was rather on the professional project,” Selle says.
The struggle for the conquest of the new graduates will become much more intense.
In properties in the sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting through a kyrie of candidates.
But they must boast of their reliability and, above all, court the highly skilled workforce.
These are mainly graduates from the engineering sectors who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German Association of VDI Engineers, more than 40,000 engineering jobs remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the VDI forecast, the gap in engineering positions will be further widened.
Roman Dykta goes hunting for talent on behalf of KPMG, audit firm, accounting expert and consulting firm.
It organizes costly events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year so that they can travel through the United States in this way.
Participants can also visit KPMG’s subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The participant shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Dykta, the means used to search for high potentials in universities are becoming increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race."
“For us, a simple cruise was too little.”
For the talent hunter that is Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
“Until now, we have remained in touch with all the people who took part last year in a similar action.”
“Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their requests to our company soon,” he says.
In addition to the direct on-campus sweetening, small and medium-sized enterprises take part in a completely classic way by participating in trade fairs where they engage in brain-hunting.
"We try to reach graduates by participating in the professional fairs."
“For example, at the solar technology fair,” said Sitha St<0xC3><0xBC>be, director of human resources at Solarworld, a photovoltaic panel manufacturer.
This company based in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. St<0xC3><0xBC>be is aware of the issue related to the survey.
Currently, 35 positions are placed on the company’s website.
“At the moment, it’s very difficult to fill vacancies.”
“It’s expensive and takes a lot of time,” he says.
Another way to establish contact is to pass through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to undertake professional internships or write his or her final project of study with us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are advertised at solar specialists.
That’s why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
“Often, a large group can’t do that,” said St<0xC3><0xBC>be, chief of staff.
It has long been the case that money no longer plays a major role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for promotion are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual table of honour for German employers.
To this end, it questions employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and context while looking at employee framework conditions.
Ms. St<0xC3><0xBC>be, head of staff, hoped that this investment would enhance the company's image among job seekers.
“I think the candidates are mostly relying on external evaluations as far as a potential employer is concerned,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, it means first of all taking internal measures.
“The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through their own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"Satisfied employees form the best messengers."
When you treat your employees well and identify with the company, they do their employer’s advertising to their friends and acquaintances on their own.
“It’s like playing in an orchestra,” Kriegler said.
Obama has stopped the new oil drilling.
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, the southeastern state of the United States, in the coming years.
The Washington government has issued a ban An equivalent ban and thus definitively cancelled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drillings are still banned for the time being.
Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform that is the cause of this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of this accident, which cost the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, said he was willing to authorize new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents of this solution thus want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who is responsible for the devastating black tide in golf is not, until now, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which faces multi-billion-dollar claims for compensation, is at the heart of the accusations.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is expected to present its findings in December.
In October, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar lifted the ice from the drill bit after the platform exploded.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter control measures and stricter security orders, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing in-depth reforms.
At the same time, Obama announced that they would remove the lucrative tax niches of gas and oil groups.
The actors in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the rate of feed in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
“The government’s goal is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector,” according to the result of a current survey conducted in the sector by the BDO audit firm, ahead of Wednesday’s drilling ban.
Indeed, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: “Nobody knows exactly what will change with the regulation.”
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing into the rivers is oily brown; it emits a smell similar to the one that exists in the gas station: Because of a leak, billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live on theft, corruption, and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has good intentions.
“Don’t get tired,” the environmental activist tells reporters to calm them down: “You still have enough oil sludge in front of the water lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man plunged into the muddy water up to his chest, as well as the greasy drag that surrounds him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the glow of water in the color of the rainbow.
It cannot be seen that the basement is filled with brown sheets of crude oil.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells us that, in the past, she was collecting shrimp by whole seas here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters have completely tari.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil smelted from an oil pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the small neighbouring town of Bodo must now climb for six hours to reach the waters of the sea: Ogoni country in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire extent of the damage jumps to the eyes as you walk through the mangrove swamps crossed by streams of water.
Instead of clear water, the motor boat pours a sparkling brown water, and whoever dips his hand in it removes any oil cover.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the ground like stalks of spruce. Isolated palm trees sadly leave their palms hanging.
We look for the clouds of birds in vain, as we usually encounter them in wet areas: As soon as the off-board engine stops, a ghostly silence ensues on this ancient paradise that resembles a station-service by the smell it emits.
“What’s happening here is war against the environment,” says Mr. Celestine Akpobari in a sad tone: “Our lives are characterized by a permanent health hazard.”
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a besieged battleground for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. this was carried out in his productions in 1993.
Today again, the return to Ogoni country is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 wells of drilling and 7000 kilometers of oil pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields in the country are oil-rich.
All the few hundred meters stand in the water of steel trenches like bizarre sculptures: The heads of drilling holes are very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are cut by corrosion to the mark.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time into a piece, as a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters have spilled over the ecosystem in 50 years: each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that which flowed into the sea during the accident of the super-oiler "Exxon Valdez" in a large-scale environment 21 years ago.
Who should be responsible for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, the sabotage and siphoning of the pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists for their part consider the explosions of drilling heads and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner accused the Shell group of applying substantially less stringent safety standards to Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the failure rate of conduct is "still much higher than alleles".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, resembles an abandoned workshop, full of Cambodians and installed outdoors: They are completely naked and covered with Cambodians up to the neck.
A sparkling fire under one of the many tunnels that are sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without a pattern on the site must be detected: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the tunnel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
At first, the gasoline enters a container by passing through pipes, then at the end of the conduction of the kerosene droplets fall and diesel is finally obtained.
That’s how Michael and his four employees produce four 300-litre diesel barrels a day: “This brings us 34,000 Naira,” about $22.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a lower price than the ridiculously low price of just 40 cents per litre of Diesel: Because they buy their raw materials for free.
This is offered by the "protectors" who drill the network of pipelines throughout the country of the Ogoni. According to experts, the country is thus losing at least 16 million liters of crude oil throughout the entire Niger Delta.
Only a small fraction of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: The organized crime networks, which also include members of high-ranking politicians and military, carry the lion’s share in tankers and brazenly on the global market.
Activist Akpobari believes that the debate on whether to attribute environmental disaster or, rather, subversive activities to the population or to the laxist mode of production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen's lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refineries."
But, in the meantime, Ogoni's relationship with Shell has deteriorated so much that it was no longer a question of the group's withdrawal. "perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will turn out to be better."
So, Michael gets nervous.
“It’s a long time for you to eat,” announced the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be the subject of an arrest, but at the very least they will offer them wine cans.
Even soldiers mainly from the north of the country intend to benefit like all Nigerians from the raw material.
“From any point of view, this piece of shit has brought our country down very low,” Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover building defects in A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major security issue.
By examining a device that made an emergency landing, the investigators discovered a possible build-up defect that could lead to "catastrophic reactor failure."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, Airbus passengers belonging to the Quantas company had been visibly more fortunate so far: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft presented a serious safety problem, and it put in serious jeopardy.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: it can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of the oil pipeline, according to a position taken on Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a “catastrophic failure of the reactors.”
The Rolls-Royce reactors are concerned and are equipped with 20 A380 series aircraft.
The Quantas airline, which had to land in an emergency on November 4 in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now launched legal proceedings against the British manufacturer of reactors.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, giving her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas’s director, Alan Joyce, said his company would claim damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the fire of the engine.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the inflammation of oil that causes the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that other safety tests will be conducted on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered important enough to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the airline Quantas had immobilized his entire fleet of A380s on the ground for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa has replaced, as a precaution, the reactor of an A380.
The two-storey plane is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall across the whole territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, the snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany swelter: By glacial temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per place.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, winter service personnel worked on a permanent basis, but they were unable to come to the end of the snow that was constantly accumulating.
In addition, violent raids have swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Marine Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects that tidal surges will take place on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with levels of water up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snowfall on highways and federal roads has led to serious problems in Saxony.
That’s why the bad weather alert station Meteomedia announced the level of violet alert has been announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it’s the highest level.
In places, there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and cool winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars were trapped there at night.
Even in the land of Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused an interruption in traffic and caused plugs.
In Thuringia, snowfalls hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions to rail traffic occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, trees falling on the railways, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg was interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt its trip.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train with blankets, food and beverages.
Winds of snow swept the roads.
The snowfall has resulted in numerous flight cancellations at Germany’s main airports.
According to a standard spokesperson and flight information, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
A Fraport spokesman said 40 flights had already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers trapped at the airport are no longer numerous, although only 400 beds are available to them.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers present on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was rushed to a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car blew up on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce a good news: The snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will swell in the event of slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to less than 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its Twin Towers.
The deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could bring up to 500 million euros.
The Deutsche Bank has just beautified the group’s headquarters: The twin towers located in the Business District have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers had to return to their former place of service.
Meanwhile, the financial group is clearly looking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
This spokesperson did not state the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we will check whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or sell them, and put them back on lease later."
This is how Germany’s largest financial institution has already relinquished its seat shortly after.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the Twin Towers for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from own funds holders and then rehabilitated them.
The transformations aimed at energy optimization have included, according to some indications, around 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector estimate the value of the towers, temporarily renamed "Green Towers", to approximately 500 million euros.
According to the spokesman, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people are crying for the miners who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for the buried minors who were declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
We had not yet been able to lift the bodies because the safe situation of the damaged well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the damaged well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team was able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that minors no longer had any chance of surviving.
Until now, the bodies could not be raised.
Today, parents and friends have organized a feast in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a blazing sun in Greymouth in the south of New Zealand’s island.
They watched two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
The photos and personal effects, among which the clothes and surfboards, also had their place.
The flags were hoisted in front of all the country’s public buildings.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the commemorative party that New Zealand had nurtured the hope that minors would rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pits, said he cannot resign from accepting his son's death until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative feast.
Minors of South African and British origin also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police Prefect Gary Knowles told reporters that when the mass of explosive gas is displaced, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is Splatter an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old genre through his film, "Walhalla Rising", epic of the fighter.
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye is made prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, just because our husssin is used by the husssssin
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the burgundy doesn’t say a word about his real name. Even the other characters let out, at the very least, at the expense of one or two sentences a few appalling cries of agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and celebrated in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the setting of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal for more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travelling.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy related to the drug dealer fierce and full of style, as a sort of Danish Quentin Tarantino, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to the cinema.
Most fans of art cinema should experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and to the intestines.
The lovers of action films die of boredom, when the stag embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and fog before the crew continues to sail.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributors in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not a dialogue in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream turned into a film.
The spectator cannot escape it.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a sad soundtrack, but especially with an insatiable hatred that springs from the heart of the characters.
Only a young blonde boy, who stands faithfully by the side of the fence, preserves some innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the rogue hero whose mobiles are never known, but who comes back from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally allies by becoming a warrior, is perhaps sent from the devil himself.
It represents rot, but perhaps also, nothing but for those who are, anyway, rotting.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which aims at excitement, enthusiasm and wonder.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious Terrassing Works
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, let alone submit to the agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007, around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest city located nearby is 30 kilometers: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in IAEA documents, as it is a question of the reactor Syria has built appears with the help of North Korea in a stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the lack of electricity.
According to a U.S. intelligence briefing, the CIA, dating back to the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby locality, el-Kibar, would be well suited to producing plutonium, which would allow the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video featuring blurred satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the power plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, even the inside of it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is hardly more information available than at the time, and even, over time, the mystery is becoming more and more thick.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was certainly certain that Syria had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but had little indication that it was developing “an active nuclear weapons program.”
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "presumably reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation to be " plausible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as in the IAEA.
Asked how he made sure he was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior UN diplomat gave only a laconic answer in the summer claiming that the IAEA had "enough documents to ask questions."
The Syrians certainly took down the rubble of the “unused military building” and proceeded to a methodical flattening of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former chief inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered traces of uranium produced by men in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images from commercial service providers from a Member State showing the moment directly following the attack, which appears to be more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that it has never carried out a secret nuclear program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after analyzing the particles by calling it improbable.
Since then, damas has refused to discuss this issue, as well as satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection at the site of al-Kibar and refuses access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps a steady silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in exercise at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
This is how the investigation into this case has been going on since June 2008 without a result and is "increasingly turning into a serious credibility problem for the Agency", as recognized by a senior Western diplomat in service at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other facilities that must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated which facility it is here, nor what their function or what they are suspected of.
According to information published by the newspaper "S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also under the names of nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be in a military base or directly next to it; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is actually spies that would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA in order to spy on military installations.
In fact, it’s information provided by US secret agents that caught the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped in order to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could “serve fuel production.”
There would be "no indication of sensitive activities", such as enrichment and processing of uranium; processes that are essential for the production of nuclear weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to the unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible hypotheses about the following fundamental questions: where uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed for the manufacture of the bomb would have been separated later.
It is not known whether the gravitations, which could hide high-value traces, were stored in all three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with land are gone, no one will have information about the gravel storage site.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had in 1998 examined the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometers from El-Kibar, across the Euphrates, to see if it could be suitable for storing radioactive waste.
In a recent analysis of satellite photos taken on behalf of the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley established a link between these images and the reactor in question.
Photos taken by satellite, however, show that Syria has undertaken grounding work in the three suspected sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began to demand access to these sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it did not help to rule out suspicions.
It said in the diplomatic circles that the IAEA had spent several months drawing up a plan for inspections to be carried out. This plan was intended to allow Syria to preserve any military secrets. Only time spent shows how much interest inspectors have in this case.
In the meantime, Damascus also put an end to this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the U.S. ambassador who for a few months has referred to what is known as the "special inspections", one of the most powerful means of
The Director of the IAEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has certainly already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, such as this diplomat who gives thought: "It would be useful, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in a Time of War
It’s been bad since Angelina Jolie made her summer debut as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don’t know anything more about this story, but that’s enough to cause trouble.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian brothel during the Yugoslav war.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested, and in response, some planned shooting sequences in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests still continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the Women Victims of War Organization sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet with the actress.
A few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie’s script says enough about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization has subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) that Angelina Jolie be removed as a goodwill ambassador.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, granted a shooting permit in Sarajevo after a few hesitations, but it is not known why it did not come after that permission.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a lot of effort that she has made herself aware of the Yugoslav conflict, and she argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the opportunity to all the parties involved.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: Lovers knew each other well before the start of the war. He meets again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is still a big difference with the version "a rape victim falls in love with his butler".
That Jolie’s film began well before the war, of course.
The pressure that is exerted on her, says Jolie, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can get him peace: by illegally putting this scenario on the Net, like many others before.
Let's go!
Tonight, everything is going well again with the Irish.
There is no trace of consternation.
That’s why the local team overly dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout with joy on the background of strong music, they tripping feet.
Cork's Baileyu-Pub in southern Ireland vibrates because players launch and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters into the opposing team's beer cups.
This bizarre show is called "bi<0xC3><0xA8>re-pong". The winner pocketed 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to attend the World Beer Pong Championship in January in Las Vegas.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really don’t go well together.
And yet, in spite of this, the 26-year-old is trying to have fun, to turn away from the troubling question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will lead job interviews in New Zealand.
“I feel a strange feeling, though,” he says.
“The home country is so far away and I have no job.”
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man smiling.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner’s three sisters tried their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, her brother Colin now holds a position as a computer consultant in London.
Young people are leaving: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even anticipate a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are made, it will be a stream of emigration comparable to that experienced by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish have enjoyed great ease, grief now takes its place.
The economic crisis, however, mainly affects the well-trained young Irish, who have so far only experienced moments of happiness.
Unemployment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everybody had a job, there's too much money.
But, in the meantime, three out of ten people under the age of thirty are unemployed.
The Irish Times published ample letters from readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes to the brink."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunities is gone and our country is gone for a generation.”
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students’ Union, sees a darker future point because the government is just throwing dust in the eye and offers no future prospects to young people.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they don’t have a strategy to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
She sees how her comrades cling to a practical internship not paid to another.
She says that her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to address this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "Working AbroadExpo" exhibition which offers full support on the theme "working abroad".
“But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the ranks of the professional hierarchy,” he says.
His website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For the past six months, Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O’Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing left to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house right out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects in Hannover or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional job, in order to complete repaying the loan contracted to build his home in his home country.
“The situation is already a little crazy,” he says, crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
“I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I practically don’t live anymore.”
He bursts out of an embarrassed laugh by crossing the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of major brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>380,000, funded 100 percent by the credit.
“It was moments of madness, no doubt the money was easy,” he says.
Is he afraid of seeing everything go down because of the credit?
O'Donovan thought for a moment, rose from the hot tea and declared, "I have no children to entertain and I am young; even though everything goes through, I can go back to zero."
The building engineer doesn't like the complaints he's heard a lot lately.
“No one has to suffer from hunger, yet our situation is not as dramatic as what we once lived here on the island,” he said.
“Working abroad for a while isn’t what can happen worse, maybe that’s what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
“He was back after seven years and in Ireland, life just continued.”
I like this idea from Cian Tanner.
Let go of the future and find out how life is going elsewhere.
In his palmares, He already has a few years of work in London, which is why life should not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is one more thing that worries her in recent days: the party to be organized on the occasion of her 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a goodbye party.
“Only, not a lot of emotions,” he says while drinking a long sip of beer.
“Good-bye, it seems alarming.”
“Let’s call it a good-bye night, all relaxed, bringing together a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games.”
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become more of a concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased substantially in several countries across the South American Pacific (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after suffering a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, lowering the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44 per cent of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase of 25 per cent in 2001 (Chart 3)
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but a sharp increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America eroded support for democracy.
While this was good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have suffered only a brief recession and benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only slightly increased in 2009 and fell again this year to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It was only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say they or one of their loved ones have been the victims of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, cited by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A Soiled Vote
No one expected to have a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the devastated and plunged country into fear.
We presented ballot boxes and a new ballot, ballots scattered in the ballot boxes, sacked polling stations and intimidations.
The polling stations will open late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced as a result of the January earthquake, were wandering around the neighborhood to find out where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, denounced the fraud and demanded the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, regards the event as "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that they did not "believe that these irregularities, no matter how serious, necessarily invalidated the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, an unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew their initial call for the vote to be declared null and void.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no perceptible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second round reaching the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake still living in tents, we feared the participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so due to disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 ID cards needed to vote were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, of course, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
In the weeks after suddenly becoming a widow, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, president of Argentina, benefited from a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate by 20 points to more than 50%; it is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez’s choice, apparently in mourning, according to whether or not she would abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, had a habit of developing budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has plunged into disarray following Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement in power joined Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
But after chaotic sessions (where one MP hit one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president with even greater room for manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and trade unions’ wage demands, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made it a priority for growth and poverty reduction, rather than for controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which carried out falsifications of official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been boosted by high global prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation erodes the momentum for growth as a result of a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF monitoring, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices, which is similar to a prelude to the clean-up of INDEC.
It is not clear whether Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez wants to stay in politics beyond the end of her mandate, now that her husband is no longer with her.
If she does, she needs to win the support of the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is very much advocated.
When the Argentinians returned from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have refloated.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, without noise, many of her husband’s policies.
A half hour for China
Taiwanese voters are oriented towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters turned up on November 27, 70% of eligible people, to elect mayors and municipal councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment by the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for sentiments relative to the continent, having established innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganisation of relations with China proper since 1949.
I passed the test, but just right.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mayors, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic-Progressist Party (DPP), which looked at Taiwan’s complete independence, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT by 45%.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s vote share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the key topics of Taiwanese elections, including capacious country trucks and mass gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal outfits.
An attempt to commit a murder has also been made.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Link, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passer-by.
Curiously, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, said Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by directing the suspicion on the DPP and turning the voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking to see how much the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates played along with the plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid stopping its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also abstained from mitigating the anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, demanded confirmation as to whether his policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide commercial facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back to the brink.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let’s start at the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, he went wrong: his former boss, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, like Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it can also engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for an expert panel to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided their talks could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's precipitous approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be exasperated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen’s intervention, the DPP will have trouble choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT must make an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's ratings were low; despite a dizzying economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and widening the gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT said its office as well as its local antennas will be remanufactured.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan’s support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Nominations at the Grammy Awards: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to know about it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer handpicked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the Grammy Awards surprises this year with a major nomination in the category of "Best New Artist".
Considering Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since her 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist must not release more than three albums before the recording; which "establishs that identity."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skillful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line at Spalding in relation to Norah Jones's outstanding achievement in 2003's Grammy Awards.
Elsewhere, Grammy Award winners have rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "Instrumental Album" category, a twist on a thrilling recording that was one of the key favorites last year.
Among these Iyers, veteran saxophonist James Moody's "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's "Positootly" will be in particular in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a New Orleans raucous voice favorite and frequent guest at HBO's "Treme", has been honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also leans heavily towards a certain fusion with Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lor's albums.
The Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, has won some well-deserved recognitions in the grand ensemble category; in competition with Billy Childs' rich chamber-jazz ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose live album "Pathways" was a staple of his octet.
Grammy Awards nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
At the top of the nominations are Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo P<0xC3><0xA4>rt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles-based composer's Madolin Concerto, Avner Dorman, is also in the running for a prize.
The classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering recordings of orchestra, opera, choral and solo.
A category for the classic producer of the year stars five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classical album are the Symphony No. 3 and 4 by Bruckner of the Royal Orchestra of the Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra; and "Syquirical" by the Orchestra;
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" by Kaija Saariaho of Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wader" by The Enchanted Wader
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition include P<0xC3><0xA4>rt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatame Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
P<0xC3><0xA4>rt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in an performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute work is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he soon wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin performer Avi Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using Middle East sounds and a large number of North African ranges and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez received a nomination in the orchestra’s performance category for leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky’s works.
Instrumental soloists who received a nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalist-solist nominees; these are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vicica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixes, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Racines: my life, my song"
The Temecula mosque project won the approval of the planning committee.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Criticism of the project came to the fore by claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled on Wednesday evening that the new religious center respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
“A lot of good people came to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention him,” Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley, said in a statement on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it, as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice prevails."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the center, at roughly equally distributed speaking time, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no more America,” one speaker wrote.
"It's another monkey planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
Planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced the violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of the order of 135 families co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32-hectare site on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe that tolerates arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organization has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
“That’s why it’s very special, even though it’s far from being a really ‘foreign’ way of life,” said Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in the online edition of the Science newspaper Thursday.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
But the researchers found that the bacterium, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“We’re wondering what’s still possible,” said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, Anbar says.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could reveal the discovery of an extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms might be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we think is absolutely necessary for life, might not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, Professor at the Milles-Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t Institute of Scientific Research.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
“This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
It was not a lucky discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it has speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances might be able to replace each other.
“Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus.”
"As a result, organizations have a hard time distinguishing these elements separately."
“But arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and, somehow, erases the work of our biochemical machine,” Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of the Earth's existence, she says; thus, the researchers hypothesized that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed in the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs were found in Compton
The other two dogs on four steals from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, Los Angeles County Sheriffs announced on Thursday.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were recovered late Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
“The good news is that dogs are doing well,” Whitmore says.
"They're in good shape."
"They have been returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
“We don’t want to say it,” Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
Owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in an animal shelter in Downey County.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were healthy and safe, the authorities announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were worn missing until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the national championship "AKC/Eukanuba" in Long Beach, where they were planning to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other tests scheduled in the days prior to the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple’s almost one-month dog show tour.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs – a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton Spaniard – who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left Akitas and corgis, thicker fur, in the truck where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so that the dogs could have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck's flight at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was granted on Thursday.
The lion is ready to redo again, MGM restructuring no longer waits for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start again at zero.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York on Thursday officially lauded the “pre-packaged” plan by creditors that about $5 billion of debt would be wiped out; paving the way for the entertainment company, having 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on film production and distribution.
With Thursday’s decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no longer any legal obstacles remain before MGM to get back under the watch of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the studio’s CEOs.
The staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has completed a $500 million credit facility, which is expected to fund MGM’s new operations and productions.
It is currently distributed under license by the investment bank, which itself faces $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio's restructuring process began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to place its finances given that it did not have the means to pay interest amounting to $300 million per year.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a rectification expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial difficulties and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the sum of 2 billion more of which the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be reworked as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of disagreements and internal discussions, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially goes out of business in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have raised $375,000 per month for their corporate management services, will receive a “success bonus” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to relaunch the production of MGM, which has only released one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros.
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to fund its share in these two films, which must be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM’s debt, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech Toys to Keep Your Budget Gifts in Balance
Although the main candidate for this year’s most wonderful toy is IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft’s video game system, Kinect, both can make a major break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 strings to jump classic beads, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget gifts in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - to see the electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
It is clear that Moore’s Law has evolved, this year’s technology toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are usually fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most well-known of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the button battery toys are on the rise, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are plush toys the size of an Indian pig that sing a note when you press them on the stomach.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second makes it possible to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start pushing, you can no longer stop.
To combine the song with the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel-locking.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It’s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a backpack filled with quizzes designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve scheduler.
If you’re suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three stand-alone alternatives.
The Mobigo from VTech ($60, for 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games don't educate as effectively as the Explore Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years old), it's the first major revision of the Leapster range, and more recent.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for 3 to 7 year olds) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and comes with an SD card input that lets you view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and up) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a lightbox, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based solely on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online Penguin Club pet, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6 to 12 years old) which includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items of their choice.
It can be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years or more) is the latest micro-robots with battery button.
The false bestiole moves quickly on 12 vibrant silicone pastes in random directions.
It’s fun to do a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.

Bringing a softer side to maintaining order in China
Tang Shenbin was touring a place in the city like an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nervous charges, by issuing low-level orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of the chengguan—impossible leaders of public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and their penchant for violence—to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"Hold on right!"
"Be insightful!"
“Show them,” he said, “what beautiful girls look like!”
Four girls who had barely spent their teenage years in white gloves, dressed in identical jackets and pants of olive color, were staring at you.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned to the rule.
Four perfectly groomed hats perched on top of hair attached by a blue and white striped knot.
“Personally, I think they have an average appearance,” Mr. Tang said, with disdain.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China’s urban inspectors.
A city has demanded that all new recruits have a higher education degree.
The province of Guangdong traded the gray-green uniforms for a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, has replaced eye-dropping in the strong way:: In 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the striker packed his cases and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in the urban environment of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, their yellow and their young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties to look at this China's underground urban brigade
And because of that, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these agents are only allowed to enforce municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media portrays the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei Province beat an observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them as they dispersed a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and put online, described how to effectively beat criminals without emitting blood.
This year in Shanghai, a caterpillar was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available via online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained in assault from street vendors.
"Chengguan has marked the government," China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after a heated debate over tactics.
The newspaper called for a "true complete clean-up."
The skeptics say the approach is far from it.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered if women had real jobs or if they were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's announcement required female candidates, aged 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five features of the face in the right order."
They must be larger than the average size, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at 26 years is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too painful for women over 25 years of age.
“It’s their image that’s important,” a certain district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable; it is the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "inner qualities."
Chengguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city district management office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that the height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement relating to the order of the features of the face.
That it means beautiful is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, people with disabilities or disabilities should not apply.
“We can’t let a boxer or a boss come here to serve,” Zheng said.
“It wouldn’t give a good image.”
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheeks stuffed with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the enhancement of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with a faint air.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old fossil colleague, said: “Our job is to present the image of the city.”
They do not object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they feed on greater career ambitions than simply throwing sellers into the streets where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen walking merchants who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as much as possible small breads or tofu bowls before taking the run.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you so many times!" said Ms. Xu as a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning her noodles bike.
Agents describe their functions as monotonous rather than hardy.
“It’s pretty much the same thing every day,” said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods from sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after the spread of false rumors that Chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen policemen and Chengguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
So far, Xindu has escaped such violence.
But calm is not guaranteed.
Just two blocks from Baoguang Square, where female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered on the corner of the street.
The officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as the regulations imposed on them.
The owner of the bike was screaming at the scandal.
An iron arm of 15 minutes followed before the police, in the sinister face, shoved a road by elbow to their vehicle and left at full speed with the bike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men’s team, stayed behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators – men aged 40 years and over – play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in order to keep an image chirped.
"Sometimes, we fight verbally."
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Li said in a neutral tone.
“Most of the time, it’s the audience that starts.”
Prosecutors will not blame Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Department of Justice have raised criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, stemming from a case involving a former campaign assistant and his efforts to obtain lobbying work for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican from Nevada who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal surrounding his case made the major national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said he was "very happy" with the decision, the result of a one-year investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Justice Department had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he had no intention of holding any charge against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice has refrained from commenting on the matter.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, according to which there is significant evidence that Mr. Ensign had conspired to violate a federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative lobbying job to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife about it.
Mrs. Hampton once served as a cashier during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with the documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been an employee of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for one year by law from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to be in contradiction with the so-called ban on the revolving door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there seems to be prima facie evidence of a plot to violate and substantially violate the law of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of a government investigation.
Although the department judge declined to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of high-level setbacks for his last year's arrest, including those who had been convicted of the crime.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the Citizens’ Director General for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s chief attorney, said in an interview Monday that he had received a phone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice and a follow-up the next day, telling him that the department was not seeking charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed on Wednesday in a statement, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins declined to clarify the legal arguments he had made at the prosecutor's office.
“I’m not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Justice Department, except to say that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that Mr. Ensign's parents' $96,000 payment was in violation of federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him he was "marting" the Interior Ministry on a matter in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and he asked the Secretary of Transportation to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Mr. Hampton in lobbying.
When the news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as the fourth Republican in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and put an end to his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were typing away in the rows of the audience room.
They sent every minute of the horrendous testimony reports via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape trial and the children tied to their bed in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to result in an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court that outlines appeals, which could occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reports on the trial — as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists — created a “circa atmosphere,” a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury was badly influenced by the public’s passions.
The request could lead the judges to debate whether the new technologies require new rules in the courtrooms.
“I’ve experienced this in the trial; I think there’s a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms brings human rights to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, counsel for Hayes, chief counsel.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the Superior Court of State, laconically rejected the claims in the ruling made last week, claiming that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
The appeals courts have recognized for decades that the media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 ruling that dated, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his decision that there was a "carnaval atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have stated that the appeals courts filed to review Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the means of communication of the hearing rooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
“There’s a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media” in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue claims that some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from the courtrooms could allow for more fair trials.
The Twitter case is just one of many others described by Mr. Hayes’s lawyers, likely to be discussed for years; which delays execution.
The defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered harm when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley, and 11-year-old Michaela.
The defense lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of the prosecutors, and that he abused the pressure for a verdict by making an unusual decision to sue the judge.
The jury was not sequestered.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media did not cease to ignite the flames of the emotion of the case.
“The daily buzz of media, cameras and journalists’ tweets in front of the courthouse,” the lawyers wrote, “didn’t resemble anything that had been seen here before, in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally.”
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists said that the claim that the news was more incendiary than the statements given more slowly was a ludicrous view that would impoverish the Court’s policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said that the appeals courts were often attracted by arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard’s conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and they specified that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civilization bring the splits closer together?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is it a sign of genuine bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the quick return to partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not produce any breakthroughs on the major issues that need to be addressed during the “boxy duck” session.
But obviously, there has been at least one polished discussion about the differences between the two parties as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to score points.
The committee’s public meeting on the president’s deficit was equally civilised, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months created a mutual respect transcending the ideological divide; but which, however, still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two sides are now in a trial and trial period with a view to obtaining signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
That’s why Tuesday’s meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxation, spending, health care or rights, both parties remain miles away.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
“There’s no doubt that things have changed on the pitch,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now alongside the Center for Ethical and Public Policy.
“It’s inevitable after the election.
The elections generate partisan passions, and then they cease to exist.
That's good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda for the "boxy duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of it, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is conceivable on the extension of unemployment benefits, only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to the unemployed.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "boxy duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that a fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable.
“Once the things that need to be done are done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations,” he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civilization would lead to true cooperation.
"I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow boxing compared to the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present in the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These partisan positions are already clear in the early reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, delaying the retirement age and reducing spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, according to themselves, imposed the question of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they needed 14 votes in the committee, made up of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they had trouble reaching that number.
The greatest resistance persists among the group's elected representatives, suggesting that there are, at least today, few grounds or will to compromise on tax matters.
Galston plans two phases in the fighting between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
The public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as in 1995, then the two parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
Those who will be judged in loss will have to change their minds and find compromises.
But that would still be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans in Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a simple prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization exhibited this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a consensus on the issues that still divide them.
U.S. documents released describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city’s control is in the hands of a “Kleptokratia” and passes to the Kremlin part of the wine cans and the protection money it collects, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate companies but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the “vertical of power” – takes its share as money moves up the scale.
The service note, which was sent to Washington on behalf of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been purged.
It was written while Yuri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there have been few traces of cleaning since then.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Baturina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied allegations of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation trials over these allegations.
In September, he said the following to a Russian television channel, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's throwing, it's anything."
The Russians believe, with an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information in an embassy report; and it is in vain to conceive that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link established between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it "disfunctional" and to claim that the government was functioning more like a kleptocracy than a government," the embassy said in a statement.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘krisha’ (a term used in the criminal world/the mafia that literally means ‘roof’ or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor’s office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the government.
"Analysts to identify a three-tiered structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, MVD and militias are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a void in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB is raising money from the largest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understood that it was better to get protection from the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups are pros as well.
“That’s why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer that high.”
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself may be unequal; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has mentioned the fight against corruption several times but has admitted little progress.
The embassy's note conveys accounts of men who bring suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev relies on bureaucrats,” said in a recent interview with the Moscow think tank Indem.
"But he's part of that bureaucracy."
“It is not part of a political class because it does not exist in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the cost of corruption, across Russia, would amount to more than $300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the note from the U.S. Embassy, which was only made yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly resonate with dissatisfaction within the Russian government; although Loujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for the failures of Moscow, this could be the occasion for the Kremlin.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted angrily to the statements that U.S. diplomats had made by calling him Batman and bringing him closer to Robin.
"The problem lies in the fact that it is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
“But to be honest with you, we didn’t suspect that it would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics.”
Former Khmer Rouge Fighters Forced to Face the Past
In a poorly lit classroom with decretized concrete walls of poor quality, the director of Anlong Veng High School talked about the man who had built it, the last head of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of old soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally challenged by Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led by the United Nations, delivered its first sentence regarding a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, 35 years in prison, the former head of Tuol Sleng's notorious torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "the Red Khmer."
Faced with this evolving situation, anxiety has increased among the former Khmer Rouge fighters of Anlong Veng; complicating the efforts of reconciliation and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There are resentments and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
“For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
"The situation generates divisions within families."
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were directing the guerrilla from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating with the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and of Nuon Chea and Khieup.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held the lead, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters have plunged into black misery, common to the rural regions of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although some Khmer Rouge elite officers have retained their positions as local leaders in exchange for having deposited their weapons, they are unqualified low-grade and low-profile farmers.
“These people have benefited from very little follow-up after capitulation,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbued with the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
“They were raised in an environment where doing business is a foreign concept.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to support our own needs.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court has also raised concerns here.
The court is expected to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court’s mandate is to judge the senior leaders and the chief perpetrators of the crimes, but he did not say whether he was continuing beyond those four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears of Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation turned to 64-year-old Im Chaem, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey Province under the rule of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers were allegedly killed.
Recently, on a stormy evening, Im Chaem returned from fieldwork near his wooden house on pilots, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court called her, she said, she would refuse to go.
“Cambodia is at peace and stable,” she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecutes several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Youk Chhang of the Documentation Center.
“The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces,” he says.
“We need to put these pieces together so we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history textbooks, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, Anlong Veng’s youth know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new manual helped students understand a significant part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he came home with the book to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he says.
“They’re suspicious because they don’t know exactly how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
However, the Khmer Rouge retains a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a road, invaded by weeds and paved with plastic bags, leads up to a rectangle of black suede, covered with a rusted sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile phone salesman on the roadside, said she didn’t know much about the man who was incinerated at that place.
“But he has a great spirit; and many people are going there to pray,” she said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday and, later that day, she planned to walk to Pol Pot’s last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its military-grade uranium stockpile
The Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it will abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide.
The agreement was released in a joint statement released after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations were carried out with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a research center in Belarus.
This paved the way for an agreement Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the matter by about <0xC2><0xA3>500, according to an official who spoke about the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to provide an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
“I’m really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“It proves to me that this process works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security advocacy group.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" carried out by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept high-enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and low-enriched uranium," Loukachenko said at the time.
“It’s our product ... We’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus came close to the United States a few months ago; however, expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated as the material had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by air, according to officials.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus's research facilities with poorly enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
“Detailed coordination and organization have been put in place to build trust,” leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the energy department specializing in the Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates from the James Martin Center for the Study of Nonproliferation, Belarus this year had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilos of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Loukachenko’s harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential to improving bilateral relations; and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens," he said.
The government has not issued any objection to CIA flights
The government has issued no objection to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners heading for Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the leaked documents (cables) by WikiLeaks in the daily El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, which add that the first vice-president of the Government of that time, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "show that they can prove that they are
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing of complicity in human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting was held between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "surprised Zapatero's government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega has stressed that Spain has no objection in relation to intelligence flights over the Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken away", Aguirre reports in a cable.
Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of that time, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give the lowest possible profile to this case, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
In turn, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez conveyed to the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the CIA's Department of Defense on Flight.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the United States expressed concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" more than for CNI o's declassified information from the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maneuver the case discreetly between Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 during a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even though the Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they think is appropriate", he had given the instructions to his co-workers as "instructors".
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the PP's action in this case.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations," the United States said in a statement.
The parricide that went to confessions complained in the network of the "accidentally" to be a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is "Muki" in the network.
With this surname she used as a child, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; the two natives of Noia, the village of La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a from which she came.
Messages are from 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his emotional life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with industrialist Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they broke up, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elector was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
With him, she co-existed for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to explore the labor market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But according to the content of his communications, it is heard that their idyll broke, they separated.
In March 2008, she is in Minorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and disgusted by the fact that I came to work there."
“When I told him, it seemed like a good thing to him, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day long and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
And then she talks about a mobile message she just received: “I want you to come home this month or give me an address to send you the child.”
She complains, "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home," she complains.
In May, she spoke of her return to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'll only stay until 19, because on the 20th I have to show up at a job so I don't lose it."
She explains that if everything went well, she would have taken her elder with her.
“He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him in my life with another person if that person is not my mother,” he said.
In July, there is another post.
When she tapes it, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly murdered on the 10th, has died.
“César is happy on one side, but he is not happy on the other.”
“On one side he’s with me and he likes this place a little bit, but on the other he goes to school almost every day.”
She's talking about a trip to Majorca.
“I’m going to be there a few hours in the summer and that’s how I save some money from the baby-sitter.”
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos in the email, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money".
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Terreur <0xC3><0xA0> la galicienne (epigraphe)".
The last man who lived with her, vigilant, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn’t want to think that everything had happened so that she didn’t tell him that she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica entered the provincial penitentiary of Palma yesterday, from the Menorca judicial detention centre.
The attorney-at-law, Carlos Maceda, explained that she did not remember how the facts had happened, "and she did not intend to harm the minor either."
She had previously confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and deposited her body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor have requested a psychiatric trial.
People's Party members would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9 seats.
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and deputies registered in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the general elections because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation gets in these elections is usually double the one that it receives in Catalonia.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 general election, while in the 2006 autonomous elections they obtained 316,222 votes.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, which is desired to divert the votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, the analysts of this formation have calculated that, if there were general elections, the PPC could have gone from 10 to 12 MPs in the Congress (as long as there were no members of the PSC in the Congress, and as long as there were no members of the PSC in the Congress).
These calculations would find that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the populars, ERC would lose one MP - it has three now - while ICV would keep one MP or win one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal councils, where the people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay to the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the top 6 administrations that manipulates it.
Both nationalists and populars agree that PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get the majority either the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fantasize that this formation loses its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
People have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven inmates in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians detained by agents of the General Information Commissioner of the Barcelona Police (2008 General Information Commissioner) formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including "Les Tigres pour la Libération de la Terre" (Les Tigres és) de l'Tamil" (Les Tigres és) (Les Tigres "Les" et la Liberation de la Terre de l'Tamil)) (Les) (Les)
The Ministry of the Interior attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" "was debilitating" Al Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus at the international level and "therefore, its operational capacity".
Investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrated the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its "combatants" could cross the entire borders of a European and other countries.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why investigations have involved, apart from Thai services, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be similar strikes in the following days to that which has been recorded in the nude.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were detained in Thailand, and another was held in Thailand, with the capture of the Pakistanis, and the Pakistanis, and the Atyamans, the Pakistanis, Eh.
They were the ones who led from Bangkok the cell located in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network – some of which were hit in 2009 – was mainly stealing from tourists passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called “World Islamic Front”.
That is, the documents were to be on behalf of young men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
Investigators point out that so far no details have been found connecting detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, even though the author of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it must be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, Catalonia was sent through a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that were “invested” to buy mobile cards that were used after by the “commando” that killed 106 people.
The police have taken over a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of the PPC, Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally tell Artur Mas his conditions to support his investment as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which is to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of the necessary economic resources.
The president of the popular Catalans arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the certainty that the fact that he obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to make himself loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise will abstain in the elections.
A possible deal with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general election, but for the time being, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are held in Catalan key.
And as for the president of the PP, to support an investment “all sovereignist and independent discourses should be eliminated”, and the economic complicity – similar to that of the Basque Country – that the convergent leader wants to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to undermine the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to estates and donations.
Details of the negotiation on Mas’s investment will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the centre of Olot do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
La Caritat d'Olot (Girona) gave a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people, of whom he was responsible during the interval he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the lawyer of the center, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to pursue the charge against the responsible" for the dead but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for failing to detect in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a major compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day on he did not cease to kill.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - which he suspected in many cases no doctor personally explored the deaths but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
La Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures cannot at any time have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there is only one indication of imprudence on the part of any other person other than the accused."
The person already named "The Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused his death by injecting him with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control the access of the staff of the center to the medicine.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to relieve internal suffering, used to kill them.
But lab analyses will clarify if Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already admitted he did with the three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the nurse at night, nor the number of confirmed murders, they do not rule out the possibility that the number is greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in his changing the way you are now.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
The ECB's threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet’s threat, warning that “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
The differentials of the peripherals have closed to force and the shares of European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the ability of the ECB to deceive itself and the euro has barely recorded an increment, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that, in the same way it collapses, it recovers, but is motivated by short and highly speculative position fences.
The institutional investor will soon lose the fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the long term and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and will continue to sell at unlimited quarterly auctions at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity until at least June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and that we will even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blindly to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they claimed they hadn’t even considered buying bonds and they collapsed markets, the story could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year trade auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have dropped 30 basis points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potentials and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are admissible in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have enough support, so Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release the tension ahead of the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest is the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the president had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange suffered 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been fast and radical and we are enjoying the surprising effect.
Today there is a key three-year bond auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will resolve with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to request an Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we don’t need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in available liquidity, tripled from March, to very expensive types and they cut access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar’s wife, “apart from being, appearing to him.”
Courage, we can get out of it!
The president of Eulen will challenge the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will contest, as he considers it "lawless", the El Enebro Judicial Council on the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the holding firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José assign their legal battery to the new chapter of their dispute for control on the part of the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding company does not appear to be willing to surrender in his dispute to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From his board he was excluded by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors in the shareholders' meeting of January 18 this year whose dispute is recorded in the Register of Trade and Companies.
The El Enebro Judicial Council for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate No. 2 of Madrid, reopened the box of thunderstorms within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The use of the judge to determine the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate recourse of the claimants his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly defrauding the law and abusing the law", to validate and correct it.
This argument will be the basis for once the assembly has taken place to be challenged in view of the fact that it is "nothing of full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a holding company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, seeks the benefit of 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the application for appeal for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari triumph.
Without lowering the skill of the champion driver, the German Sebastien Vette, nor the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to turn him into a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very distant objectives of high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computing instrument has been used to create assembly chains from manufacturing plants around the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains the fact that the use of this computing instrument in its Formula 1 plant allowed Red Bull to create and execute “in a few hours, almost in real time” the changes, changes and improvements detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four vehicle improvements each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications on the drives.
The head of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of the Red Bull cars except the engine, which is Renault’s sole responsibility.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can go from virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological advancement there is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has established the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered a top secret.
The staff for this duty has 580 people, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull's Formula 1 is probably the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is priceless and the notoriety zero.
The plant’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in racing cars brought 50% of victories and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of success, while drivers bring 15% of value added.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science, because “they are unpredictable gladiators.”
HP will install 20 own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the 20-square-metre network that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will count on this initiative with the 16 zones already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the refurbished store located on the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which it has been working for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to deploy 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first opened were those in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the one in Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Director of HM Personal Systems has ensured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of exclusive store furniture (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the facilities staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive business network claims to “improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, assisting, after-sales and even packaging.”
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-class pioneering pilot program that solves the potential problems of HP’s computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
“So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days.”
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'flying' one million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse in interest margins, which will try to compensate in part with increases in commissions and in the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years, its task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to operate over the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 that will maintain a three-year viability.
The goal, apart from surviving without having to resort to FROB’s public subsidies, is to gain a market share by capturing a million new private customers – 700,000 if we deduct those who can leave the bank – its great task to accomplish, because until now this bank had spoiled more SMEs.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or what is the same, of austerity, with the reduction of costs as a goal, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans in the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year’s Optima management plan, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for an additional year.
Customers who leave the savings boxes to escape will be their main objective.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a “difficult and transcendental year”.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even though he thinks the liability war – which penalizes margins – is falling, the price of the risk premiums that banks and cashiers pay for their issuances to get cash is already moving at the price of the credit to offset the fall in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
“We didn’t tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already ordered its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoD<0xC3><0xAD>as of November 22 and 27.
He also admitted that the banking sector trend now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s management plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "larger dimensions will be called for."
"Everything will move next year," he assured.
He says capital needs are “increased enormously” and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that FROB can replace the market in fundraising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He notes that we cannot issue, but contrary to what happened in June, we can get short-term funding through rest, which is alleviating the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the caisses
The Director-General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of savings fund mergers and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is carried out.
When the process of concentration of Spanish savings funds began, there were several entities that ensured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, José Antonio Olavarrieta, general manager of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Funds (CECA), rejected yesterday the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been made, we can't say that the inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most of it has been fully realized; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation as well," he said.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the process of concentration is being carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is now being carried out in the time that we have not set it in.
“The passage of 45 caisses with an average of 28,500 million assets volume to 17 with 75,500 million is an unequalled process in history, reducing the number of entities by 62 percent so that they are much larger to be compliant in Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of rather unhappy opinions on the slow process" that demonstrate "a lack of serenity and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remind that the deadline must be respected before the end of the year".
The CEO of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and “probably” the world, and he attributed a “lack of knowledge” to people who doubt it.
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has started a process of concentration "very important" and "going at the fastest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector was well taken from the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin opted to remain in the euro, but it set the conditions for the whole of the Union.
Tensions in the markets have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero has announced new adjustment methods, ranging from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or the abolition of the 426 euros of aid to the unemployed without a professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of the AENA and the management of the Bara de las Praetos.
On the other, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, joins the critics of Chancellor Angela Merkel in terms of her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which is clashing with that of maintaining the ancient traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, Mark's recovery, although now it seems from science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines for countries that violate them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for a long time, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission boosted deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (tax rigor and public finance stability plans) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow to the Central European country was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From that moment on it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published one were against Greece’s bailout.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties to enable a country's bailout and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although a little sweetened, has been approved and, in the following months, we should be attending the process of reform of the Union which will make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we cannot agree too much, from that date on the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves in default and, in that case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany informs us that we must follow a strict path of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be bad not to hear it.
It is not just about resuming the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we are asked is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do under these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us greater peace of mind.
And let us know how to seize the opportunity we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with big companies and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticisms, we have opened the way to the thesis that we need to put on the order.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that are envisaged, one cannot exclude the possibility of abandoning a monetary area too crowded with unserious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us.
Sport and Fraud of the Law
The Russians similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the will to escape a sanction.
The expulsion ordered in principle by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has left a lot of ink on the anti-sport character of such behavior and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team was already clearly winning), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of their group, the two players will carry out the regulatory sanction during the next match of the barrier match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards to the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two matches and different economic sums to the players involved.
Provoking a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate that emerged in the reported case is due to the fact that this has had as protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem displays the nobility and honor and which on past occasions has condemned a fine to its players for similar acts) and to the dramatization of its more-orchestrated, more-orchestrated, more-dramatrated, more-dramatrated,
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is not expressly prohibited by the regulation that contravenes the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions commit a fraud in law; for, indeed, they are actions that are consistent with the regulation of sport, but seem to elude its meaning.
The issue is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sports spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put in danger, that is, there has been no violent game.
Another one of these assets that is alluded to with the correct game is to prevent the team from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not suit what is normally characterized as fraud or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in hiding to try to avoid punishment, but their action was more likely to prevent it from being used as a deterrent.
They waited and they gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders get from the intentional mistakes under consideration.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a disadvantage situation to the rival and one does not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action implies leaving their own team with fewer players.
And that’s not a useful strategy for the next match either, because the club couldn’t count on these players.
Obviously, the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without any cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated all of a sudden and apart from that, with this action the players perform a penalty match and move on to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of the cards occurs with one less than the first cycle.
So, climbing the stairs, it's not so clear that this is an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which is nevertheless part of the making of strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (it would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), but otherwise they chose rather the moment in which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without deviating from the penalty or fleeing it.
Even if the boundary between engineering and the fraud of the law is diffused, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of engineering.
The controversy, it seems to me, appears because of two factors: because there were two self-exclusions and because of the way in which the director was transmitted to cause them.
The evil caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive bids to pick up Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
This year, the dictatorship of the calendar focuses on an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the bull and the lottery, when December arrives there are also the dinners of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have resulted in an offensive your prices adjusted to be able to catch the customers in the 20th century.
To finish complicating accounting, this year’s calendar (as the night of St. Sylvestre falls Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (17th and 17th) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying from their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they are all asking for battle prices, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauraci<0xC3><0xB3> de Barcelona, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The employer's representative, now, does not dare to predict what the holidays will be like this month.
“People think a lot before booking.”
“They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prices,” he said.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at a good price and with good service," he added, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so the slice around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey in various facilities in the center, there was a collapse of applications for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras group says there is an authentic demand boom for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar assumed more advance bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locations, remains optimistic after detecting a rise in billing since the second half and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group say the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies inviting their employees again and the feeling that the volume of the groups has increased a bit.
On the part of patron Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association), its vice president, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, trusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall reservations are "animated", even if customers "negotiate as much as possible".
That is true, the hope as far as the holidays are concerned has not declined, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises major concerns in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at “a faster pace than any other country.”
Wikileaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered through the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details offered on the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "downs" and that the more stable Asian country produces "unequal" than any other country in the world.
The peculiarity of Pakistan’s nuclear program – the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack – is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
This is how the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of the former National Security Advisor, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations in the territory under attack from the Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear materials including short-circuiting and the vulnerability to nuclear transport".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is being considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferator and a reason to maintain the guard.
“Pakistan has to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in its nuclear or missile programs,” said Yuryu, a senior official in the U.S. Department of Defense.
The new documentation leaked through the Julian Assange portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan’s high degree of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy dispatch in May, which calls communication with Pakistan “frustrating,” said: “Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or are eliminated.”
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during an army chief's visit, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the head that "Pakistan's army must end with tacit support for terrorist groups".
In the hunt for the Wikileaks leader
Obama will count on a high level of responsibility for the fight against terrorism to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a labyrinth complex where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, this is not new, otherwise it dates from November 20.
And this has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks creative lawyer Mark Stephens said that “the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
The 20-year-old international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol received the indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot give the order of arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red call a free way for the arrest - which the national police body must realize - that, especially if they have a bilateral agreement
The move angered Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder was willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via video-conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for and obtained a permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
“It seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the statement said.
As the world searches for him – and in Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he doesn’t keep quiet.
On Monday, he gave an indeterminate interview to Time magazine director via Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to U.S. diplomats that they spit at the U.N. by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request “ridiculous and absurd.”
"I'm not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us," he told CNN.
Obama himself has charged a senior counter-terrorism official, Russell Travers, with preventing further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to reduce Assange’s importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House starting in January, asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations “to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance.”
Further on, Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, returned to his statements after saying that Assange would have to be "killed".
“Obama should turn it into a target and use a drone or something like that.”
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
"He who is in the government that leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution would be a punishable offense," he told Fox.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seeks peace in ERC with eyeballs on Carod's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found the recipe to solve the last internal revolt inside ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 MPs and half the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it cannot give him any headaches as he did with others.
That’s why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with blinks that allow him to blinde himself until municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisors from ERC will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the Carodists want to convey a certain penalty vote to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself to be ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a "Bulgarian" result would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand the president a little more than making his position available to the militia, a move that is not worth it when Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a road map until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the National Council's vote on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s in exchange for his promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which leaders consider a safe event.
The leader of ERC admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that its goal is to make once and for all the organization is able to wash its laundry room in the family.
In this line, the article that current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s’ ideologist, the head of Innovation thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified “in exchange for various objectives” is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, of which he points out two.
The first, to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militia, that is, to include new figures coming from the adept sector of Carod.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows congresses to be carried out through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s team, who already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsive mandated the management to revise the assembly model in a specific convention for the reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors on the horizon, the time might be right to take it back and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the state of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to MILENIO of the state of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
During the previous month of the year, there were 390 deaths in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases is that of a body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots of firearm and the punch to the head, apart from the feet and hands attached with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatl<0xC3><0xA1>n, Naucalpan municipality.
Very early on Thursday morning, four jointly operated land owners found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal fires in the thorax, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Near the body was found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day after in Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots when he left his house to initiate the garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a head-to-head fire impact in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, Ecatepec municipality.
In Chalco, with the fire of grace in the front, we found the body of a man on a lonely path of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body we found a bullet struck with a 25-caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies performed a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
The residents of Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n alerted about the discovery of a corpse that was in Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada, his hands tied behind him and his eyes blindfolded.
The man had an injury caused by a gunshot wound to the neck.
In the middle of the month there were reports of the execution of two men who had been enveloped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the department Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Atizap<0xC3><0xA1>n of Zaragoza, at the same time two messages of death were discovered with the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony we found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario R<0xC3><0xAD>os, was sent by his ex-sécéc.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots to the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with his image were detected.
Towards the end of the month, a man’s body was found on the side of a car in Zinacantepec municipality with at least three gunshots and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads turned upside down and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, "This is what happens to those who do not align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n Colony Justice Center.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the colony Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a tape and a message next to it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez.
Near him, the officers found a bristol with a message.
China Continues Targets to Reduce Greenhouse Gases
The country’s representative at COP16 said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it is continuing its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 percent by 2020.
China continues its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16, said.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that the Chinese strategy in the field of climate change is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases, he said.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the federal authorities have worked in a coordinated way with governments and local authorities to achieve energy saving goals, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, there are various ongoing or completed multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficient Utilization Program, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another one for changing incandescent lamps by economical lamps, and another one for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific adviser to the government of this country on climate change, assured that China’s efforts have been greater than we think.
For example, he explained, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years, and plans to do another similar by 2020, he said.
Legal Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national PAN leader detailed that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is legal.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, ensured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is right.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, Espino's expulsion is a decision made at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission of Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to address himself, if necessary, by making a complaint to the National Council's Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he said.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for presidential candidacy.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez said he was convinced that the Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections on December 4 and 5, where a successor should be elected.
“This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, it has been an approach for local elections that has been successful and has reached its goal,” he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why “internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, “we enjoy it and it makes us stronger,” he said.
He said that the council would probably be able to elect the best leader(s) that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the record “to the person determined by the council.”
“I’m completely calm and open, I’d be proud to leave the party’s presidential office to any of the five.”
He predicted that the party’s re-run in the July 4th election will be reflected in the next contest, even though “it’s not yet time to think about 2012.”
"For the time being, it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments that emerge from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so there has been "a lot of hope for them", and I am sure Gabino will be on top of it.
When asked about PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n for his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the priests to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas were better than those of Fox y Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n; that they begin to defend them; that they come out of the closet,” he said.
He said that the incumbent of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no stagnation, and even less censorship.
Obama promotes law on Twitter in favor of students without papers
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to pass this legislation,” the president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today met with the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize students without papers, with a message in his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His short message maintains an open cybernetic link with a broader document that asks the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
“With a vote that is expected soon, now is the time to listen to your voice,” he said.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of Bush’s tax cuts and government funding continue.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the fiscal problem is resolved, an agenda can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this fiscal problem must be resolved by the end of the year."
"I think we can get a deal at some point in that direction and then we can plan the rest of the sequence," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would seek a “debate closing vote” for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, even if the pro-
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they remained in that country for the last five years and they were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the support of a large number of Republicans, at a time when the project’s leading organizations are lobbying intensively to ensure the passing of the Act.
Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican voiced his support for Indiana's Richard Lugar law.
This is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux, from Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who have backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but they said they were not going to back it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature we put our finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of the Language was a walk in which the participants highlighted the narration
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what do you expect from me?" asked the invited writer Luisa Valenzuela to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that has been used in other times in the past.
The finger on the wound "...we put in the embarrassment", the Argentine writer gently launched to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended by Valenzuela, Montera<0xC3><0xAD>s and Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>z.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "please" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: “Patience is not my forte, maybe it is my wound.”
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the hallway, but who explains to him that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "The wound is what is actually open, the symbolic is the scar".
The star sighed relieved and concluded: "On the wound I was only able to know that it is actually open and it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very closely related.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also exposed a delightful narrative that he titled Praise to the Invention, where the finger on the wound is not counted but at some point is discovered.
With the keys of magical realism, he spoke of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, turned people who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a lady had lost, a narration that turned to speak later to America, the great news of the beret that had taken her away from her, and the great news of the beret that had already been sent to her.
“Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) laughed at the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a helpful way we would never have told the story of America with an imagination that lacked even the pout.”
However, he pointed out, “crazy and liars have the best imagination” and here reality converges with lying, we no longer know which part of the narrative belongs to a band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is called the ‘Tradition of Cervantes’.
“It is through his legacy that we are what we are told.”
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the FIL’s invitation with its round table Le déve sur la wound.
Puerto Rican Cuba has put its focus on the great scourge of social violence that its country is going through – and Latin America is sharing – producing disputes over trafficking and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the reader.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero who also stressed "this is due to the wound of the engaged writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at great speed also in terms of intellectual habits and the control of consciousness that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every claim there is a little no and behind every negation there is a little yes."
“To be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we have to nuance: and nuance means many times to put your finger on the wound and disturb the people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance, and also to disturb the powers that prefer,” he said.
Romano in the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals he had highs and lows in his career, but he managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that face each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in the finals, he has had highs and lows in his career, but he has managed to reach three times the decisive series, even though so far he has not put in the thousand and that’s why this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentina ended up consoling themselves with the sub-champion medal, he stayed a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with an overall score of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closure he also reached the decisive duel and lost again with the overall 3–2 loss against Toluca.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback, as his team made an equal 2-2 match against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty series he got an advantage for 3-1 with two chances to win the title and three goals to win the final.
Rubén has lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, so he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to separate himself from the evil in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I'll get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," he said when asked what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, from which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can remember is that until the referee whistles the final, we can't party, we're prepared in the line, the players also, because the last time we've had two penalties to beat him, we're not going to beat him.
He knows that this series could not be defined by penalties, which we do not worry about, because he confides in his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare, the previous tournament we have been preparing for, unfortunately we have been doing the
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a subchampion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must go to Visa Applicants Service Centers prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be lower.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to appear at Visa Applicants Service Centers (ASC) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have some benefits for applicants, including the following:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to obtain an appointment, another payment for the processing of the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visa will not be required to attend an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only be present at the nearest ASC where they will present the documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be included in the CSA, applicants who wish to have a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will have less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants to the Consulates of Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the additional $26 service fee.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. Space Agency has quoted the press as presenting a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce an astrobiological discovery on Thursday that could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for astrobiology experts, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she cited the press, NASA said it would present who will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions were improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life might exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that “there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know.”
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the findings at tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan ( Saturn’s largest satellite), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and 'block' pattern opposing
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartisanism' is made possible.
The 60th had just settled when an opposing bloc led by MPs from PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo appeared in Congress, who declared themselves independent and all four questioned one thing: the arrival of ‘bipartisanism’ in the Chambers.
Before the start of the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, 'tended' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excludes them
With this reform, they reiterated, we start 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Director, chaired by PANist Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these reforms constitute the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that in the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme from a political will and if they did not, they would be enslaved again by both parties and thus end the opposition coalition.
"So far it has come (the opposition coalition), that's what I'm looking at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political will to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now "duopolistic".
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is an eternal bipartisanism in Congress.”
To begin with, this group starts with 5 lawmakers and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that now the Congress has become a 'butt' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
“Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two.”
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo asked to respect the MP’s personality, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"If they don't leave by doppelganger agreements out of 5 who will probably be 9 MPs, now to the five we see, separated into different fractions, we decided to join together to look for a place in the negotiating table, that's the problem, that in the reform that they have not agreed with us, that we have not agreed with the reform that we have done, that we have not agreed with the reform that we have done.
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The City Hall of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n pays another check to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "account settlement providers".
The treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno had said that the municipality would pay other amounts to that supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Auditor to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks “reappeared” in the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, two on 15 October, on 19 October, on 29 October and the last on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after 25 July Noroeste had published a review of the cheques that the City Hall issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the period March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, the municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be taken care of
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into a hole in the S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada roundabout, the Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n tourist sector asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Merchants Association, recalled that they have repeatedly called for the image of the destination to be taken care of and new activities to replace the others that tourists find bad.
He said the bad condition of the streets and sidewalks affected as tourists come to walk there and they see the disorder and avoid the nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t know the fortune we’re losing, elsewhere they didn’t do the work for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and avoid this happening again, how to do it, so through preventive maintenance and not just making the correction," he said.
“We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, we have to maintain it, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live there and the City Hall has to change its strategy to maintain the city well.”
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it just depends on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
“We didn’t give them the attention they needed and this type of fact highlights something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is necessary.”
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, under secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n tourist sites is urgent, as they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He talked about a number of places that need to get online together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive as it has a tourist vocation.
Fortunately Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n offers a lot of historical and cultural sites and places that should be ordered first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination.”
IP Demands Results in Congress
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members take great responsibility for being an example of a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n's business sector is seeking a dignified and uncompromising Labour Legislature between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is convulsive and faces major problems.
Yesterday we installed the 60th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 MPs from PRI, 13 from PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress are self-managed and committed with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat themselves.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members take great responsibility for being an example of a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
“We hope that the MPs actually exercise their right, free of agreement between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to safeguard their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.”
That is why I request that they certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that make the current Governor progress.
“We will make sure they do a dignified and above all committed work with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa have given them their vote of confidence in past elections.
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs.”
With regard to tourism, he requested that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
“I understood that this is the second Secretariat of the State with a lower budget and it is incongruous as important economic activity and currency generating and investment and that it competes directly with the agro-industry.”
Apart from the fact that it is necessary to classify resources into detonating tourism projects that help to reassure the state and to update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for King Mage
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the wish of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, as their home is formed by no more or less than 12 people and a flock.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble home in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day to day because their father does not have a stable job.
“Sometimes it’s very difficult for us, because my husband doesn’t have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... and in the afternoon I go out with the ‘puppies’ to sell in the street,” says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3, would like a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a ‘monster truck’ and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
“He said to me (José Alfredo), ‘I’d like to have this monster,’ but I told him ‘we’ll see, my son,’ because he was very expensive,” Cayetana recalls sadly.
For older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, 11 years old, wears size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, wears size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, wears size eight.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign On Search King Mage, giving a toy or money at the reception of Northwest.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
Dozens of searches were carried out in Istria on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Quebec Safety Authority.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including two suspected leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons were due to appear at Sherbrooke's courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place as a result of a long-awaited investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It is information received from the public that has allowed us to carry out these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the Quebec Police Department, Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department, took part in this police operation.
The illegal migration can continue without any problems.
The Conservative bill, which the government says should address the problem of illegal migrant boats, is clearly going to be beaten down as the three opposition parties said on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly support the Charter."
“I stand with a party that has created granite under your feet,” said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, as he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow anyone from a vessel identified as transporting illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because it is taking it to the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
The NDP’s immigration critic, Olivia Chow, has rejected criticism from the back of her hand that her party is not strong enough about illegal immigrants.
“The New Democrats agree to take action against smugglers and that’s what we’re doing through another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservative bill because it takes refugees and imprisons children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“Canadians are massively telling MPs they don’t tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a strawberry.”
“They expect Canada to take firm action,” said Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections that were to be rejected.
A conservative, however, told the IMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that each member who would oppose would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit is not unanimous.
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil argues that this idea does not date from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation on the matter as early as January last.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday’s announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services in Quebec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no longer necessary for the pecuniary public security critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe this announcement as a “cap out of a hat” and a “bricolated solution on the corner of a table”.
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we're going to announce it, he's just saying."
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr. Charest persists in not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people like you and me think he has something to hide," he said.
“The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he therefore suggests that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, thus enabling him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government cartons.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that jurisprudence is not explicit in this kind of investigation.
Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his fellow Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some amendments related to the matter.
During Operation Spring 2001, which struck groups of motorcyclists, although the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several streams remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has hit several parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses have been evacuated in a preventative manner.
In the evening, another slide would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell in several regions, ranging from 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain was expected by Thursday night, according to the regions.
The areas north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
As these precipitations need to be added to the already accumulated snowfall in some sectors, there is concern about the overflow of several streams.
Warnings of flood warnings were issued Wednesday evening by the Québec Civil Security for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentides, and of the Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne, in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, were subject to flood warnings and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re region, heavy rainfall resulted in the overflow of certain lakes, in Sainte-Julien, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken over due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measures.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes led to the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Crue Forecast Centre on Wednesday issued warnings of heavy floods for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, l'Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Partially Blamed Dupont
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has been partially reversing the Canadian Council of Radio Standards (CCNR) for controversial remarks on social assistance and Haitians as well as on its gross language in waves.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their views, but that some of the statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and rude language that is not suitable for broadcasts during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion of suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two people who committed suicide, did not violate the codes on broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made as a result of a complaint by the Quebec Common Front of Social Assisted Persons.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Animators need to present solid information rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, the host Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide to be a cowardly act.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life’s problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes of 'Dupont le noon' dealt with a sensitive issue in a fair and appropriate manner."
So no blame was kept in his place.
The latest dispute was about statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then turned to a face-to-face media that had provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI host said that he had made no donation to help the Haitians because one could not know with certainty that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect is an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already purged my three-day suspension on it."
"My record has been blank for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the spread of coarse language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM has collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during high-hearing hours within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montreal native of Algerian Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special route.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing rises on the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” said Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve with professionals.
“In my case, I’m looking for fights a little everywhere, because for those who don’t like the ground game present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America.”
Recently, he who works as a security agent and as a commissioner for the UPS company has just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh.
"I have won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"Right now, I'm preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
“The fighters who finished in the top four at the last World Championship in each category were invited.”
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
“In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I came third in Toronto in 2009,” he added.
“What’s interesting is that I’ve progressed in every competition.”
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where hand and foot strokes, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
The duels originally take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous pugist from this form of combat is the Vietnamese-American Cung Le, well-known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will certainly answer his presence in the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung fu.
“This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China,” explained the sympathetic guillard.
"It's kind of the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
“It was a great experience.”
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real pro," he analyzed.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals face off in the finals of their category."
"Then, the winners of each category face each other in order to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without calls for tenders
Hydro-Québec has voluntarily awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor firms that has obtained the most important, that of project management, for a sum of $295 million without tenders.
This consortium called <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance was established in 2004 at the same time as Hydro-Québec’s choice to entrust its responsibility to the private sector to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium was awarded the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing price increases.
"This is the new way to make collusion and cut down on competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, are now doing it in an open way," Peking MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said it was difficult to see how the public interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, vehemently denying that there was collusion for this contract.
“I’m starting to have my journey,” she said, arguing that the PQ had been “dishonest” and “lack of rigor.”
She said that "it would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologizes.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scope of the work.
The construction is under way and should be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the game of competition taking place; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week by Le Devoir, the formula of consortia in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overview of the Quebec business register allows you to count more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and the same legal person, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of James Bay responds to particular labor dynamics and that Hydro-Québec responds to this in a particular way since the 1970s".
The project’s chief executive, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), gave an explanation that made whispers about the fact that the project’s management contract was granted at will.
"If you go to tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say: we're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal and with a good price."
“But the idea is that it’s not the price that matters, it’s the competence of the people,” Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir had 109 engineering consultancy contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has struck 22 contracts, Genivar has won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Energy Management Contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau let down that the PQ is also tied to these firms that "finance" it, before clarifying that it was rather about its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly sceptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also in fair brands and environmental certifications to guide his choices.
Pis, even though he swims in a media universe where messages in favor of more responsible consumption pulsate, he deplores a lack of credible information, a lack that he even calls a brake on his commitment, says the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, the first reading of which was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption at Sherbrooke University.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that appear to be eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, the politicians’ speech on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, responsible consumer information appears to be essential to stimulate this bread of consumption currently fueled by nearly one-third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of the information would calm the fires of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they are as wary of the alleged performance of the green products or services they seek to put into their hands.
On another note, consumers were nearly half in 2010 to have changed their habits and especially changed the brand of one or more products to meet their belief.
At 61%, they also promoted purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food grown in their region, the Barometer says.
More green and responsible – the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year – the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by caring for the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological consciousness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers reported using public transport or recommended carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which just took its first snapshot.
A government loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to engage financially in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Angus and the Parallel, agrees to cooperate, but only in competition with a loan.
The Angus and the Parallel Development Society, which were hoping for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on St. Lawrence Boulevard by giving him his full cinematic vocation, did not get what they claimed.
The government agrees to get involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would otherwise be below the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution under favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources from the state's workshops.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and action plan were sent to the Minister of St-Pierre by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who is piloting the eXcentris dossier.
He gave her a final report about ten days ago.
But the firm’s counter-proposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the state gift really needs to be rejected.
Let us recall that the Quebec Film and Park Owners Association was opposed to a direct investment by the state to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture did not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for others.
On the contrary, several stakeholders in the environment were demanding substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the céans master, for ten years carried out the author's cinema in his premises of the complex after financing its construction himself, which could justify an exemption from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is crippling in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to solidify its clientele.
The Angus Society and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, continues to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27 by designing the very beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois of Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downside proposals that are made to them.
The veil raised over a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks raise the veil on what the U.S. views as the inferiority complex of Canadians towards Americans, but they simultaneously betray the feeling of superiority of Canadians towards Canada.
Thus, U.S. diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter doesn’t have Canada-U.S. relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the Conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, broadcast on the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, or in the midst of a federal election campaign, relates to the extent that the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great surprise of the U.S. ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
“An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may require Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of daily life rather than having this election carried over to the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign),” he writes.
The United States is, he concludes, “the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it.”
The ambassador understands all the less this "silent silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more than one party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by going to vote."
The other expression of this feeling of importance can be read in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the federal budget vote of confidence in early February, by which Canada will display its first deficit in more than a decade because of a $30-40 billion recovery plan,” Breese wrote.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series aired on CBC is returning from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are few subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or removals for CIA muscle interrogations.
Another cable reports that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he handed over a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we note that the spirits are warming up regarding the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
It was echoed by Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renovate Lighting
The United Nations has proposed a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction that corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the major concrete projects that the UN hopes will be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that monopolize still 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion Euclidean tons (Gt) would be replaced.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the global automotive park.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to drive global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to remove another 5 Gt from this balance sheet in order to stabilize the rise of the climate to 2 degrees centigrade by 2020 in order to avoid it becoming out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, is produced by light.
With fluocompact bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this need for energy is reduced twice more.
Fluocompact bulbs last on average from 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by manufacturer Philips this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a lifespan of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives a possible idea of the economy with a replacement plan.
These all-new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emit very little heat.
They do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have posted reservations at the site of fluocompact bulbs since they contain mercury and need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
But, according to the report, the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not the fluocompact bulb, but rather the coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains each country would make through this international program.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants, whose construction would cost it $2.5 billion.
C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire is nervous about the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication of the results of the presidential election in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire "without delay" after the deadline had expired.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the Electoral Commission allowed Wednesday's deadline to be passed without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's vote.
About forty minutes before the deadline had expired, the president of the IEC said on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls multiplied on Wednesday around the world for the IOC to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposing Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the Constitutional Council's cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former New Forces (FN) rebellion since the September 2002 failed coup d'état.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the Ivorian president's campaign manager, said that the intimidation of voters by the UN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo’s complaints are retained by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo opponents believe that the country’s highest court is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a Northern man who denies any connection with the former rebels, found it "unacceptable" the delay in announcing the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until he claimed the victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, on Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained divided in two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished at the top of the first round on October 31, with 38% of the vote against Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France in the sense of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (9.7% counting overseas departments), show corrected data of the provisional seasonal variations (CVS) published by the Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed persons stands at 2,631 million in metropolitan areas.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the metropolitan working population and 9.7% with DOMs.
Over the course of one year, the unemployment rate rises by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether they were looking for a job or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has further deteriorated, with a new increase in the unemployment rate, up to 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over one year) and 25% including the DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the BIT sense.
For their part, the seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 points over three months as well as one year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only the 25-49-year-olds benefited from a stability of unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 points over three months, +0.1 points over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency, on the other hand, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini put under review and placed in detention
Alexandre Guerini, 53, head of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne, was examined and crushed at the Luynes detention centre near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged public procurement.
Alexandre Guerini has been examined for abuse of social property, diversion of funds and public property, bribery, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
“Alexandre Guerini is combative and wants to explain himself to all the questions that the magistrate is going to ask him, not fantasies.”
"It's easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible bosses, it's another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, had, through his lawyers, to pass to the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined Wednesday night and collapsed.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but run the landfills he had to manage.
As for the allocation of the markets or the destination of the funds related to their operation, he has never been aware of it, said Me Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the Aubagne agglomeration, was examined Wednesday for misappropriation of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to provide explanations for the facts that are being blamed on him."
“The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of freedom,” said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been examined and released in the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with placement under judicial control for two of them, Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for “trafficking of influence and passive corruption”.
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are being examined for "suspension and diversion of public goods by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complication of diversion of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guerini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "receiving abuse of social property".
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr. Guerini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who recently collapsed in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies have served to whitewash the money of the great banditism.
The investigation is carried out as part of a number of judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous mail, for alleged fraud in the procurement of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions for the attribution and operation of a discharge from La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from certain cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysée exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spying", held the opinion in the air in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some under this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice for the treatment of their own hostage crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman had not been in return for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the US justice system for trafficking materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they place in a raw light the way the French presidency has sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French Comments on How to Manage Cases of hostages".
The Councillor of the Elysée for Strategic Affairs, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, met with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own forcibly detained citizens in Iran.
"Facts of noise," they say, "mart continuously" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocent", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it all the more as the Iranians ask you not to do it.”
Because, after attempts to talk through discreet channels, “silence will not fix anything,” the Iranians are “masters in dilatory maneuvers.”
Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day she takes refuge at the French embassy) "will require the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (230 000 euros bail).
And he makes it known that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for twelve days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose U.S. demands extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, is released in Paris, on a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks Iran’s clandestine networks of acquisitions of nuclear weapons, Majid Khakavand’s expansion is bad news.
Has France accepted a trade deal?
The liberation of Iran against that of the French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, not only "was completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision," but sought to oppose it.
“There have been lively exchanges between the French Presidency and the Seal Guard” (at the time, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but “the French government cannot return to the judicial decision,” he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of French intelligence services.
The Elysée’s adviser made up a phone number, hung up, and then informed the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian “is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy.”
During Clotilde Reiss’ detention in Iran, the Elysée does not condone its efforts, through press releases and “futures” organized in the media, to make Syrian President Bashar al-Assad play an “important” and “influential” role as a “mediator.”
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that manipulation bears its fruit since several press articles affect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
On what is the basis of so much "gratitude" expressed towards Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris is asking.
“Despite their statements full of praise, French officials privately recognize that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then looks at the reasons that prompted the Elysée to pour into this fiction.
The intense communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening up Syria," he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which “had then been perceived by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and untimely.”
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris seeks to “demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “seed seeds of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything."
“But we thanked them anyway.”
“It should at least sow confusion among Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriots".
No online games for young Koreans last midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a so-called “Cendrillon” law that will ban teens from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under 16 years of age, said representatives of the ministries of culture and the family.
“A lot of kids play these games all night and then have trouble studying at school and having a normal life during the day.”
“We believe this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep,” Jo Rin, the department’s head of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit daily access to these games for young people whose parents apply for them, he added.
It will also make it available to people who demand it free software that allows you to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, compared to 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA designates the host countries
In the midst of turmoil over suspicions of corruption, FIFA’s executive committee on Thursday designated the 2018 and 2022 World Cup host countries, an eminently political choice where the struggles of influence and lobbying risk taking a step on technical criteria.
One thing is for sure, the 2018 edition of the competition Queen of FIFA will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 one will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities from the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emirate of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political issues of a Mound.
Therefore, behind-the-scenes treatments are likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to FIFA’s assessment report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh too heavily for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the source of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined his country’s chances, the birthplace of football that only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC released a documentary featuring three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What dissatisfaction with FIFA and embarrassing the English officials, who have launched themselves into intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of the government hopes to re-edit the successful blow by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the London 2012 Olympic Games in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to re-enforce England's blazon with the EC?
Nothing is less certain as the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack assets with its already ready stadiums, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of the two countries could smother their ambitions.
Any reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's rating, becoming an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings of its record (stages, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the move to Zurich and denounced a "loyal competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the English press's accusations against EC members.
“We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them,” Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appears as the logical favorites.
The world’s first economic powerhouse, home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to have a long lead on Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear to be premature for two countries that co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the World Cup-2026 to China, eagerly desired by FIFA, which would in fact make Asian chances for 2022 lapse.
With Qatar, which has released the big game by offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of the TV rights paid (due to the time lag) by European countries, the core of the war for FIFA.
The Second Mandate: The Evidence
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
A mandate to the Elysee calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not do well with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
So we have to act as if the doubt still exists.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even unbelievably, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, with severe weather, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011".
That he speaks to MPs at the Elysée on Tuesday evening, the prospect of "two mandates" has therefore seeded a bit of feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were a long way from here.
The President only recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He was making a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that he has spoken of the president, on the tone of humor, in such meetings.
“At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me,” he told them in July 2009.
Rebelled in May 2010: "Don't believe I'm not thinking at the next stage."
His words of yesterday do not make him more candidate than the day before; they do not make him less.
If they make comments, that’s for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race to the candidacy for the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the entry into the league of Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, because his 2012 candidacy is evident that many in the PS call for an early-than-expected battle settlement.
The wrong polls, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP about it," the Prime Minister said immediately and cautiously.
“If he believes defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate,” said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," said Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain its purchases of state securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was supposed to be an opportunity to clarify the way out of the crisis or, at least, to announce the end of a number of unconventional monetary policy operations that must be completed by the end of the year.
As the European sovereign debt crisis obliges, the Frankfurt Emissions Institute will no doubt not be able to afford to be as peremptory as it is to aggravate a situation more than it is today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role played by the ECB in helping to resolve the European sovereign debt crisis.
She did not want to say whether she felt that the central bank should do more, e.g. by increasing its program of purchasing sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...) ".
On the eve of its hearing in Brussels by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show himself any more dissatisfaction with his intentions, merely stating that the programme for the purchase of State securities in the secondary market "would "continue" and that we "would"
The only certainty: the ECB will keep its main management rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB’s purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week, to nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have bought for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that the expectations of a continuation of purchases are met (see page 29).
Economists also do not expect a significant change of direction.
If loan operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this arrangement to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine that she's significantly changing her program."
“Otherwise, it would be taking the risk of causing new short-term tensions,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
“A progressive release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” said Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these bonds to animate a smooth market,” adds Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
“He needs to replace himself at all costs with the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the packaging of returns paid by the most fragile states,” a senior bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates fly, the states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, otherwise stabilize it.
The security of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government turns its back
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation calmed down a little yesterday, with the 10-year bond rate rebound.
A return to precarious calm.
When leaving a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which the interested party later denied.
On Tuesday in any case, the gap with German long rates had reached the record of 210 basis points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had flown to 263 points, leading to some downturn in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German rates was greater than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said it was "strongly concerned" by "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” said Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atony of tax revenues that goes with it, causing the state to run the risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecast for Brussels has been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under review in the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget group that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," said Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
For the time being, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
“The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
“There is no problem immediately, either in the short term or in the long term, because despite its significant debt (118.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilisation efforts requested in Italy are less than those requested in other countries,” notes Pier Carlo Padoan, economist at the OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which early elections could be held at the end of March.
There would then be a period not conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis systems
Christine Lagarde also hammered her yesterday as part of a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe, have yet to demonstrate it on Sunday in the day and in the night, are obviously supportive, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of European government obligations brought water to the mills of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet talk about the beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt rating, the most targeted target today by speculation.
“As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs in particular on banking systems,” says economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
All the more so as "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
And this is also in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the outcome of non-conventional support measures for euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform the far-eastern investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground for it.
The first issue of EFSF securities is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters the U.S. would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries that are at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in terms of the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are in addition to austerity measures with closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path than those of Greece and Ireland.
One and the other, at all costs, is to avoid seeking international assistance before setting up their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms that are necessary to restore lasting trust.
Finally, European donors are talking about the options available to speed up the process of standardisation of sovereign bond markets.
On 24 November, Axel Weber first came up with the idea that if the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the EU would not hesitate to hand it over to the portfolio.
The economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would suffice, “preferably” in the form of a direct injection of cash.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with, to date, EUR 60 billion.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions are getting worse.
Snow and glass: 24 orange watch departments
Snowfall still causes traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and risks disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and verglas.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and Vienna, added to the 20 departments already in orange alert, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Meteo France, sustained snowfalls affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows poorly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
Snowfalls are notable enough to generate traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, several departments were banned at a weight of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to gendarmes who recommend taking their vehicle only in case of necessity and the traffic of certain TER cars was suspended for the day.
School transports were banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the circulation of heavy weights.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly."
The Civil Aviation Directorate (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25 percent of their flights to Paris Roissy Airport on Thursday and 10 percent to Orly due to future snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: First Financial Sketches
Since the time when the debate around the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has come to a head, billions have been crying.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion is mentioned for the Grand Paris metro that the Société du Grand Paris has to build.
To start this SGP, the state announced a capital allocation of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this amount that will then allow the SGP to borrow on the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Finance Bill, which was reviewed by the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements to find the beginning of this money.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, section 15, is "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is digitized: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a refurbishment of an office tax that already exists "in order to modernize it, increase its product and assign this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that cost?
Mysteries.
It is not enumerated in the text.
We're a long way from $4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are added to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion capital allocation that will be mobilised by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," the statement reads.
At SGP, we can't find this shocking system.
"From the moment we create revenue (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies over three years and then tap into the 4 billion after that," he said.
"It will be included in the budget and shot as it progresses."
The SGP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the 4 billion promised are still for the absent subscribers, risks causing a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Avengers and Spy in Diligence Hackers
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it turns out to be an apparent scandal, a scandal that only appears as a scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and predicts a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every file made up of a secret service (of any nation) is made up exclusively of press releases.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what could be read in any newspaper (except those that Berlusconi owns), and Khadafi's sinisterly caricature profile has long been for sketch cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should only be composed of known news is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore devoted to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous books.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unprecedented research (and does not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who are devoted to occultism believe only in what they already know, and which reaffirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown’s success.
I'm going for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or with a limited mind) the head of the secret services (otherwise it could be, as far as I know, editor at Liberation), who retains as true only what he recognizes.
Top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as that Newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since heads of state can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in the center of the country, they have lost their diplomatic function.
Any investigative film viewer knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to place American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the world’s most powerful country’s most secretive secrets carries a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Also, the scandal does not put the victims as much into crisis as the “burreaux”.
But let’s get to the deep nature of what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell’s time, one could conceive of any power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been fully proven since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's revenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that knowing everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it belongs to the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks has done to him, all the secrets of Cly de Hill are hidden.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it has done too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to put any reserved information online - this would be to publish it on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it’s just as obvious as with current technologies, it’s vain to hope to be able to maintain confidential phone reports.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How will private and reserved relations be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the time being, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligence on uncontrollable routes, being only bearers of messages learned from the heart or, at the very least, in information.
The information will be kept in a single copy in key-closed drawers: in the end, the attempt to spy on Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now advancing in crabs, that is to say, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a telegraph on wires (telephones).
The (analog) video cassettes had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going back and forth and discovering all the secrets of editing, while now the (digital) CDs only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the trips it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication techniques go back to horse-drawn cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secret of embassies.
Now it is the embassies that are requesting confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France contributes to its funding pledges
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to review the compliance with the promises of rapidly-unlocked funding (so-called fast start or early funding) made by developed countries.
And the big French boxing is revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU released the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast-start finance: report detailing the action of its member states, press conference, big side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is valued and valued at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen Agreement, "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States of which France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference year: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years to fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of level of public development assistance.
On the contrary, France believes that the funding for "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditures of previous years or the overall level of public development assistance.
In concrete terms, France’s total support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to “new and additional” funding...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
There again, there is no rule and everyone chooses his or her method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 loaned is equivalent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 given.
Of course, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is necessary to present a euro that is to be recovered as a euro equivalent to a euro that is being given interest).... At the very least, the country should not be obliged to pay the amount of the loan.
But France only has to make such a reasoning: it “respects” its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros) – see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only EU country to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) fulfill their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the very large majority of the European Union puts <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to meet its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice pass-by tour!
In short, in its fast-start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of action over time and on the other on the reality of financial effort.
By spending only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million, she succeeds in believing that she spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with her promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not complete.
The early funding chapter is just a small, relatively short-term issue compared to the whole of climate discussions.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the immense machine that is UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting system for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with other European Union countries.
But above all, France could advance discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): one will not escape the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast start and its vision of “additionality” and the use of loans would naturally increase the level of international confidence needed to advance in the discussions.
Warning to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the Association Generations Futures (ex-Movement for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with", bought between July and September the foods usually consumed in four meals and a snack in one day in Paris by a child's supermarket.
These typical meals, including the official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as snacks, were examined by laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens, and five are classified as certain carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors, according to studies from several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individual chemical taken are not exceeded, we can see in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is worrying," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogen residues and three proven as certain carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues that may disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack by the study, has traces of six chemicals, one of which is still banned in France.
The same is true for Kenya’s green beans, including lunch, where the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the roasted steak, the tuna in the box, and even the bread baguette and chewing gum were truffled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the plastic plate examination used to heat the microwave meal was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumer of this "contaminant cocktails" "is probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "face to the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "increased civilizational diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
