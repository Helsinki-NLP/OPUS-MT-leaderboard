The stock market in Prague has been downgraded at the end of the trade
The stock exchange in Prague corrected its losses after the morning thunderstorm.
Transactions with the shares of the Czech Energy Industry Enterprise (<0xC4><0x8C>EZ) accounted for almost half of the usual daily trading.
The stock market in Prague continued Monday’s decline from the very beginning of Tuesday’s trade, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, Wall Street’s shares are falling behind the decline.
This is how the market reacts to the vote of the US House of Representatives, which has refused to support the stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
The decline in shares in Asia
The Asian stock market experienced a dramatic fall in shares on Tuesday, although the indicators during the day eventually wiped out part of the losses.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng stock index recorded almost four percent of the trade, but later wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decline to around 2.5 percent.
On the Hong Kong stock market, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors Chinese stocks, fell 3.8 percent, and markets were closed in Shanghai.
Shares in the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five per cent, but eventually fell to 4.3 per cent of losses.
Taiwan’s stock market fell 3.6 percent, according to the index.
"The timing of the U.S. bailout is uncertain and affects the world's financial markets," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said U.S. lawmakers should immediately re-open the negotiations and accept a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a threat that other countries will also feel the consequences.
The Blood Bath of American Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which should have been converted to $700 billion (nearly 12 billion crowns).
The legislators also ignored President George W. Bush’s call for support of the plan.
Bush said the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks underwent a bloodbath, and the leading stock indexes recorded the biggest dip in 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell by almost seven percent, with a similar decline last experienced in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal was not accepted in the House of Representatives, the index began to be released.
Congress backs down: U.S. government could pump $700 billion into banks
The heads of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement and financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
This will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
The U.S. lawmakers have committed a breach in the negotiations to approve the bailout plan in the form of financial assistance to the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (approximately SEK 12 billion).
But there's no victory yet.
The Congress, for its part, must complete some of the details of the agreement before it can make public the final form and vote of the law.
The support plan for the financial system will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
This was reported by Reuters news agency on Sunday by Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee on Financial Organizations.
According to sacred sources, the plan is likely to be voted on as early as Wednesday.
According to the auditors, there should be a notification that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important mental factor in the revival of the money markets.
Thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms, however, after this, there will be "exition".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have taken a big step.
We have resolved our differing views on what the form of the package to stabilise the market should be,” said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat with the Bloomberg Agency.
He said the final vote could be held on Sunday.
On Saturday night, lawmakers met with Henry Paulson, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, to give a final form of government funding.
This should buy up unsold tangible assets from financial companies, which are putting financial companies at serious loss and jeopardizing the stability of the entire system.
“We are close to the final agreement on a plan that will work and that should be effective in the market at the same time.
The improvement plan still needs to be continued, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
The Sign of Asian Trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the equity markets, which are falling sharply.
Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, said lawmakers are trying to make a final deal in Congress on Sunday.
This is because they want to reassure investors before the start of trading in Asian money markets, where the Congress’ decision to trade on Monday could be the first to affect the time zone.
It is not yet clear, however, that the two chambers of the U.S. Congress are voting on the law, as is the case, whether the trial can be postponed at the last moment due to some problem.
The legislators hope that the law will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, is going through a lot of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system must be divided into two parts.
According to President George Bush’s request, the first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount, which was set at an additional $100 billion and later at $350 billion, if it has the feeling that the program is not functioning.
Bush Appreciates the Progress in Negotiations
Although the President may veto this decision, the Congress may, however, override its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remained, which was to acquire financial instruments for the purchase of bad securities that lost their value, as hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to remove their tokens.
"We worked out everything.
The House should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said in a statement.
With the progress made in the negotiations, President Bush was also satisfied.
Tony Fratto, Bush’s spokesman, said the president was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and appreciated the “bilateral efforts made to stabilise our money markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of final bus service
Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said lawmakers had agreed on the responsibility for the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of concessions, and the timing of the funding.
The new law also limits the final satisfactions of the bus managers involved in the program and creates a committee to oversee the fund.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this and have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and will be useful to all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also counts on the help provided to the homeowners who have a problem with the deletion.
The government should issue new wiper parts for the labels it has purchased, with the aim of reducing the monthly wiper parts of taxpayers and allowing them to maintain their homes.
Brand: Spiritual Help
The proposed plan by David Marek, the leading economist at Patria Finance, is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
“This is because it is not possible to know what mechanism the problematic assets will be purchased at and at what price.
This will be decisive in how the financial sector and the government share the losses among each other," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
According to Mark, it is not so important that the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week.
“It’s much more important that Congress decide this week that they support the plan and, as soon as possible, give their blessing.
The spiritual importance of having an agreement on whether the plan will be approved is the most important thing at the moment," said Marek.
Fighting on the verge: MP3 players versus mobiles.
We help you to choose
While almost all mobiles are capable of playing MP3 files, no MP3 player can be phoned.
It seems clear that it is better to just buy a phone.
However, there are many reasons why a person can get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the needs of the prospective owner.
It’s probably hard to get a high-end home recording player to listen to that latest Maxim Turbulenc record.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear on baking sheets, but from a quality point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if your shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues baking tapes, then you probably dream of such a record player.
This is similar to the one intended for travel, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For some, it may be unacceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan is likely to find it difficult to accept a 20-crown market listener.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The lifespan of the elements also matters
Some top-notch music players are capable of much more than simply playing music, but also of something that most mobiles don’t even happen to.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phone call and text messaging, you can also play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera, and even navigate.
And if you take smartphones and communicators into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can take photos.
There are also drawbacks to multi-functional mobile.
The more features you use on your mobile phone, the more times the display sends to the charger.
And music playing is one of the biggest energy regulators.
Few mobile devices are able to play music for longer than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this regard, the music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly higher in performance.
For low-cost mobiles, expect that they won’t be playing for you for more than a few hours.
In addition, if you’re even on the phone here, get a charger for your workplace for the sake of safety – this also applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players won’t have such a problem, even the worse ones will have at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one charge.
The next problem arises when uploading music to mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector and in addition, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, the music can be attached directly to the memory card, but only a few card readers struggle with miniature memory cards used in mobile phones without an adapter.
With a few exceptions (iPod) for players, you don’t need any special software.
It is enough to charge the device from the computer with music via USB.
Most of the mobiles and players have already created their own music library based on the performer, the name of the album, the genre, or, for example, the user’s rating.
Some devices only depict a tree structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are more manageable, mobiles know more
When selecting a specific device, you will be interested in the battery life, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output, and of course the convenience of the treatment.
If your music primarily serves as a background for you and you only listen to it for a short time each day, for example, on the power station, any MP3 player mobile is also suitable for you.
In fact, any cell phone can do that.
You don’t even have to pay particular attention to what music formats your mobile or player knows.
All MP3s will be played, and the vast majority of the music that will be coming to you will be in this format.
MP3 is one of the most widely used, and in addition to it, the vast majority of devices also cope with WMA-format music.
AAC (the format used by Apple and iPod) is less common.
Better mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough to visit the appropriate pages of the provider (or other provider) through the mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service in itself can be a compelling argument for the acquisition of a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the provider’s offer is vague and usually limited to one-year radio waves.
The prices are not the lowest.
In general, however, it can be assumed that such a mode of sale of music (either on GSM, the Internet, or over the wireless Internet) will dominate the music market in the future.
The majority of people keep their mobile devices with them all the time.
Whenever you want to listen to something, your mobile will pop out of your pocket while the forgotten MP3 player is hovering at home.
However, it still depends on whether you are always carrying the headphones or at least the speakers with you.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that almost every mobile phone has, but only a few MP3 players.
For many, music mobiles will probably be the biggest advantage of the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand kronor.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get a decent walkman.
However, most of the time, you are limited by the lack of a traditional listener’s output.
The best and most equipped phones from the technical point of view can reach up to fifteen thousand crowns with the traditional 3.5 mm diameter hole earphones.
At the same time, the advantage of the players is the ease of handling.
The simplest - by no means necessarily with the treatment of the cheapest players (see our selection) really everyone is struggling.
A minimal function, the previously usual handling similar to magno or gramophone, is obvious.
There is no threat of a breakdown in the form of a mobile internet that is accidentally turned on, nor of the huge account that follows it for data transmission.
Which device to choose
The cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have openings for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
The purchase of the appropriate card also includes a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic types only support cards with a maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones know what to do with up to 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and even want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowont, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Irivert.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) you do not need to spend more than 1 100 kroons.
If you belong to the more demanding students, choose special mobile walkers (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, thus bringing the convenience of handling closer to the MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson has become the most popular in the industry, with its walkman-series mobiles having the same user interface as the separately sold MP3 players.
MP3 players of the above mentioned brands can provide the same service in the same price category up to 4,000 crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively developed and our providers offer practically the same services as their Western European partners.
However, there is one thing we lack here - a virtual provider that forces classic providers to significantly lower prices.
Maybe it won't be that long.
On Mobil.cz we have written many times that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which drew attention to the fact that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in other EU countries.
Following the latest move by the European Commission to regulate roaming charges, there may be a conflicting situation - some of the Czech mobile service providers' customers' SMS messages sent from abroad will be cheaper than those sent from their home countries.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really wants to get into the fight.
This may sound contradictory, since we have three mobile networks and our penetration is well above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile providers would like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, president of the Czech Telecommunications Office Council, has often agreed that there is no place for new providers in the Czech Republic.
Perhaps it is true that the classical provider probably does not have too many chances with its own network (but it would probably be difficult to find a frequency).
But there is one more option - the virtual provider.
The move by virtual providers to the mobile market has led to a significant drop in prices, after which classical providers have also had to react.
In the meantime, even before the big fish market, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile in the UK, sounds similar to ours were heard.
However, it has been proven that such providers have a place and can truly be successful.
However, for example, we do not have to go too far.
This February, we informed you about the launch of Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland.
In less than half a year, this service provider has managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest service provider there.
Meanwhile, behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group, which owns the U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual providers is the ability to focus on a much narrower target group.
In order to operate effectively, you need far fewer customers than the traditional service provider.
It does not have a relatively high cost of construction, mobile network management and maintenance.
Virtual providers in the world thus usually appear as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and text messages, which, however, are often counterbalanced by fewer services.
For example, the UK-based Tesco Mobile offers at least fifty percent cheaper text messages than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, a good draw can also be accepted for such a target group.
This service is specifically focused on men.
“The real men choose the Mobilking service provider – who they like, who they can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which runs this virtual service provider.
It is difficult to say whether an idea similar to Poland can work out in our country.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD>, spokesperson for Vodafone, said: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which the majority of virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfied in terms of the provision of services."
Unexpected in the Czech Republic, mobile service providers say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is some virtual provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic, the agreements do not seem too hopeful.
To start Mobilking is more likely to happen in other countries of our region," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ko, a spokesman for the Penta financial group, told Mobil.cz.
In doing so, he confirmed that the existing mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not too familiar with this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competition can be created.
For some time now, the GTS Novara Group has not been keeping its interest in launching a virtual service provider, which would like to take another step towards making Telefonica O2 a true competitor in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in not only providing our customers with wired, but also mobile telecommunications services.
The sooner, the better.
We have discussed this possibility again and again with all Czech mobile providers.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
Maybe there's a better time.
From unofficial information, it seems that for the first virtual provider, we may be lucky by the end of the year.
However, his birth is surrounded by an impenetrable listening wall.
“At the moment, we don’t think that a full-fledged virtual provider would have a place in the Czech market.
The Czech market, unlike the other markets, is very special.
So far, we have not been invited to a single, complex and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, press officer of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica 02, told Mobil.cz.
Other providers also refer to the special situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokesman for T-Mobile, said: “So far, we have not recorded a single viable and bilaterally advantageous business project on which we can continue to rely.”
And he added: “In the T-Mobile network by the end of the year it is unlikely that any virtual provider will appear.
At this moment, there should be a concrete agreement on our table so that we can think about it in such a short time."
Instead, Vodafone pays attention to meeting its own 3G licensing requirements.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are excited about negotiations with possible virtual providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
From the point of view of customers, this is what we consider to be the most cost-effective.
Vodafone’s main strategy is to partner in this area to build networks that share the fast mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - one line with the providers
The procedure of mobile service providers is easy to understand, the entry of another service provider would mean an increase in competition, a decrease in price and thus a decrease in their profits.
So why should we make it easier to enter such a competition?
When a service provider is able to work together on something important, it also bears witness to the chaos surrounding the birth of the U:phone.
The biggest pressure on <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was probably the birth of T-Mobile’s U:phone.
This is evidenced by the information publicly available from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> website.
But right now, the U:fon comes up with a good argument as to why we don’t allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> added: "The environment of the mobile market's competition has recently been affected by the entry of the fourth mobile provider market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of a new player into the market and its services would be based on high requirements."
However, given the attitude of mobile service providers, the total disinterest of the Czech regulators is directly amazing.
Meanwhile, it is not only the attitude of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately - unlike the UK and other developed countries - has no right to interfere in the economic competition.
It is exclusively entitled to do so by the Economic Competition Authority.
But, of course, the office is related to the whole problem.
"The move to the mobile market of a virtual service provider would only be possible if the contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider were to be concluded on the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, since the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting to traditional providers," said Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chlapua, from the Department of External Relations of the Economic Competition Authority.
A statement made in this way from the representatives of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the office, which should represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, ensure that no one can live back to their market situation, it is more than strange.
Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: “In a country where virtual providers usually work, we can see that our market share has contributed to the reduction in the price of mobile phone services.”
However, it is likely that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS’ interests do not fall under the pressure of the proper functioning of the market environment and of price reductions.
In this case, it is really shocking that the three mobile service providers’ reactions are completely compatible.
The question of whether it is really just an accident is almost self-evident.
Just as in filling stations, gasolines that are exactly the same are probably just works of random and hard competition.
"The Office has not disclosed the signs of the anti-competitive procedure in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the providers has a leading position, i.e. they do not have a proportionally greater responsibility for their market activities.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual providers are likely to be missing from the telecommunications regulator as well," Chalupa said.
The presentation of the market leadership situation is one of the many points of discussion.
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, on the basis of which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
After such a market, of course, there is not a single Czech provider in a leading position.
However, some legal experts also offer a different perspective - the creation of a virtual provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile service provider - relatively logically - has a monopoly on its own network.
So, in a certain segment, it is necessarily dominant.
But even if we do not accept this argument, there should be a minimum incentive for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile service providers behave in a similar manner.
Meanwhile, the complaints of a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned GTS Novara company) show that they encounter very similar obstacles during the course of the negotiations with all providers.
The reassignment of responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS takes its hands off the whole case.
We have met with this in a number of similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted telecommunications law, the extension of the scope of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the field of economic competition in telecommunications was not possible, although many experts hoped to improve the situation.
The representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS need to know this well, but they probably have other interests.
It works when no one is listening.
Meanwhile, the operation of some kind of virtual service providers remains unnoticed, many of which already operate in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their own mobile phone service price lists, which, however, are only partially public.
They are multi-level marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the selected ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic corporate customer against the provider, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an outstanding customer, you will then receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile service providers prohibit similar prepayments.
"If there were any cases that we are talking about, it could be a breach of contract conditions that we are dealing with and which could lead to the termination of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> said in a statement.
But it is unlikely that news of this kind of activity would not have reached the people responsible for the mobile service providers.
In particular, the three companies mentioned can be referred to as several thousand customers.
In the meantime, no provider will defend against such a procedure.
Because of the activities of these companies, they do not have negligible profits, and, unlike real virtual providers, they do not, in particular, threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns of possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by the negligible percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card is not in their name on their phone, so they can’t have it in full, like the general customers of mobile service providers.”
But that's what the <0xC4><0x8C>TU should at least be curious about.
In addition, another question arises for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile service providers are faced with a similar procedure, why do they prevent the birth of a virtual service provider?
It should be noted that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has a relatively strong right to disclose such activity and, if it does not want to, it should not be satisfied with the explanation of the providers that they have not done so and that their trading conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As has already been said a few times in the text, the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market has led to a noticeable decrease in the price of services.
In the meantime, in virtually every country where virtual service providers were created, the classic service providers tried to prevent them from being created more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically the same - too small, perhaps too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the developed countries, however, regulators intervened at this very moment, which in no way protected the interests of mobile service providers but their customers.
Then, either by formal measures or by informal pressure, they reached the conclusion that the first virtual provider was created, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators have given the whole case to each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclear competences are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual provider is really coming up soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the providers would allow the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS can hardly remain indifferent to the refusal of further interested parties (to discriminate).
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may not be able to make more expensive calls.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four revisions of the new version of the Czech State Anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>n celebrated the Czech State Day to present the new recordings of the State Anthem of the Czech Republic.
The anthem and the National Theatre were recorded by Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available - with male or female soloists, with vocals or instrumentals.
Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>inkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka sing.
Authors Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz website.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers the Czech national anthem one of the most beautiful.
He told Czech Radio earlier that he had deliberately chosen young, representative vocal singers who were expressive and popular in order to sing the solo variations.
"From the very beginning, both of them, and later, I tried to take care of pure diction, the comprehension of the text and the harmony," he said.
The Czech National Anthem is celebrating its 175th anniversary this year.
The song "Where Is My Country?" was first performed at the Rendi Theatre in 1834 in Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka, supplemented by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>krup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously viewed it as their own.
After the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse of the song became a natural part of the state anthem.
Even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic, one of the seven state symbols remained.
What is the “new” anthem?
For the first time, the Prague transport company will also ship with a chip card on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, he entered the history of the Prague Transport Company as the first passenger to enter the metros, trams and buses, whose electronic coupon will be in his pocket instead of a paper line sign.
The coupon can currently be purchased for around one hundred thousand people who have an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual voucher (which will be valid from January 1, 2009) and can also save to their chip card in the information centers and facilities of the Transport Company in the Museum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0x88><0xC5><0x88><0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l
The coupons can be purchased online from yesterday through the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers in the afternoon hours.
Those who are beginning to use internet commerce can finally forget about the station’s publishing houses, where they have had to carry out regular long lines for the lines.
The coupon can be purchased via the Internet and is also credited to the Opencard card in one of the thirteen accounts of the City Library.
“In these places, passengers are provided with a desk with trained servers that will help those interested in online shopping and also save their purchased coupons on their cards,” said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, a spokesman for the project.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can be saved to Opencard in some self-service vending machines equipped in the front halls.
What do these machines look like?
Pirosak is reminiscent of the ticket managers and passengers may have already noticed them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovicka, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but it should be 80 by the end of the year," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
The coupon is automatically checked by the driver instead of the driver.
It is easy to manage the machines that will start tomorrow.
Just insert the Opencard card and the previously paid coupon will save you from yourself.
Electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area from tomorrow.
So on the trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants of the Central Czech Republic mainly travel to the capital.
"On trains classified in Prague for integrated transport, the drivers were seen with card readers, which also help to determine the zone validity of the vouchers," explained Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal from the Prague public transport schedule.
In the buses around the city, the card readers at the driver's desk are installed at the cash desk.
Therefore, when entering, the driver must not only show the chip card, but also place the Opencard in a place specified on the side of the wallet.
In this way, the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"For example, if the passenger needs to check the validity of the vouchers, it is easiest to ask the driver for this," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal added.
Passengers who do not travel by bus around the city and will not remember the validity of their coupon when it expires can go back to the self-service vending machines that save the coupons on cards.
Information about the validity of their documents can be found here on the device display.
The Saudis wanted a referendum from the United States.
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans asked <0xC5><0xA0>umava to join the United States.
This comes from the letter that is in the collection of the Scientific Library in South Bohemia.
If we are not part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
It is said that in 1945 some groups of Germans turned to the President of the United States.
This is also apparent from a surviving letter from a private archive, which is currently kept in the collection of the Scientific Library in South Bohemia.
<0xC4><0x8C>esky Krumlov’s Germans in the letter asked the US president not to allow the return of the “<0xC5><0xA0>umavai County” to the Czech Republic, which Hitler still occupied under the Munich Treaty.
"We have interpreted the situation correctly and we really want to be sure of the words that the American troops come to the German territories in no way as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter reads, "People who are at their heart."
As the connection to Czechoslovakia can give the Sudeten Germans, supposedly - in addition to the knowledge of the Czech national character - only brutality, intolerance, lack of understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter call upon the United States
“We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million people, this territory would be judged by us as a foreign country, which would condemn and infuriate the minority, and with almost nothing would contribute to the victory of the Allies,” the letter said.
The reason why the authors could not sign, is allegedly a fear of the “Czech repression” of revenge.
So if the president of the United States allegedly doubted the opinion of the Germans in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava region, it would be enough to hold a referendum on whether the people of <0xC5><0xA0>umava County want to become part of the United States and whether they want to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem a bit na<0xC3><0xAF>ve to the current knowledge of post-war history, according to some historians, it adequately reflects the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to at least feel that they would be dislodged from the country, few of them knew the possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would be in some sort of autonomy for the Saudis.
Once again, others believed that they would simply stay in the Czech Republic.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
During the war, Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea as a German naval officer in Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
When the British were captured at the end of the war and taken to the Holstein concentration camp, dozens of other Czechs joined the German army to teach them Czechs.
"They were confident that if they came home, they would be able to speak the Czech language," Chalupa said.
Before the war, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia believed that they were being resettled from the country on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
The emotional campaign is attacking the leaders.
In the history of the Czech Republic, it is the most expensive road safety action.
In this way, it would be possible to characterize the media campaign that affects the emotions, which the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s office hopes this campaign will rid the leaders of the dangerous behavior behind the government.
The 150 million-strong campaign will be broadcast on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on soap operas.
Drivers should be alerted to speeding and alcohol.
And you should also remind them to shut down their security belts before they start.
Above all, young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers want to speak to their conscience.
And what does it show up in the ads?
Emotions are attacking, primarily human stories.
This is evidenced by the slogan "bloody" of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The term "don't think" is written in large letters on the license plate.
And there's the word "pay" in the blood drawer.
This must be a sign that a man can pay for a moment of inattention with his life.
Audiences will be "shocked" by the commercials until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by campaigns similar to those of the Anglo-Saxon countries, where drastic images of victims of accidents are regularly seen.
It is hoped that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The ads were created by the Euro RSCG agency.
Pull it out, pull it out for the drivers
"The 'pull, pull, pull' system on the drivers is valid.
The 'get it' for them is, for example, when they go through the red, thus saving time.
The 'punish' is the danger of punishment or accident.
The driver should be reminded of the risk," says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n, a transport psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need an information campaign in the press, especially a negative campaign, the psychologist believes.
He believes that the driver's attention to the danger table is less effective.
“If a hazard warning board is equipped, it will likely soon come into contact with the environment and the drivers will not deal with it,” Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmer, the president of the provisional Israeli government, spoke of the return of virtually all occupied territories in 1967, namely the West Bank of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview published on Monday by the Jedi Achrono daily.
“We have to stand with the Palestinians, which means that almost all, if not all, of the (inhabited) areas, must be returned,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we must hand over a similar percentage of the Israeli territories to the Palestinians, because there will be no peace without them,” he added.
He acknowledged that the possible return would include East Jerusalem as well.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and especially wants tractors and bulldozers not to go through on their feet, as happened to one of my best friends, must give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert said, noting that two cities of July had been attacked and had been attacked.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution to the Temple Mount, sacred and historic places" in the Old City.
“Whoever wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the entire city, must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he stressed.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed an opinion on the withdrawal of the Israelis from the Golan Heights, which he said was an indispensable condition for the peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose a peace treaty with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know well what they have to give up in order to get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with the Hezbollah (Syria Movement); they must give up the regular support provided by Hamas (Syria Movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (Holy War) terrorism in Iraq at the mini-point.
Questions after an accident: Is it illegal for passengers on buses?
The law doesn't know them, you can't go on a long-distance bus
With regard to the tragic bus balance of the Student Agency company, the question arose in the vicinity of the Italian Padova whether passengers and passengers can travel on the bus during the journey.
“If we want to comply with the law strictly and formally, the passenger’s activities are in violation of the traffic laws,” said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The death of a twenty-two-year-old passenger last week was likely caused by a truck driver crossing the road by a bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver at the moment, in the least safe place on the bus, although he had two more seats.
The bus can crash or suddenly stop even at the moment when the passenger serves up coffee or offers a newspaper.
It has a role to play in determining whether the bus is equipped with a parking lot under the traffic permit.
If the bus is not homologated, passengers must sit.
The distance buses of the Student Agency do not have a stand, which is confirmed by Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz by Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, the director of the company.
"We tried to find a solution to this with the ministry, and at first they did not allow the movement of passengers.
However, this was withdrawn and we got to the point that passengers can go to the toilet during the trip if they have their own seat," he said.
The law does not recognize the passenger.
"There is no clear legal regulation on the role of a passenger - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no law prohibits the carrier from providing the services.
The law on road traffic only knows the concept of the vehicle carrier; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds Hanselka, a spokesman for the company.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, director of the Department of Road Vehicle Management at the Ministry of Transport, on the contrary, believes that the law is handling the problem properly.
"It depends on whether the bus has a parking space in the driver's license.
And that's over," he says.
According to their distinction, buses can be urban, where there are parking spaces and are limited to the maximum speed, as well as between them, with parking spaces and allowed higher speed, as well as distance without parking spaces and allowed with maximum speed, safety
As on the plane, says the expert
Jaroslav Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n, BESIP’s traffic safety expert, sees no fundamental problem in the movement of passengers on board the bus.
"During continuous progress, there is not much danger, we can compare the situation to the service on the aircraft.
It's not even safe here when there's turbulence and the airman can hit his head."
“But if the bus suddenly stops, of course, the physical laws are valid.
Just like in city buses or trams.
The safety of passengers must be solved by the carrier’s internal rules,” he says and also believes that the problem has not been solved from the point of view of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura ready to discontinue services
The Student Agency offers passenger services as the only bus carrier in the country.
He's got two hundred passengers.
The Director does not consider their employment to be at risk after the accident.
"As well as the impression that the occupation of passengers is risky, I will also stop.
Coffee and newspapers are available upon check-in by passengers.
It would also be a cost savings,” he says.
In his vehicles, he justified the lack of passengers with security interests, Alexej Litvin, the director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of flights compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have any passengers, we've been resisting this from the beginning.
Sooner or later it ends with some fatal injury," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz almost a year ago.
An incredible tragedy has happened.
A young passenger from Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who had been working for two years, died on a scheduled flight from Naples.
The Slovene truck probably cornered out of the stop bar without the use of a direction indicator and stopped the bus route.
The driver of the bus suddenly tried to escape with a manoeuvring, but the right front of the bus collided with him.
The fact that two reserved places for the rest of the passengers were also sold, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses.
"These places can't be booked on long-haul flights, they're blocked."
The company wants to sue the truck driver.
By destroying the girl’s family, the agency does not wait for the court’s verdict, but also expects financial compensation from the offender.
Amendments to the law?
In the distant future
The clarification of the movement of passengers on board the bus could be a legal amendment, which has been working on for more than a year by the Ministry of Transport’s thirty-member expert group.
"The team, however, did not achieve any concrete results.
Buses are not so much, rather the punctuation system deals with the maximum permissible speed on the highway and the mobile use between driving," says Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of passengers to be anything that would fundamentally threaten the safety of passengers," said Hanselka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, who said that checking the safety of buses is the responsibility of the police and the labour services.
D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf's hopes are dashed in Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB Board of Directors to the bank’s employees is not in short supply.
The merger of D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf’s financial institutions and Frankfurt’s Deka-Bank could create “the central capital market organisation of the savings bank’s financial group” – writes the letter published Monday.
WestLB would take a permanently profitable "competence block" into such a business.
Such a relationship could give a decisive boost to further mergers in the regional banking sector.
This is the reading of when a management wants to prove its ability to act in difficult times.
The uncertainty of WestLB’s banking system continues to put a lot of pressure on WestLB.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Authority, which recently informed the North Rhine-Westphalian provincial government that it is tightening the deadline for finding a lasting solution.
However, it has been a long time since the issue of a kind of relationship between Deka-Bank and WestLB about the investment bases of the depository clients - from the part of Frankfurt.
Franz Waas, the head of Deka-Bank, announced at the end of August that the bank on Mainzer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and a regional bank, such as Helaba or the WestLB merger, had no meaning.
Despite this, the Board of Directors of the Deca, which represents one half of the provincial banks and the other half of the hedge funds associations, has entrusted the board to continue negotiations with the WestLB on joint business activities.
In this case, the capital market business or certain parts of it may be mentioned.
Negotiations, however, — financial circles say — have only just begun.
With its 3000 employees, Deka-Bank, one of the most important employers in the financial sector in Frankfurt, is not the first to emerge in connection with the consolidation of the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that Deka-Bank merged with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing has happened out of this three-party alliance.
The plans were scarcely made public, and the Hesse provincial government spoke out against Helaba's interest.
After that, the other two banks did not find each other.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was replaced by Landesbank Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of the relationship between Deka-Bank and the provincial banks has been raised over and over again.
However, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Merl, the CEO of Helaba, spoke out against the bank’s merger plans.
Regardless, there is a recognition that it is necessary to approach the various banks of the public sector.
Now, after the Bavarian provincial assembly elections, BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg are expected to be the first.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure on further mergers is increased, the potential partners may slowly disappear.
In southern Germany, he could only be a younger businessman, although the financial crisis has so far been significantly better overrun by the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The merger with WestLB was ruled out at the beginning of the year at Giroverband Hessen-Th<0xC3><0xBC>ringen, which has an 85% stake in Helaba.
On the left is the NordLB.
However, such geostrategic considerations represent only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises of how different business models of individual banks relate to each other.
Merl said in June that the German Monetary and Fat Association had not yet given an answer to the crucial question of what business model should be provided for the future of regional banks.
In the end, it is still possible to imagine a break-up of WestLB, which, however, they obviously do not want from there.
Thus, the letter from the local administration also denies that they are seeking a "full solution" anyway.
How this can be reconciled with the unification of individual units with Deka-Bank is the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "Italian weekend".
This is Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth time.
But now Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything is quite different, says Luca.
Behind them is a strong bearded man with a five-liter Kaiser-branded barrel, and it shows about 200 people travelling to the Oktoberfest how deep sounds can be heard from their throats.
Elena first touches Luca's face, then kisses her.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From there, four buses leave from the bus station near Puorta Nuova station at 23.45 for the purpose of "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival is expected at 6.30.
Three buses are mainly held by Italians, with only Brazilians travelling in the fourth.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans were already singing along with their flags, and they had already started the celebration at night.
And so loud that it's not for the Italians," says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears a long, faux fur coat and a wide, silver-colored goggles.
Five years ago, he traveled to the Oktoberfest, only three times this year.
At night, in the middle of the day on the Oktoberfest, at 22.30.
The accommodation would only be an unnecessary expense, says Marco.
The route costs 75 euros, this includes a German language course in Frankfurt, which was prepared in accordance with the Bavarian Beer Law, as well as accident insurance and German-language driving.
And the buses are already taking you into the night on the highway in the direction of "Brennero".
No beer, not yet.
The bus will be quiet soon, the passengers will sleep.
It's okay, they'll still need their strength.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, there is a rest, where on the 8th motorway, many Italian buses still take a short break in front of Munich.
When Marco’s group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past seven according to the plan, there are already nearly 50 other buses arriving from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds one last briefing, introduces the naval plan.
First of all: Everyone pick up the yellow hat.
On the left side of this can be read the inscription "Oktoberfest" written with the letters "Oktoberfest", next to the Internet address of Marco's travel office: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors of the brewery open, run," Marco shouts into the morning.
"Run!" Running and occupying places at the back of the tent.
"Not in advance, for we are to lie down, and not to sit with the same gods, all of them yellow hats, but let us spread them out in the tent."
The one-litre basket costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.25, says Marco.
And don't forget about the winery.
"Show the security guards that you've behaved well.
As you leave the places, they will be occupied!”
Third time, "I'll be back here at 11 o'clock tonight." Do you understand?
And now the Wiesn.
Along the way, as a male road sign, he attaches yellow hats to the trees, tables, and even to the election poster of one of the major Bavarian folk parties.
You have to prepare for the withdrawal.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, known as "Italian Weekend".
There are no exact numbers; 50,000 people who cross the Alps are inundated in the breweries, and ten percent of all visitors on the weekend are said to come from Italy.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tyrolean police, Italian volunteers assisting the Bajor Red Cross, which in its national statistics, with about 200 medical supplies, the Italians occupy the first place, ahead of the Austrians (about 80) and the scoundrels (about 80) and the scoundrels.
Among the Italians, the Hofbr<0xC3><0xA4>u brewery was particularly popular.
Undreamed Nights for Hypo Real Estate Lenders
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck said last week.
It is even fortunate that the politician used the word “relatively” and, to put it bluntly, that the German banking sector is not spared from crisis-like developments.
Because it happened this weekend, too.
Daxon, a Munich-based property finance company, has received a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loans will drop to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate is only required to pay interest on the part used.
The money comes partly from private and partly from public banks.
In the background are the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a press release, Depfa, who has completed state funding, loaned money to long-term projects, and refinanced it for a very short period of time – which is now impossible due to market mistrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash balance decreased by 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and its equity ratio moderately decreased from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Net income from current income and net income from financial assets has fallen to zero over the same period of the previous year, from the receipts for claims and from certain securities, as well as from the recovery of more than 70 % of the target balances of the loan.
It was only due to higher revenues from the subsequent conversion of the Depfa group, as well as the return of interest under the regulative order, and to the companies belonging to the concert, that it was able to make a profit of around 16%.
The former state-financer speculated on corporate real estate loans, which were later segregated at Aeral Bank after privatisation in 1990.
As there was little that could be done with classical state funding, Depfa was more strongly involved in infrastructure projects, as well as in private-public-partnership (PPP) projects for private investors and the state.
For the value of its subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate is now required to carry out descriptions that have a "substantial impact" on the group's performance - it has been announced quite generally.
In fact, the payment of the dividend did not take place.
The distribution has already been reduced to a third by 2007.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure financier.
Compared to other financial institutions, it is more dependent on interbank market refinancing, as it does not have a client base.
With the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the banks’ lending to each other has plummeted as the banks maintain their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds every year to refinance a portion of Depfa’s credit portfolio – some <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing demand is covered for a period of time that is visible with the loan, and the company is protected “from the influence of currently largely inoperative international money markets.”
According to other sources, thanks to the money, the refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the CEO of HRE, said that the Hypo Real Estate group does not need to use the money markets for as long as it is visible.
The German Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority (BaFin) believe that the market power of the Hypo Real Estate group is now secured.
This gives hope to the bank’s shareholders and creditors.
But because of the dynamics and incalculability of the crisis, they certainly cannot be included.
It is also impossible to imagine that funding does not have to be fully utilised.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After Saturday’s late-night news said the bank was still on the verge of bankruptcy, its temporary bailout could not calm down the favors.
The share price rate fell by 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, bond prices are quite well-liked.
While the first-place debts hardly change, the exchange rates of the subsequent bonds ordered are significantly reduced.
In particular, the crisis affects the obligations of the former subsidiary, the W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg Hypo, and in an accessible manner the longer term of the 2009 financial year.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds previously seemed to be a speculative investment alternative, their value-worthiness is now to be seen as dependent on the stability of the international financial system as a wake-up call to the banking crisis and as a result of the fact that the financial institution is taking over the debt.
As long as the ticketing banks, governments and less-hazardous commercial banks are still ready to support the system, the cancellation of flights on time can begin.
Or there is a situation in which almost no one at the moment has any hope that the financial crisis will be solved in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports relating to partial citizenship, the likelihood of a borderline with certainty is now merely a legitimate hope.
For long-term lenders, the decision to opt out of their investment can cause sleepless nights.
However, short-term investors can use the sale to provide a reserve for taxes to be paid after the exchange rate gains of the years to come.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Inner Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is due to attend Tachibana High School on her first day of school, the girls begin to tremble: The German girl is totally "Kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the manga - she talks about Japan in the new exchange blog.
"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I'm so excited.
I was already on my way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, towards Kavaszaki, and I travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I wasn't wrong.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachiban is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to snore from eight o’clock until 8:40 a.m. a short conversation begins with the teacher, the “home room”.
But before teaching started, I was in a position to introduce myself.
And I'm not the kind of guy who likes to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn’t have my school uniform yet, I picked up an old dress from my hostess, including a blouse, a blue turtleneck, and a black leather shoe.
So in this dress I stood in front of the cathedral, and I tried to say everything correctly: "Sajonara, vo se Sylvana ..." - His name is Sylvana, I came from Germany, and in a week my birthday will be.
At this point, I was very happy that I had started to learn the language two years ago.
All 31 girls were snoring, sneezing and sneezing, and I kept hearing the word "Kavai."
I've known this from my manga.
It's part of the Japanese girls' basic saying, and it means "cute, sweet."
Then I rushed to my place.
The girl sitting next to me smiled wide, and it was an honor to be seated next to the exchange.
The rest of the watch was quite calm, but when the bell sounded, they were beaten as a rule.
Everyone spoke back and laughed, and their questions made a hole in my stomach - and it's pretty hard to understand the English of the Japanese.
During the break, everyone packed their underwear.
My host also made me such a lunch - it's completely different from the boring German tens of sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, little sausages, cucumbers and alga salads, fruit and some kind of tofu beef.
Most of the time I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
The food looks strange, and they have completely new tastes.
In fact, everything is very fine.
Well, yeah, maybe except for the salt-cooked zucchini, brrrr!
In Japanese schools, the bento is not just a lunch.
It happens that a girl gives a boy a hand-crafted insole, which she composes especially artistically - in the hope that she can get to know the boy more closely at lunch break.
I read about it in my manga novels.
I'm wondering if I can watch this here.
“Why in Japan?” my girlfriends asked when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I've always said,
"Because he's just charming."
After all, I've been reading the best manga for years.
And to get a better understanding of the comic books and the culture they describe, I once began to learn Japanese.
It was very clear to me that I would have to travel here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And they're here with great respect.
Japan, on the one hand, is a country of the latest techniques and trends - on the other hand, strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything was so well organized, I never felt lost, even though Tokyo was the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have feelings.
He's running away in the event of a rat or a mole. Does that mean he's scared?
Joseph LeDoux, a neuroscientist, is convinced that animals also have emotions.
But how can we examine whether they feel the same way when they behave in a similar way to us?
In the online journal "Edge", famous scientists have published their articles for years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in one of its series, "What do you think is real without being able to prove it?", echoes from the answers to the question.
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far. It is true that we cannot even prove that we have consciousness of other people.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of every human brain is the same.
However, as we examine other species, and confuse the issues of perception or consciousness in general, we come to a hard-to-reach field because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it makes itself dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some researchers conclude that they have comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to transfer our own subjective experiences to animals.
On the one hand, human consciousness-related circuits almost always contain the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and in executive/management functions).
This wide area is more advanced in humans than in other primates, and it seems to be completely lacking in other living things.
At least in the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as the consciousness of who we are, or in the case of planning and decision-making ability, it is reasonable to assume that man is different from the rest of the protagonists.
Another dramatic feature lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since a significant part of human experience is related to language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
However, even if consciousness does not depend on language, language would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever it may be, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness can be like for other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and because of special hardware it cannot be analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then our research poses serious problems.
Most of my chapters relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is probably easier to approach to science.
It would be possible to examine the conscious processes of animals without regard to their content, and this is exactly what happens in the case of experiments on the short-term memory of the main mammals, especially in the example of visualization.
However, in this assumption examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely more on the neural connections of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be the same or not.
Interestingly, this assumption also emphasizes the importance of prefrontal cortex in the creation of visualization.
What follows from this sentiments?
This leads me back to the fact that an emotional system, like its fear, is activated in the brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we call “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we are when the activity (or consequences) of the defense system located in the brain includes a working memory.
Thus, when examined, emotions are closely related to the areas of the cerebral cortex that are characteristic of the main organs and especially of the human being.
In addition to the linguistic character, perception is characterized by subtle degrees, because with the help of words and language, we are able to distinguish and categorize situations so that we can describe them to others on our own.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that emotions come from the simpler activities of the brain cortex and the brainstem’s areas of perception, as does Jaak Pankseep, who, however, prefers to focus on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it can easily play a role in the overall emotions of the species.
Well, I can't say that in theory, but I think it's unprovable.
Pankseep believes that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to be felt in both cases: How can we control whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
Does a rat run away in case of danger, does he also feel fear?
In my opinion, only such behavior has not yet been evidence of the same experience.
Although the neural comparison will help further: rats and humans have a similar brain strain, but rats do not have brains.
But the brainstem is responsible for the emotions?
And even if this can be proven for humans, how can we prove it for rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but maybe even rodents (who knows?) have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And since their emotions are suspiciously fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I’m researching the emotional behavior of rats rather than the emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
As with rats, I don’t research language and consciousness, nor do I research emotions, because I don’t know if they exist.
This may seem like a short-sighted approach to others, but I’m moving forward rather than constantly hitting the wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of UEFA: The time of mercy for Poland and Ukraine
The Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Ivan Vaszjunik said that the preparations will shortly be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the confidence and testimony in the decision of UEFA Bordeaux in Ukraine that it believes that Ukraine is capable of organising the European Championship together with Poland," said Vaszjunik.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there’s still a lot to do in both countries.”
As for the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both host countries are in a state of disrepair.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums will be reduced by six to eight.
“We can’t waste more time.
We need to work at a high speed now," said Grigory Surkiss, president of the Ukrainian Football Association.
"Uefa will keep an eye on us all the time."
In Poland, they wanted to take an even more radical step.
The National Olympic Committee has suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN, which was replaced by independent supervisor Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met on the initiative of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
“There is a serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to function according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP news agency.
"We have assured Michel Platini, the president of UEFA, that this will not adversely affect the preparations for the 2012 European Cup."
It was only in the last season that several first league teams had to be placed in the lower class due to manipulation, and eventually the league start had to be postponed.
The Angry Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
The actress would have liked to promote a new film, in the interview she talked about her privacy - and now she got into trouble with her ex-husband. And Ryan considered her ex-husband, Dennis Quaid, a Hollywood star, to be a marriage breaker.
The one who sneezes - and cuts back
The War of the Late Roses at Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid's ex-husband: The two Hollywood actors have been fighting each other for seven years after their divorce - before the public.
In an interview with InStyle last week, Ryan said of the reasons for the divorce: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, causing a lot of pain.”
It wasn't until after the divorce that he found out how many women Dennis cheated on.
The spiritual striptease was made because of Ryan's new press work on the film "Women", which tells the story of a marriage breakup.
Dennis Quaid responded to the call of an unfaithful husband: “It’s terrible,” the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News newspaper, “that Meg unwittingly repeats and relives the story of our relationship.”
In addition, it is also "sad" that 16-year-old boys, Jack, are again "publicly reminded of the many pains and changes that divorce causes to a child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid remarried and recently became the father of a couple.
Therefore, the answer ends with the following side cut: "My life is still going on anyway.
I am happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is in the best order.”
Prices of air tickets and hotel rooms are going down.
In the first half of 2008, European flights and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, in Germany, airplanes have become no less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of flights and hotel rooms have again become cheaper - so you can sum up the results of one of the studies of the American Express travel and financial services provider.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and, following the first quarter price increase, established a significant price increase in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices in the hotel market, hotels have become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices rose by an average of 6.9 per cent in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed compared to 2007.
However, in the period from April to June, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is that the American Express sees the dollar at a low rate, which has led “to the lazy travel of American tourists.”
The decrease in hotel room prices is more likely to affect financial centers such as Frankfurt or London, such as industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
The increase in hotel prices in the Norwegian city is a European record of 26.3 per cent.
In the first quarter, there was also an increase in the price of airline tickets.
Due to the price of kerosene, passengers in the tourist class had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, while long-haul flights with high fuel requirements were priced at 29.2 per cent.
Between April and June, the prices of tourist-class flights decreased by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first-class prices only showed a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices have fallen even higher than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9 percent and fell by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
The price of domestic flights in Germany, according to the study, fell by half.
The reason for the price drop is, on the one hand, the growing economic growth, the company says.
In many segments of the airline market, demand has weakened.
On the other hand, as a result of the Open Skies agreement liberalising air travel between the US and Europe, the pressure exerted by the competition situation is intensifying.
The tense situation is evidenced by the fact that airlines are erasing their lossy flights and many airlines reported a failure in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe this affects 24 airlines.
HSV 1-0 beat Gladbachot
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV came to the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning team.
Kristoffer Klein Enlargement Deep flight for national-selected Marko Marin.
The gladbachi player was only late in the game, and his lifting bounced back from the gate.
His exact message left his lips unconvincingly.
He just knew he was right.
“We have a rush to the second goal,” said Hermann Rieger at the Hamburg Arena’s booth corridor.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break was over, and most of them were sitting in their place again.
Rieger was HSV’s physiotherapist for nearly three decades, gaining greater recognition than some of the players who played for him.
So your request for a hearing was found in the appropriate place.
Cornelius Jol, an assistant, was healed, and he showed his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of the Hamburg leader, Martin Jol.
His command might have been like this: Here with the second goal!
The execution of the order is missing.
“Today was not always a beautiful sight,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt also "slowly imagined" the thing.
The 1:0 (1:0) goal result is thanks to the Mladen Petric head of the Hamburgers (11th); and the fact that the very weak gladbachians could not cause pain to the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a terrible victory," Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on Monday.
The spectators have already celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the table on the podium, which has shown the teams as a classmate of the championship.
It will be a birthday without a party.
“We know where to put it,” said Marcell Jansen.
It is understood that the evidence between the tables indicates the incalculability of the league rather than the dominance of the HSV.
Although the team is slowly finding itself, thanks to its late-committed achievements - Brazil's Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric and FC Bayern's Jansen - but it is not yet shining.
"We need more sense and more action," Jol said.
After the Decline
Wall Street is filled with fear.
As a result of the first news of the rescue package's failure, the Dow Jones temporarily dropped 700 points.
This was the biggest loss in a single day’s history.
Later, the Dow got a little stronger.
At 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer was down 5 percent and stood at 10,579 points.
The Nasdaq, which trades in technological papers, fell by more than seven percent to 1548 points.
Dow’s biggest loss at the moment was American Express with a 14% loss, followed by Bank of America with 12%.
Not a single piece of paper has grown stronger.
Goldman Sachs’s shares fell by nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, Warren Buffett bought a stake in the bank.
Within the framework of the rescue action, resources are planned to be made available for the purchase of two so-called identification papers.
However, they do not want to pay the amount at once, but gradually.
In exchange, the state would receive the equity options of the financial institutions, which would be redeemable in the event of the proper development of the exchange rates, reducing the burden on the treasury.
European, U.S. and U.S. stock exchange rates
Billions of aid to European and American banks do not divulge the doubts of investors.
Hypo Real Estate’s German stock price is falling and it’s catching up with Dax.
The Dow Jones indicator is declining despite the money market state’s planned savings.
The visible exchange losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have thrown the German stock exchange (Dax) at a low level.
Despite the federal government and private banks’ bailout, the value of Munich’s real estate funder’s stake has fallen to a quarter, with Commerzbank weakening by more than 20 percent.
The Dax sank below the spiritually important 6,000-point limit and recorded a 3.7-percent decrease of 5839 points.
Stock markets have been forced to go around the world.
In New York, Wall Street opened with a significant loss.
Investors believe that the U.S. government’s $700 billion bailout package will not be enough to spur the money markets.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trading, down 3.3 percent to 10,809.25.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, and the Senate vote could take place on October 1.
The rest of the European stock markets are only in one direction: in London, the FTSE index showed a 3.2% decline, while in Paris, CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei index fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points after the initial increase.

At the commercial and tourist concert, he also announced that Thomas Cook shares are not sold.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused a lack of advice among researchers. The dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts believe that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity cannot be fully correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft has been flying in space for nearly 18 years.
Due to the soon-to-be-frozen fuel lines, the freeze is threatening death.
Among scientists, for years, confusion has caused a mysterious phenomenon, the swing-by anomaly.
The swing-by is the gravitational wave of space probes, during which an additional impulse is generated by a celestial body, for example, in the Earth's gravitational field.
Thus, the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe also used this physical trick, similar to the Ulysses sun probe.
What has been encouraging researchers for years, however, is that flying objects do not behave to the full extent that would be expected under the ancient law of gravity.
Instead, irregularities occur at the speed.
The probes suddenly accelerate or slow down.
The scientists have not yet found an explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon has been dubbed a swing-by anomaly.
Some experts believe that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be completely correct, which assumes the mass attraction of matter as the curvature of space.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Princetoni Institute for Advanced Study, continues to shy away from believing that Einstein was right, and the swing-by anomaly is trying to explain the so-called dark matter discovered by spaceships in the universe.
“The dark matter may be responsible for the anomaly, which may even be found near the Earth,” Adler wrote.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space explorers for ten years.
Obviously, it exerts a gravitational force that can be observed to have an effect on other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, i.e. no electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light does not emit or bounce back.
According to scientists, a good fifth of the total mass of the universe consists of dark matter.
Execution of tourists kidnapped in Egypt
After spending ten days in the captivity of their captives, tourists stranded in Egypt are again free, the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The Saudis have demanded millions of euros in ransoms.
In the shooting before the release of the hostages, six hostages allegedly lost their lives.
Five German nationals have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the exchange rate are already underway.
Over and over again, Germany becomes the target of human traffickers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists stranded in the Sahara are free.
This was reported in conjunction with the Egyptian state television, the Al-Arabiya Arab TV broadcaster and the Italian media.
According to the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of the release: "Our compatriots and the other hostages have been released.
We are currently examining their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian citizen, as well as eight Egyptian escorts, are safe and sound, the Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are said to be on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the shooting before the release of the hostages are further obscure: According to an Egyptian security official, the hostage-takers have already shown a willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army kills them by surprise.
“The problem has been solved.
They accepted the ransom,” the official said.
"But it was only a matter of taking hostages," when suddenly "the surprise" happened.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers shot six people in the border areas between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The hostages demanded a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million ransom from Germany; the money was to be handed over to one of the hostage's German wives.
The newspaper al-Masri al-Jom, referring to a German media outlet, reported that the release of hostages is being withdrawn because human traffickers are concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, hostage-takers are free to release female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men are held captive by the kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo was not willing to take up a position in connection with the report.
"Suicide Leads to" the violence in Mostohap<0xC3><0xA1>
The court heard that a woman had committed suicide because her stepfather had been raping her for years.
Michael Trerise, a 57-year-old man who lives in Stithians, Cornwall County, has been in prison for six years after testifying to the attempted rape of eight-times.
The Truro Criminal Court found that she had regularly tied her stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, between the age of five and seven.
In one of Trerise's testimony, he wrote, "I feel guilty for his death."
At the trial, Randle, 34, was found guilty of suicide at his home in the city of Plymouth, Mutley, on April 1, 2007.
While living in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied and tied her eyes to the meetings while her mother worked in a bar.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and re-elected Cornwall as his residence.
His brother-in-law moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it turned out that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust’s memorial service, was haunted by the horrors of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, attorney Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who had previously passionately loved surfing and cycling, said her friends were "emotionally dead" and "disappeared from life".
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, was found dead in his Plymouth apartment.
He probably stabbed himself with a handkerchief.
Mr. Randle came into contact with his daughter's stepfather, who ended his confession in a letter: "I always tied up and tied up his eyes.
I didn't sexually harass you.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're a very strange fetishist, and I'm sure that was terrible for your victim, especially if you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant family affair ended in the fact that the victim became a suicide.
Even more thoughtful, however, is the fact that if he did not do so, perhaps the case would never have been brought before the court.”
The judge added: "I would like to draw your attention to the impact Stephanie's parents have had on her daughter over the years of the crime you committed.
If that didn’t happen, she would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman.”
The officer responsible for the loss of important data has been charged.
According to BBC reports, the government has been accused of violating official secrecy by a government official who had left secret documents on a train in June.
The man was on an expert assignment from the Department of Homeland Security when he left two strictly secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the slightest accusation of a violation of the law, and there is no suspicion of intentional conduct.
Frank Gardner, a whistleblower assigned to the BBC's Department of Homeland Security, said the move surprised many in Whitehall.
“They believed that the Department of Homeland Security and the government would treat the case as an internal matter,” he said.
An employee who cannot be appointed has been charged on the basis of paragraph 8.1 of the law. This paragraph is about the retention of information.
The State Prosecution has recommended that the Metropolitan Police represent the man on the charges brought against him because of his work of a rather sensitive nature with regard to the United Committee on Notifications.
The documents he lost included covert investigations into the capabilities of Al-Qaeda and the Iraqi military.
On Monday, they were informed of the decision, and then moved from their home to an unknown location.
Homebuilders pay B&amp;B’s bill
The UK’s housing unions are expected to account for more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million after Bradford’s Bingley bank bailout.
The government has spent <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the assets of 2.6 million account holders at Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all the companies that use the money of the depositors, including 59 housing associations.
Adrian Coles, president of the Association of Building Alliances (BSA), said it was "disgraceful" that companies and members had to pay.
The 14 billion-dollar loan will eventually be repaid after the repayment of Bradford's Bingley tokens.
However, the interest accrued in the meantime is accrued annually to the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing associations are among them as well.
Regrettably, the institutions that have so far been circumspect... now have to pay the bills of those institutions that have been much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that every company has to pay in the proportion of the deposit amount in its possession. The companies share 18% of the costs among each other.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the loan amount will reach <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies have to miss out on <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay interest on the first year.
Adrian Coles, the director-general of the trade union of housing companies, told the BBC that he considers the measure unfair.
“It’s encouraging that those institutions need to pay the bills of the much less cautious institutions, which were cautiously committed at the time of the housing market’s upswing.”
According to the BSA, no company has been destroyed since it began operating in 1945.
“In all respects, we need to look at this issue in the next few weeks to decide how we can protect the housing companies and their members from a significant amount of bills,” Cole said.
The interest rate due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, you will have to pay a full year’s interest, which can even be twice that of the current one.
Since the housing unions are self-help organizations, without shareholders, the members will eventually have to pay the bill, either on higher fees, or through lower interest rates received after their deposits.
The price of milk rises by five pennies per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The dairy company in Jersey has announced that it will raise the price of milk by an additional five pennies per litre from Monday.
This is the second price hike since the two penny hikes in February and after an investigation by a consulting company.
It is up to the retailers themselves to decide whether to extend the price increase to consumers.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey’s milk changed for the last time in 2002.
Bangladesh's former MP's request to be able to defend him freely has been rejected.
The Bangladeshi court has rejected a request for protection from former MP Sheikh Hasina, which means that he can be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyer said the court had denied him the defence of his release in connection with the allegation that 50 million takas ($729,700) were stolen from a businessman during his parliamentary representation.
This is just one of the many corruption charges brought against him.
Sheikh Hasina’s former political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released from custody this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but his party, the Awami League, demands that the country’s military-backed interim government give him full freedom first.
According to the reports, although they were placed on probation to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear from the conditions of placement of free feet that he can keep his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeals.
"The court of appeal has ordered Sheikh Hasina's request for custody that he is not needed because he has been placed on temporary leave and is taking part in foreign medical treatment," Rafique-ul Huq's lawyer said in a statement.
"We're going to appeal against the decision of the court of appeal."
According to his lawyer’s arguments, he needs to defend himself on the loose in order to return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
A leader of the Awami League party said Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
Last year, they were detained after the army-backed provisional government took over power, but in June they were released from prison to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges brought against them.
Concerns over Afghanistan's polio protection programme
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 Afghan children have been left out of the recently organized polio protection program due to Taliban-related violence.
Last week, the United Nations launched a defense action in six provinces.
However, they said they were unable to reach children living in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, all of this happened despite the Taliban’s promise that they will not attack or impede the work of thousands of staff who are carrying out the vaccination.
BSkyB's appeal against ITV has been rejected
They rejected BskyB’s appeal against the Competition Commission’s decision, which prompted it to reduce its interest in the rival TV broadcaster, ITV.
The Competition Court has ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
Earlier, the Commission found that BSkyB’s shareholding impedes competition and leads the company to unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought its stake in 2006 and effectively prevented NTL - which has since been renamed Virgin Media - from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the share purchased by BSkyB from ITV jeopardised the independence of ITV, encouraging the Competition Law Commission to initiate an investigation.
Virgin's director, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's oversight all opposed the acquisition.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in ITV's shareholding was a disproportionate and unreasonable endorsement - particularly given that BSkyB stated that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
Re-examining the case of U.S. Attorneys
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to examine the conduct of the nine U.S. Attorneys General in 2006.
The move followed the fact that the report on the case, prepared by the Chief Superintendent of the Court of Justice, criticised the decisions of government officials.
The report condemned the White House officials, lawmakers, and the former prime minister, Alberto Gonzalez.
The investigation was ordered because he was afraid that the state attorneys were being run out of political consideration.
Nora Dannehy, a special counsel, is now going to investigate whether the officers who were interviewed during the investigation have tried to stop the justice system by lying.
"The serious charges of possible crimes have not yet been investigated and have not been clarified," said Glenn Fine, the chief inspector general.
One of the main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor, who has the power to oblige witnesses to testify.
The series began with the removal of nine U.S. prosecutors from the U.S. Justice Department's December 2006 filing.
At the time, they were told that the state attorneys were fired because of their poor performance.
However, it turned out later that the runaway state attorneys were not given a worse rating than many of their other colleagues, which led many to the conclusion that political reflection was drawn behind the dismissals.
Some state attorneys participated in the criminal proceedings of high-ranking Republican congressional members, while others were unwilling to participate in the investigation of charges of electoral fraud brought against Democrats.
U.S. Attorneys are investigating the government's order and carrying out court cases.
They can run at any time, but for political reasons they cannot be removed from their position.
At that time, Alberto Gonzales, the head of the judiciary, became the target of the attacks because of the raids and eventually resigned.
A number of other officials of the court also filed their resignations.
Gonzales, in his report to the Chief Superintendent, strongly condemned Gonzales' role in the case. He believes that the prime public prosecutor has "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, his "rejected" leadership role, and his "extremely out of hand".
Other officials, including Karl Rove, a former aide to Bush, have said they have not been able to cooperate in the investigation.
Meat Loaf Eposza Receives Acknowledgement
The rock star Meat Loaf will receive recognition for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell" at the Q Awards awards gala.
The singer, who will be taking over next week’s special gold-grade award at the London festival, said it was an honor.
The song was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 album, Nine Minutes, Fifty Seconds long.
Coldplay has received the most nominations for this year’s awards, and has been nominated in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are a few songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres, and ‘Bat Out Of Hell’ like that.”
The song obtained by Jim Steinman required a very large sound, and this sound was Meat Loafé.
The song started with an almost two-minute soundtrack.
It was released as a single in 1979 and peaked at number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" was on the charts for almost nine years and has since sold over 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has recently been struggling with health problems. Among other things, in 2003 he underwent surgery due to a heart rhythm disorder after collapsing on the stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel a few concerts due to a thunderstorm.
It was later discovered that there was a cyst on the vocal cord.
Unknown city street, which is often forgotten and may soon be sold.
New York City has thousands of radios, circuits, and other side streets, some of which are famous, some of which feature purely practical functions.
However, many practicing taxi drivers and locals who have lived here for a long time could hardly tell where the Extra Place is, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The small street is in East Village and runs north from First Street - without reaching Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It is about 9 m wide and 36 m long, and is much more like a porous sewer than a main transport route.
There are no street signs.
It is not possible to find it on a standard map.
However, the street has its wonders.
There is, for example, Avalon Bay, the builder of the recently built First Street Luxury Villages.
You want to wrap up Extra Place again, and you want to ensure that you can get to the shops and shops of the new buildings in a cleaner way.
Among the wonders of the street are the neighbors who have long lived here, who were caught in the street of the brick, that this was the only remnant of the area's pre-renovation past.
However, it is not in the interest of the owner of the street, the city’s building-preservation and development department to insist on it.
This month, at a meeting of the district council's territorial management committee, the city and representatives of Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the committee would prefer the street to remain in the city’s management and asked for a new plan for next month, said Susan Stetzer, district head of the 3rd municipal body.
"There are very few areas in the city already in possession and we would like to see Extra Place continue to remain in the city," he said.
"There may be proposals to renew and manage the Avalon, but we also want to ensure that it remains accessible to the public."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it would like to cover the small street again and provide seating. Some of these would be used by a cafe, for which the builder is expected to rent an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it did not adhere to its ownership.
"The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to renovate this destroyed sicator and turn it into a pleasant public haven," he said, adding that the city recommended buying it.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Office of Building Preservation, said the city really wanted to sell the street, and noted that the office’s job was to develop the buildings and not to manage them.
Compared to its more colorful neighborhood, the Extra Place has little historical significance compared to Bowery.
In 1802, Philip Minthorne was given the name "No Man's Land", when he was given a large estate among his numerous children, and no one was in need of a narrow tract of land.
The 2006 punk-rock memorial, the CBGB's back door, opened to Extra Place, and the street is perhaps the most famous of all the photos taken there on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia."
“It was a great location,” said Danny Fields, manager of Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, of clothes, of garb and post pieces, and of sheets and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about how they took possession of the middle-class East Village, oppose the sale of the Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, however modest, must remain in the possession of the community.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rarity, which is a virtually unchanged piece of the city and which must be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, the author of the blog “Jeremiah’s Disappearing New York” (“The Book of Siralms: A Cruel Nostalgia Considering the Extinction of the City”) has submitted a part of the story about the “Extra Place” in the title “The New Yorker” in the book “The Crucible” in the title “The New Yorker of the Year.”
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "The Extra Place is a narrow, small bag that is dark even during the day, bordered by rusty, iron-clad storage and flushing windows, and where it carries unambiguous newspapers in the wind in the canals."
The street, with a few exceptions, looked the same as it did a few nights ago.
A rat ran through the end of the street, next to the back door, which used to lead into the CBGB and now belongs to a higher-priced clothing store built in place.
The walls were graffiti and an empty, 0.75-litre beer bottle lay next to a discarded, fresh newspaper pulpit.
Some walkers have said that Extra Place rarely comes to mind, but they think it would cover the renovation.
Fields said he believed some underestimated the appeal of the street in its current state.
“I’ve spent the most beautiful years of my life in dark, gloomy and tasteless places,” he said.
Debate on bilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English-speaking environment
The Education Observer in this section discusses the views of Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an experienced researcher at the Pacific Institute of Policy Research in California and the director of education research, is quoted as saying, “Not as good as you think: Why does the middle class need a chance to choose a middle class?”
It is not easy to favor voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama’s proposals for education are also included here.
According to Obama’s campaign, “African-American and Spanish-speaking students are significantly less likely to get a degree than white students,” and that’s true.
In order to combat such performance differences, Obama's educational plan explicitly supports - among other things - "transitional bilingual education" for English learners.
At the same time, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which places emphasis on non-English-language school education, is over-emphasized in his interest in tackling major performance differences.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep Contractual General School in the eastern part of Los Angeles County.
Most of the school’s students are Spanish-speaking and low-income.
More than a third of students – many of whom have recently arrived – are learning English.
Despite this, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results in the 2008 State Mathematical Review.
Similarly, it is impressive that 93% of fourth graders performed excellently on the English language and literature exam.
This incredible performance has not been achieved with the tool that Obama will be taking advantage of.
Sixth Street places the emphasis on repetition, practice, on the continuous assessment of skills, and on the rejection of excuses.
In addition, and this is what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikels, the director of Sixth Street, the school’s educational principle is the “full immersion” of English learners into the language environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of the English language in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said: “We had a tremendous success in getting into a classroom, not realizing who the student was who just arrived from Mexico 12 months ago.”
"It works," he said, "it works for us."
Would Obama set as an example the other schools with a significant number of Spanish-speaking and English-speaking students as a teaching ground for such schools as the Sixth Street Prep?
The results achieved by the school should be clear to make the answer, but due to the education policy of its own party (the National Educational Associations have long supported bilingual education), and since it is itself consistent with Obama’s bilingual education, we can’t afford to.
Although he agreed that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently expressed disapprovingly about the issue when he said that people should not worry so much about the law because of "extremely English speaking."
Instead, he said, "they should get their children to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to achieve a reduction in the differences between the results, he should seriously study the models that work instead of looking down and taking them to nothing.
Due to renewed concerns about the economy, the price of oil has fallen sharply
On Monday, oil spills have come to a standstill due to concerns that the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets will not be able to revive the economy.
Earnings oil securities returned 7 percent to $99.80 in the morning at New York’s Trade Fair.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, the stock market has been fuelled by financial turmoil on Wall Street and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices reached $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell back to nearly $90 per barrel earlier this month, before again falling under the influence of the insurmountable uncertainty of financial markets.
On Monday, the concern brought investors back into power even after the leaders of the congress announced that they had managed to agree on the economic bailout on the weekend, which is the largest ever in history.
The news has been shadowed by concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for long.
In the latest event of the unfolding crisis, Citigroup will acquire the Wachovia Corporation’s banking business, the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital analysts, as a result of the desperate weekend deals, "it seems that the rescue operation failed to revive the stock market's trade advantage."
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that demand for goods - such as oil - will also decrease.
“The future of the stock market, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain around the world,” wrote an analyst at Deutsche Bank.
"We believe that the market for goods will not escape the 'disaster'.
From the point of view of the commodity market, the biggest question is to what extent the “disease” of the United States infects the entire world, especially with regard to China.
As oil consumption has declined due to a slowdown in economic growth, analysts have cut their expectations for the coming year by 20%, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas tankers by 2009.
With the second quarter's Bravery, the team set a record
After spending more time in the Jets over the past eight seasons than anyone else, Shaun Ellis, who has played in the defensive end position, thought he had seen it all.
But then he watched the opening of the second quarter on Sunday, when the Jets turned a game without a point into a sensational game.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the game of the Jets and Arizona Cardinals was fully aligned with the towering, dark clouds in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback gave 12-yard touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles. This became the perfect precursor to an afternoon in which their outstanding collaboration improved significantly.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdown passes in this quarter, including two cornerbacks that fell 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't regret the fatigue," Favre said of all Coles' passes.
“He’s such a good player.
So far, we’ve been able to communicate well with each other, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were bowling, the defense stopped Cardinals manager Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, who played in the cornerback position, caught a bad throw and threw back 32 yards, which earned him a touchdown.
Eric Smith, a safety player, reached into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, a linebacker, managed to kick the ball out of Warner's hands.
This last round could have been the most impressive move in the game.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end and the Jets got it, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field goal, setting the score to 34:0.
That was the best result the Jets have achieved so far in a quarter.
When asked by Jets coach Eric Mangin to characterize the game's striking character, he said, "The second or third quarter?"
When told that both of them – in the third quarter the Cardinals scored 21 points so the Jets didn’t score one – Mangini said: “I have to say that I enjoyed the second quarter much better than the third.
We got a lot of points in a short period of time.”
Gebrselassie to break her own world record
Ethiopia’s Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many consider themselves to be the best middle- and long-distance runner ever, when he broke his own world record in Berlin on Sunday, becoming the first to run the 42.2 kilometres in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds on the comfortably flat track with a win in the time of 2:03:59 with a previous score of 2:04:26, which he reached last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie set his 26th world record for his career in such a variety of fields that he won a world championship almost every season from 1500 metres to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympics marathon, which, in view of this, may have proved too cautious, to continue to exacerbate asthmatic problems.
He was nominated for the Berlin Marathon.
In almost perfect conditions - in daylight, starting at 9 <0xC2><0xB0>C and ending at 13 <0xC2><0xB0>C - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, incredible, with a speed of 2 minutes 56 seconds per kilometer.
Since previous non-starters such as Gebrselassie and Kenyan Paul Tergat turned to longer distances, the marathon record has dropped by more than two minutes in the last decade since Brazil’s Ronaldo da Costa in Berlin in 1998 at 2:06:05.
After Sunday's win, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he was delighted with the two leg cramps and could not exercise for two weeks.
It's obvious that she's refreshed under the pressure cooker, and she's not snoring.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything has been perfectly developed.
A week ago I started exercising again and today I had my doubts, but in the end everything was fine."
He got some criticism - especially from Kenya, from Ethiopia's East African rivalry - that he used too many assists during his races, usually avoiding many world-famous marathons, leaving his archers as if he were running on the track, and setting world records for this race.
However, this criticism hardly diminishes the magnificence of Gebrselassie in the long run.
Gebrselassie scored the semi-finals with four Kenyan runners at 1:02:04 on Sunday.
Two top-line Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the racers got tired.
Not much more than 4.8 kilometres before the goal, Gebrselassie left Kwambai with a last sprint, reaching the second goal with 2:05:36, improving 5 minutes to his individual best.
Kamathi came in third in 2:07:48.
In the women's competition, Kazakhstan-born Irina Mikitenko, who is now a German citizen, closed a noteworthy year with the seventh fastest, 2:19:19 victory.
Paula Radcliffe holds the World Cup with a time of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London Marathon with a score of 2:24:14.
Due to his alleged back injury at the Beijing Olympics, he was unable to participate, but quickly recovered and won the Berlin Marathon, where he improved by five minutes at the individual summit. This was the third marathon away run in which he participated.
He won the race with a clever calculation: he first allowed a group of four Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and make a significant lead, and then after about 30 km he came after them.
Ethiopia's Askale Tafa Magarsa scored a second time with 2:21.31, while Kenya's Helena Kiprop came third with a score of 2:25:01.
A Distinguished City, the Pride and Tribute of Black
In the expansive amusement park in Greater Orlando – a few miles away from everything that stars, loud and huge – a quiet small town where the pride and complexities of African American life were born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city to be integrated into the country, and which was the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, today is not as simple as it was described in 1935: "the five lakes, three croquettes, 300 brown skin, 300 good swimmers, and a lot of turtles."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have already attended the annual Zora Festival, which is held in Eatonville in honor of the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance, Hurston.
Yet, in many ways, the city he described and made into a tourist attraction - which is also included in the Florida Guidebook published by the Project of the Federal Writers of the War Era - apart from its surroundings.
It was as independent, dignified and captivating as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that, according to a Florida, urban blacks were often unwilling to share their true thoughts with white people who “know so little about us” that they don’t know what to expect.
Even in the year when the black president-elect, Barack Obama is calling for an open exchange of views on the issue of race, here many are distrustful of the views of outsiders.
“We care a lot about how they tell our story,” said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here his entire life and is a member of the city’s oldest church.
"You have to say it right."
Eatonville has long been characterized by the paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, it is a model of historical significance for the black population, while at the same time it is a community of nearly 2,400 people, where poverty indicators reach double the national average.
Partly a literary cluster, and partly an example of the American enslavement that has been created, sometimes overlooked, sometimes for the glory of a southern, urban, black culture that flourishes in the shade of oak trees.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the inhabitants of this place are both proud and protective.
The image of Eatonville is important since Zora (everyone here calls it Hurston).
In his honest, strong dialectic books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937), he introduced his hometown to the world.
The five paragraphs of the Florida Guide have transformed the city, which lies next to Route 17. This route leads from the long-forgotten center of Florida to one of the sites of black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was both brave in life and literature, even in the fall, introduced his readers to Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke's business, and then looked into the more confidential spheres.
“From the road to the right, we’ll find the modern public school, with a brown-based white edge, carefully maintained courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller cares about, although he can barely write and read.”
He made mention of his widow Dash's new husband, and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and anything that may be needed at the temporary accommodations."
Thus, in a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with autonomy, but at the same time with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
It is clear that Fodor's Guidebook was presented differently.
This description was not liked by everyone.
“Sora told me things the way they were,” said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson’s daughters, who made them immortal by quoting from the glitzy songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as the 11-year-old in particular, who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston stormed into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a noisy Chevrolet, cigarette-smoking, and long-sleeved city where people are still proud of their dignified dressing.
Most people were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were fascinated.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Franklin said.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added, leaning in his chair, "Never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were not reissued.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with most of the world, had forgotten about it.
Although he was once a popular writer, Langston Hughes' contemporary, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, was buried in a unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he previously lived.
At Eatonville, there were no significant memorabilia or large, public readings.
“I don’t think they understood how much he enriched the world, or what he left us with,” said Valerie Boyd, author of the 2003 Hurston biography, “Covered in the Desert.”
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-lane road through the city instead of the two-lane main street, Kennedy Street, which played an important role in the community's life.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated the city’s western border with the Interstate 4 motorway connecting the states.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still on his feet after a difficult historical period.
Among other things, forced integration brought an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggles of mixed race became a source of hatred for the community.
"A team of white boys came through the time and threw seats on the side of the road with oranges and other things," Franklin said.
"There was a woman who died in this.
They got a Greek woman out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's decision to impose violent integration, stating that he "would rather not violate the decision of the Brown v. Board of Education."
Today, residents say that the dissegregation of schools was positive in some respects, weakened the adherence of the Eatonvilles, and undermined the young people’s self-confidence.
"Black children are used to killing them - I remember this - the man dressed his teacher in the morning and evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, a nonprofit organization called "Keep the Eatonville Community."
"This lasted as long as the students and teachers came from a common place," he added.
“We didn’t dress up our white teacher because he was a white teacher – I mean there were cultural differences between us,” Nathiri said.
However, human rights have helped many other Zora Neale Hurston’s rise – in black writers, actors, and artists who have risen above prejudices, as he has done, with a sense of self-confidence and lines like the following: “How can I live by my own strength?
It's unfathomable to me."
In 1975, Alice Walker ransacked Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to restore his reputation.
Five years later, the bookstores were put on the shelves of an acclaimed biography of Hurston, written by Robert E. Hemenway, which re-emerged among American examples.
The construction project would have started just when Eatonville’s most famous daughter once again became the center of attention.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw him as a savior.
In 1988, the community started organizing a Hurston festival to show what would ruin the county by the main route.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and since then many have been returning to the festival every January.
A few years later, the county stood by the road construction proposal.
“Because of the five-lane road closure, the community is reviving, connected to full speed, which means real civic pride,” Nathiri said.
Boyd simply said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped to change the image of the city itself.
An increasing number of people living outside the city, such as lawyer Rachelle Munson, who began attending church in 1993, and locals began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the National Historic List in 1998.
In 2006, a new, one-storey library (of course named Hurston) opened on the redecorated Kennedy Street.
Eatonville is still a Florida cuckoo: it’s not just ten miles from downtown Orlando, but sometimes it feels like an outdoor sidewalk in the summertime; it’s as small as when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(My population is 90% black.)
They're still being treated with caution by outsiders who come here looking for Eatonville's story to tell.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things - such as Eatonville's oldest fresco, painted by a white man and depicting black people working on the ground - should not be photographed.
In Eatonville, many — including self-confident Jones, who is particularly attracted to the bright red — fear that they may misunderstand their distinctive community.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival became more and more widespread, the pride of the hometown grew as well.
In particular, young people are increasingly looking at Eatonville as Hurston saw his own species: they are amazing, with their problems and with everything, they are neither better nor worse, as proud, as creative, caring, as crazy and confused as they are, and more confused than wood.
Honest civil attachment is silenced by the words of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to work at the local government or the police, who says he is struggling to find work.
And it seems that even the younger ones have learned to properly characterize Eatonville, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
“Most of those who just pass here think that this city is nothing compared to the rest of the city,” said Alondra Kenon recently after the worship on a Sunday.
"But if someone stops and takes a little time to get to know their history, then this is a very nice city."
We all speak the language of finance here in New York.
Nothing has changed on the surface.
If tourists didn’t care about the newsroom’s vaults and the huge TV receivers in Times Square, I wouldn’t notice that they’re in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with glass-walled, beehive-shaped offices over their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who hold New York in power have been living the most difficult days since 1929.
The runners are still swirling through their metal tea carts on the sidewalks, transporting muffin-caught dishes for breakfast meetings.
Men with Spanish lips still crumpled between the clumps, squeezing as a human fist with a fifty-five rivets of ingots, which hang on their shoulders, similar to their tails.
Office workers are still standing in line for their morning sweet pastries at the dining trolleys on the walkway, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 a.m. on Monday.
I did not feel that there would be any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the flashy news, I decided not to open a new bank account.
While I was deliberately planning to take care of it during the afternoon rest in the local bank account of JP Morgan Chase, there were already 20 people standing in front of me.
Not at the cashier's window, where you can pick up or deposit money, but at the customer service desk, where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for a route adjustment to Macy's store, and where the new customers are banked.
A lot of people in front of me — I learned later from Starr, the “ordered” banker — were standing in line with the same intent as me.
However, unlike me, they have already taken their money out of smaller banks located in their place of residence, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took money from so-called savings banks (such as housing unions), credit unions, and from small-town savings banks that operate only in a single state and are allegedly treated by the court as a family member.
In the past year, 15 such banks have gone silent.
In recent days, the Washington Mutual, a $327 billion bank, has been under bankruptcy and when the New Yorkers went home on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, sought a bailout with a savings of $440 billion.
The office and shop workers in front of me, afraid of another collapse, transferred their money to a bank that seemed like a safe haven, to the bank that makes the most capital injection purchases on Wall Street.
The simple people in New York have become experts in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman spoke on her phone at a local Chinese store about Lehman Brothers bank and its huge-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if she were complaining about a loose colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform of my apartment block, changed the subject of a 50-year-old caretaker, now we're not talking about Brad and Angelina, or about my food supply, as we used to.
He told me after I walked into the bank: "I invested all my saved money in financial instruments.
I changed, I didn’t risk it.”
Muslim graves were desecrated while Austria was on the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, from the Belgian right-wing party, from Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp, on Thursday, 17 January 2008, in which he presented the "V<0xC3><0xA1>rdos il Tél<0xC3><0xA1>sz<0xC3><0xA1>z<0xC3><0xA1>z<0xC3><0xB3>" at the "V<0xC3><0xA1>rosok I" exhibition.
They were drawn with signs that followed the traffic signs, which depicted red-lined mosques.
According to the police, the extreme right-wing extremists are responsible for the massacre of Austrian Muslim burials, which took place on the same weekend when the far-right parties made significant progress in the country’s parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged in the Traun cemetery next to Linz, sometime between Friday evening and this morning, according to the police.
The perpetrators drew Jewish symbols with paintbrushes, such as the Star of David on some graves, but investigators said they were only trying to hide their extreme motives, which stem from hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident can be linked in any way to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Muslim community said they were "deeply offended" after hearing the funeral, which occurred shortly before the end of the Muslim month of Ramadan.
In the meantime, Austria is conducting an examination of conscience after yesterday’s parliamentary elections, during which the language of political balance has come to the right.
The two far-right parties, which won almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for the Freedom Party and the Alliance’s Future Austria, a strongly anti-immigrant law, and some of their slogans were labeled as alien hate.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the president of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18% of the votes, also expressed his disapproval of the campaign against head chefs and burqas, as well as the food that Islam claims to be linked to.
At the party’s final, Vienna assembly, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” that could help prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the Islamization of Austria and Europe in the process.
According to public opinion polls and analyses conducted directly after the far-right elections, the change was largely due to the young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glittert banned from travelling abroad
Garry Glittert, a well-known rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, was banned by the court from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges then decided, in addition to Glitter's six-month ban, to inform the authorities of his intention to travel to Spain through France.
The Kenyan police obtained a travel ban on Thursday after providing evidence of sexual violence convictions against Glitter that had been brought before the court against children.
Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was not involved in the trial of the Ashford Magistrates in Kent, but was represented by the lawyers of Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: "On Thursday, 25 September, the Kent police filed an application with the Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd did not appear in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because he is required to do so by the law on sexual offences in the register of offenders.
You must notify the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to notify the police at least seven days before the planned departure.
If they do not notify the authorities, they may be sentenced to five years' imprisonment.
The Kent police said they did not want to discuss the specific cases within Glitter County and their possible whereabouts.
A spokesman for the Kenyan police said: “The Kenyan police are doing everything they can to protect children in the country and abroad.
“In our opinion, it is easier to control someone if they do not leave the UK, because we have a comprehensive system at our disposal to deal with potential risks more effectively.
"The main task of the Kent Police is to protect Kent's population. Through close cooperation, we are constantly monitoring the behaviour of persons who are involved in the registration of sexual offences and who live in the county of Kent.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10-year-old and an 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was to board a London-bound plane.
However, he claimed that he felt bad and was not willing to fly to London.
The authorities in Hong Kong did not pass the passport examination, so it eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow entry into the country, so it flew back to Bangkok, where officials from the country’s police and immigration office insisted on returning to the UK.
Finally, on 22 August, he arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3, and remained there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to the West London, uxbridge Court, for a court hearing on the request of the Scotland Yard.
Glitter had previously spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom in 1999 for possession of photographs depicting the rape of children.
According to an interior ministry source, Jacqui Smith, the interior secretary of state, calmly and happily accepted that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
“I don’t take pictures on stage because I want to introduce the artist from a personal point of view.” – G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer
There's no dress, no haircut, no dancing shoes.
The great masters of flamenco are near the body, without the excitement of the performance: to get to know the ordinary face of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the ordinary man.
And these two sides can't be separated, except in the moments that are intimate, distant from the audience, when we can make a personal move, we can capture the depth of a captured look, or we can scratch the face of a non-stage action.
In the German photo series G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer Flamenco-people, he combines the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarists with this less well-known everyday side of the masters.
Through the photos, he presents his own iconography of flamenco from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Photography Month, "reflects the increasing international importance of flamenco from day to day" - the creator believes, adding that the Flamenco-people's "actress could be anyone, because seeing the images, the observer will be able to tap into the images in the blink of an eye.
These people on the street are artists who are capable of taking passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and distracting the audience.
At the same time, stage photography is not suitable for capturing their personality.
Their personality and character live in the deepest depths of their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to inherit the personality of the greats of flamenco with the help of the camera.”
The Cante de las Minas festival was inspired by Bauer’s long journey in 1997, during which he painted portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a disc camera.
Thanks to the camera and the theme selection, this portrait evokes classic photography.
However, the application of various stylistic tools is distinguished by the traditional image depiction and suggests modernity. The following idea faithfully reflects Bauer's idea of the flamenco: "This is a music with traditional roots, which, however, varies from day to day and always ends."
Not the dance, not even the song or the music itself, much more the personality of the artist, the character charms the audience.
In the days of the El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata Gallery, the motif of the works can be seen in order to find the essence of the encounter with artistic magic, which can be seen through the way of perception, existence and appearance.
Famous figures of flamenco, such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are the names of this photo collection that will introduce sixty artists.
The project has also become a flamenco anthology, which will soon release an album featuring portraits presented at the exhibition.
Bauert's passion for portraits was echoed two years ago by the "Portrait of Veteran Athletes" series ("SportARTproject").
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is a bit different, the photographer adds: "I love photographing people, getting to know them and entering their lives for a longer or shorter time.
In my opinion, the most difficult art of photography is portraiture.
You meet people, you meet, you come up with people who you sometimes don’t even know, or who just want to take a few minutes to photograph.
But in spite of these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.
Selected from the contemporary flamenco portraits, the flamenco-people exhibition can be viewed in the El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata Gallery, located under the 20th parallel with Alameda de Herculess, on Calle de la Mata until October 16.
According to Vargas Llosa, the novel he works on is "ready-made blindness"
The location and the action are still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also struggling to write his new novel. The main character of the novel is an Irish nationalist, Roger Caseman, who lived for 20 years in Congo and the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize-winning author at the Hay Festival Segovia also acknowledged yesterday that his current work "is full of perseverance" and "shows all signs that he shouldn't write" the novel.
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope that someday I'll be able to score points for the end" - he concluded his performance with these words at the festival of the exchange of ideas, thoughts and opinions, which he received for four days in the city of Aqueduct, and received daily letters from these writers.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most exciting participants in the celebration of literature, and he also replaced his hopes.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award voted by the participants for an old edition of Dickens' novel "Our Common Friend". His performance was filled by the Juan Bravo Theatre.
A devoted audience after Félix Romeo's greeting was received. A tribute to the audience was soon revealed to the audience that a tribute and a tribute to the Peruvian writer, with amazing memory and a great deal of humor, a tribute to his passion for reading, a tribute to his faith and a desire to live a life of faith.
The Latin American novelist acknowledged that it is impossible to measure or show whether their books are changing our lives, but added: "I don't think that literature is a mere entertainment or a life-altering experience", because it has no effect on people, it has no effect on their minds and minds.
Due to the snowy weather, the farewell in Pozoblanco is shorter, the horse bikaviadalok is also missing
Traditionally held as the closing date for the festivities in Pozoblanco, the horse bikaviadal was cancelled yesterday morning after the following horse torre<0xC3><0xA1>dores found the arena’s terrain unsuitable for the viadal.
As a result, the Commission, with the agreement of Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, decided to leave the bikavia.
The weather conditions had severely disrupted the series of events, as two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the second bikavia was left due to rain.
The main characters, José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista Castilblanc<0xC3><0xB3>i, would have fought bullies.
It was only on Friday that a bi-weekly meeting was held.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who took three ears home as a trophy, and after a sophisticated and aesthetic struggle, they were brought up on their shoulders.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante, through his two biceps, earned a number of awards and trophies, but he was more grateful to the audience than to his own performance.
After that, however, El Juli followed, who contributed little to the aging of the Los Llanos arena's reputation.
After a comfortable walk with the second bike, most of the audience managed to get out of the car.
In the basement, a two-ton truck carrying a donkey tried to escape from the road control
Four hours and fifty minutes in the morning.
The Basque Regional Police conducts traffic control in the administrative area of Armin<0xC3><0xB3>n (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
The authorities are stopping a van in which two people are travelling, and the passengers are trying to escape the action.
The shipment, more than two tons of hasis, at the same time was not remarkable.
Investigators pursued the passengers and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and identified as A. A. J., the interior ministry of the Basque government said.
The arrested man is charged with drug trafficking and document tampering.
The incident took place in the administrative area of Armin<0xC3><0xB3>n, where employees of the <0xC3><0x81>lava Traffic Authority carried out traffic checks on the N-1 motorway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave him gas, and then left the checkpoint.
Investigators took him into the chase, then the vehicle stopped on the runway a few kilometers away, and his passengers fled from the highway to a forested area.
The Basque Regional Police eventually seized one of them, and after reviewing the Iveco Daily-branded van, seized its shipment, weighing 2,178 kilograms.
The body was transported by the police to the rear of the vehicle to carry out a more thorough investigation and detect the drug.
In addition, during the inspection, it was established that the false license plate of the vehicle does not match the data contained in the documents of the van, and therefore they initiate proceedings against the arrested for counterfeiting of public cards.
The Basque Regional Police is continuing the investigation, which is intended, on the one hand, to arrest the other suspect, who, as we have already mentioned, has fled the highway, and on the other hand, to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old accused, A.A.J., was taken to the police to carry out the necessary interrogations, and within a few hours the court proceedings began.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of the drug.
Heather Locklear, a popular actress in the Melrose Place series, was arrested by police in Santa Barbara, California on weekends because she was driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness said he was trying to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange maneuvers, a spokesman for the California traffic watchdog told People magazine.
According to the witness, at about 1630 hours Locklear "printed the gas up to the floor, enlarged the engine, tried to leave the parking lot in front and back, and in the rear it passed through the sunglasses several times."
Not long after, the witness, who probably did not recognize the actress for the first time, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also informed the police because he was "worried about Locklear's life."
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which partially paralyzed the traffic of the highway.
"It seemed to be tempting", which is why the inspectors took the drug and alcohol tests to a specialized center for this.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was a co-operator, and alcohol consumption was almost immediately banned, and the spokesperson also said that, based on the first impression of the officers, Locklear was under the influence of the drug.
Locklear was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of an unidentified device. He was taken to the local prison around 7 p.m., where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of an Arizona sanatorium two months ago, where he was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the Andalucian Federation of the IU (United Left) to take action on the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, the Secretary-General of the IU and a representative of the United Left, today announced that the regional federation of the formed will make a decision in the case of the Seville Municipal Government, former Youth and Sports Councillor Francisco Manuel Silva.
“In these matters, I am far from a federalist, and this case is certainly within the control of the Andalusian organization,” Llamazares pointed out to the procedure to be applied against the party’s former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that when detecting any irregularities committed by Silva, the "transparency" should be kept in mind: "The IU has always been leveled above the maximum transparency of such cases."
He added that part of the training was "for the general public as well as for the strict code of ethics."
"Majus blood", the epic work of Garci
Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’ National Episodes was inspired by José Luis Garci, who evokes the famous anti-French uprising of the Spaniards in the blood of May, which, with a budget of almost 15 million euros, is the biggest work of his filmography.
Accordingly, the director tried to illustrate in the work of the well-known novelist always a wonderful human resource and social analysis. Today, in the film presentation Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a, Garci told the audience of the actors.
More than two-and-a-half hours of May blood will be presented in the cinema on Friday, and Telemadrid will later be quoted as a miniseries in a range of more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’s literature, made his childhood dream come true with this film. He thanks all this to Esperanza Aguirr<0xC3><0xAD>, for he entrusted it three years ago from the Province of Madrid to make a commemorative film on May 2nd.
The budget of 15 million would be financed entirely by the Autonomous Province of Madrid, and Garci was given a special opportunity: he could present the "disturbed Spaniards, who stood by the wrong leader" for the sake of his independence.
However, the director expressed his regret that he could not count on the budget of the ghosts of Alatriste or Goya, who had more than doubled the blood of May. Therefore, he had to leave out some scenes from the screenplay, which - like many other times - Horacio Valc<0xC3><0xA1>.
So the director of the Restart went to his usual mode of work, he took up the scenes with the actors with whom he had already started the rehearsals before filming. Casting was not, because Garci considered it "depressive", and because, as he put it, "the director
Several actors of the May blood, such as Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not appear in front of his camera for the first time.
Garci - who can boast of four Oscar nominations and an Oscar award - believes that this year's nominees representing Spain before the Hollywood Academy, i.e. the Blood of May, the Seven French Billiards table, and the ultimately elected Blind Sunflowers, should not be one of their own.
Garci with this film doesn't count for awards.
“At first you think you’re working for the afterlife, and then you realize that only happiness matters, and then you’re happy when you finish another movie,” says Garci, who’s 30 years behind the scenes.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n recalls the life and art of the Sevillian dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville is also remembered as a dancer from Seville.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, from the Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and the Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valencia Valencia), was born in Triana district and moved to London with her parents at the age of three.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in Eastern dances.
During his active life, he fought as a pioneer for women’s equality, including Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and fought against wearing a wig that impeded women's freedom of movement.
A dance and aesthetic revolution broke out in war-torn Europe, and her life was hijacked by Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gambo, he recommended Tortola to me, whose personality really impressed."
The flamenco dancer said: "Our goal is not to tell the story of her life, but to capture her soul.
I remember the names of his dances in flamenco styles.
For example, the "snake dance" in guaji, or the "snake dance" in tango.
“She danced sensibly and, according to others, that’s what characterizes my style,” he says.
The light of the performance is enhanced by two extraordinary collaborators: Miguel Poveda now sings again after the Open Door in Isabel’s performance; and Matilde Coral, who in this case wanted to work exceptionally with a former student.
"Matilde shapes the older Tortola, the mature woman.
I'm glad he said yes to the request, it's a great honor that he's performing in my piece."
In addition, the production includes Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga musical directors and guitarists, Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro percussionist, Rafael El Viola percussionist, and Juanfra Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, who is "the constant character of the real diva."
The piece also largely depicts the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe, and at that time even reaches distant lands, including India, the United States, or Italy.
“I wanted to remind him because his personality had a big impact on his own age, but today he is no longer known and even less appreciative of his work,” Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n says.
The performance will begin tonight at 8 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium will also appear the "Journal of a newly married poet"
The first illustrated edition of A Poet's Diary of a Freshly Married Man will be presented in the volume "Culture" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where in May 1916 Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia. The volume of the volume "Zenobia" and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Triennium (2006-2008)
In this way, Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Triennium conclude the re-release of the said work, the restoration of the International Congress in New York, the Nobel Prize-winning poet’s memorial and the New Yorker’s “Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: The Enlightened Summer Tree” in his book The New York Times.
The Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government has obtained a total of eight hundred copies from the diary of a newly married poet, published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to popularize the reputation and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America is not so attractive.
“Sometimes God makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that.”
The quote comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with Newman in the film Victims of Sensation, and reflects the shock and impossibility that Newman’s death in American cinema and caused throughout America.
How hard it was to get an Oscar.
He retired in 2007,
He was known to be ill,
But even so, he caused everyone's death.
“Sometimes it’s impossible to put our feelings into words, and I just lost a good friend,” said Robert Redford, “his life has made my life and this country better.”
No one was afraid that he might become ridiculous or overreacted.
One of the heroes of the movie and home went through a particularly dark period that was shadowed by fears of terrorism and market relations, the search for American self-esteem and a desperate quest for dignity.
When such difficult times pass and many easily lose their value and very few people remain who we can look up to, then it doesn’t have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of the people, he embodied with reality the Platonic beauty and justice.
Richard Nixon was the formal enemy and defender of lost and won cases, starting with the creation of a drug-resistant foundation created in memory of his first-born son who died in drug overdose, from the creation of the domestic bio-food brand.
It was a real gift for a country that could hardly survive in a culture of suicidal feeding.
The breathtaking wave of wonder has entered all of Hollywood, regardless of nationality and origin.
The last James Bond, according to Englishman Daniel Craig, is not a man, but an era has passed away with him.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winner Sam Mendes, said his joint work with Newman clearly marked the culmination of his career.
Russell Crowe has named Newman, a bad boy from Australia, as his biggest inspiration.
“He’s made the ladder very high for all of us,” said George Clooney, one of the few people who try to follow Paul Newman’s way of life today: it requires honesty and privacy away from serious and cameras.
It’s not always easy if it’s possible in the middle of today’s media jungle.
Still, there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman's an example.
She divorced once, but then lived in a faithful marriage for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, and there would have been certainly many opportunities for infidelity.
"Why do I eat a hamburger somewhere else when the fried meat is waiting at home?" he joked.
In heaven, it can be proud that the daughters of the earth are also fans, which is not too common in America.
“None of his creations were as proud as his faithful husband, loving father, caring grandfather, and devoted human friend,” they say.
The Long Road to the Olympic Games in Madrid
In fact, many of us dream of a Madrid Olympics, and after 2012 failed, it may be 2016.
But, I ask, are we really prepared for it?
Because if we start from last night's race, I don't think so at all.
They called it a perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst of many I've ever been.
The cluster of misunderstandings was characterized, and if it were to be evaluated once, and I would be the examiner, the result would be clearly flawed.
But let's go in line and start at the beginning.
The inconsistencies began with the taking over of fate, for that is why it had to come earlier.
This is not a problem in itself yet, but if you are going to go sooner, at least get everything at once (including the chip, the subsequent queue should be avoided).
Well, that didn't happen.
At first they gave only the lucky number (the first nonsense, just to go there earlier) and (after the usual standing), which was surprising, it was only an S-shirt (the second nonsense, because to me it was just XL-size)!
What kind of world do we live in?
Or was it because of the crisis that they decided to save the material and just buy cheaper, smaller T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still blurry compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that the chip had to be taken over early, the queue position took 15 minutes from arrival, and even the backpack had to be handed down.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't given up the backpack yet, and when it finally did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made the wait of more than 40 minutes even more pleasant, which was considered to be population ascent and stand-off experiments.
I think we're going to get 500 pneumonias tomorrow, and some, myself included, we're not going to get our position in real time, because I'm assuming my chip misplaced the start.
If you were to ask me about the perfect race, this would of course not come to mind by accident.
So I think we can continue our dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Looking for Microsoft (virtual) reception
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft demonstrated the development of a new imaging and human interaction system, using a kind of - not too intelligent - artificial intelligence, which, however, is able to perform some basic tasks in Microsoft's field of expertise. For example, it can take a taxi (for example,
This "reception" of a camera and a form and facial recognition system is able to recognize how many are in the room, who they are - even notice what they are wearing - as well as hear and understand the key words of their conversations.
In addition, based on the discussions, you can group the attendees.
In the introductory video, the receptionist identifies a third person, but she knows that she does not belong to the company she is talking to and is not even an employee of the company.
He asks if he has come to visit someone and assures him that he will soon be in a hurry to help.
It's all without the blue screen.
Impressive.
This is, of course, the music of the future.
At present, the company has a more important task, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, a lot of people have said that Microsoft has become a strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and contain fewer add-ons.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers were to run only the necessary programs instead of the many commercial binoculars, then the machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's something.
They invented the Spanish message, given that Microsoft has added additional features and extras to Windows in all new versions so far.
The change of direction is coming back.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is increasingly in need of a background, and so is the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I also joined the theory that Google took the first step towards becoming a Windows competitor.
Many have correctly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as an indispensable element for the interfacing of hardware and software.
It plays the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to calculate the "death" of the operating system, not in absolute, but in a relative sense.
Ballmer’s statement this week underscores this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more and more to the web browser.
We turn your computer on only to open Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and more time spent browsing than we spend in the world of windows.
What happens to the majority of applications that come with the system?
Fewer times more.
And Windows 7 should be much less, much less than Vista.
It's less heavy, it's less literate, it's less complicated.
Microsoft’s goal is to integrate its services online, and to ultimately offer an alternative to Google.
All they need is an example of why, let me give you an example.
At the beginning of the month, I took this photo in a Microsoft-applicated lounge in Redmond.
At the vending machine, he calls them up a poster, they use the company's browser, "Your browser, our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the Internet.
By the way, last week a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, rather in 2010.
Microsoft is likely to be trying to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 into a joint market.
After all, the mobile phone is increasingly functioning as a computer.
But the slide, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely ruin their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
This was worn by Pablo Picasso of the Costa Azulon, by Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick Blood Diamond, and by Al Pacino in the Francis Ford Coppola Crusader, and is also one of the staples of this busted gay shopping community.
And if we are already on the list of specialities, we can even recall the peaceful figure of the cuckoo’s weightlifter, the cuckoo’s cuckoo.
But what are we talking about? It's nothing more than a man's cotton jersey, which is typically tight and fingerless.
That is, from the "tank", as the English call it, but no competitor with Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles can compete.
First of all, because of its elegant name - although only referred to among friends as "Marcel" - which the sport owes, according to legend, it got its name from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel’s excellent sample material, unisex trim, distinctive emblem and the small (almost recognizable) Belgian flag also stand out among his competitors. This is the last of the most distinctive models that are worn hidden in the neck of the shirt.
But the Belgian company is not only making tank tops.
Sports tops, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, woolen sweaters, navy t-shirts, baby clothes, mini skirts - and more - all belong to the company's products.
And they're all in the category of comfortable underwear,
Even though it is sad that they should be worn as underwear.
They're too good for that.
“I want to be a young mother, no matter who the father is.”
He is very similar to his brother, but at the same time he has managed to realize himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but full of energy.
Currently, the Cruz sisters want to take a more serious role in the world of fashion.
For Monica, modeling means a lot more than that, as some pretty and pretty girls give their name to something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango’s new headquarters in Paris, as well as at the handing over of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
There is warmth and tenderness that comes from it.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We present Mango’s new autumn-winter collection, which we designed with my brother, Penélope. In addition, we participate in the opening of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and in the gala evening in honor of Valentino at the Opera.
It's a pretty intense day, it's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango. Where did you find the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the movies of the '50s and '60s, and we've taken a lot of it from there.
And then, I often just walk around the city and pay attention to women, how they dress, how they vary and choose their clothes - this is one of my favorite pastimes.
You work as a dancer, as an actress, and as a fashion designer, you're a versatile woman, right?
I think so too, but in the end these three things are related, because there are a lot of them in common.
I was interested in clothes when I was a child, I could hardly wait to go to my grandmother's and hang out in my grandmother's wardrobes.
Well, that was you in Canada, you almost got up there with a couple of cheerleaders.
And then, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to my clothes.
You know, we dancers like to figure out our own style for hours and tests to make us feel good when we look in the mirror.
And in the role of the actress, you'll really identify with your role when you get the dress.
You see, everything has to do with everything, and all my respect for the designers and their expertise.
You've just celebrated your 30th birthday, haven't you been to Lethargy?
Oh, no!
I feel better than ever, I love my 30s.
I think women are really reaching that point, they've had enough experience and they're making fewer mistakes in life.
The biological clock is not concerned.
Ever since I was a child, I've been doing what I love, and it's filled with great inner happiness.
Do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother, because I was born to be a woman, and I want to be a young mother, and I don’t want to miss that.
And as for the next father, it doesn't matter who he is.
I want to raise my child with happiness and great-great-great-love.
Let's just say a few words about the movie, and last year you shot more movies that weren't even shown.
Sure, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started in the theater, am very impatient and restless, I want everything at once, but of course I know that this is impossible.
I can't wait to present The Last Hour and the search for the tomb of Christ.
I wonder what you say to them...
If I know, you made your debut a few days ago on the run with Naomi Campbell.
Well, no, that's not true...
I didn't go up to the exit as a model.
I have known Naomi Campbellt for a long time, and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London, organized for the benefit of her own organization called Women for a better world. I chose two of my own Mango collections. The presented clothes were bought-in, bought-in
People don't even know how kind Naomi is.
There's so much about it, I know, and I can assure you that half of it's not true.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of his activity.
She asked me to do something nice at the fashion show, but if she wanted me to stand up, I'd do it.
If the fate of women living in the third world is the bet, I do not know the impossible.
Relapsed drinking drivers will be required to install the "Alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior, after a three-drink driving rule violation, would oblige the car to install a structure that would prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver is in an alcoholic state or does not blow into the structure.
The proposal was circulated in June and is currently being dealt with by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, according to which the pilot project will take a year.
As the project aims to restore traffic, the driver will also have to take part in a repeat course on transport education.
In addition to the General Directorate of Transport Safety (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Automotive Safety Technology (FITSA) participate in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of cars arrested several times due to drunk driving are sitting in the car again.
This would be prevented by the Alcoholock, since the system connected to the vehicle determines the level of the inhaled air. If it is larger than the permitted one, or if the driver does not blow into the device at all, the system does not allow to start the car.
The cost of the more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1000 instrument would be charged to the offender.
A study conducted in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices could reduce the number of violations by as much as 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could save their lives every year.
The measure focuses on violations of the rules for two reasons: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent them from committing crimes,
on the other hand, it is easier to introduce, since the implementation of the legal reform takes place in the usual medre, while the necessary criminal reform would require a fundamental amendment of the law.
The instrument is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although in experimental mode some industrial and utility vehicles have already been fitted.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which, as a French model, is responsible for the installation of the system into school buses.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
With English accuracy, at the time announced in the program, the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force's Asturias Princess Party, the president of Mexico City's Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez Airport, landed at 17 hours and 40 minutes.
The sun was already down, but it was still so hot that we could only see the royal party coming out of the plane using our hands as an eye-catcher.
At the foot of the stairs stood the Spanish ambassador and other high-ranking figures.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princess Couple was coming to the city for an official visit.
- Well, great, then there won't be an airport transfer today... the woman is real or something...
- No, no, sir, Mrs. Spanish, she only lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or so...
But the Mexican press knows everything about the Asturias Princess Couple and the importance of their visit.
Many are waiting at the airport’s red carpet, at the line made by the 27 sailors, who see the protection of the dignity.
The Prince appears, smiling, in a sea-blue dress, and then the Princess, in her long hair, in the wind, in her restrained clothing, but not in the usual shoes, which look like shoes - perhaps warned that she is threatening Mexico City with a storm.
For a moment, they stop and smile at the cameras, and then they enter the room where the official bet follows.
At the gate of their hotel, which is one of the city’s four largest hotels, they are greeted by a reporter from one of Mexico’s hundreds of soap operas.
The Most Valuable Fashion Award
For a fashion award, the world’s most suitable place is undoubtedly Paris, and among the fashion designers who live today, Valentino is the most refined and the most elusive.
Mango recently announced the second edition of the El Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards, aimed at internationalising the young talents of the fashion industry.
The main prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first bid, saw her own design clothes in the Mango outlet under Paris boulevard Haussmann 54, and was relieved of the power.
In addition, it is the company’s second largest European business and recently opened at 1335 square meters.
The largest store is located in London.
In the midst of the cheerleading event and the thanks given to Valentino - who is running for the chairmanship of the jury - we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
In the company of the most enthusiastic Chagals, the presidential table prepared by Mango for the gala dinner was even more spectacular.
Nati, who had recently passed away with a heavy heart and sadness because of his brother’s death, wore one of the Company’s pieces and some of the ELAH’s breath-taking gems. He accompanied Valentino to his dinner with his two-meter-high son, Luis, to the banquet.
And the owner and host of the Mango entertained the guests. At the university with Baron Rotchil they were so knighted that they ended up without a suit, as they both gave it to one or another lady.
Monica Cruz came into the store in her own design pants and ing, and at dinner she was wearing a sexy long black dress. On the night of the opera visit to the company of Gaya Toledo, she was so engrossed in the ballet room that she remembered the old times and smirked at the same time.
Inés Sastre did not attend the palace visit, but he showed some photos of his son on his mobile.
The next morning in Oliver Martinez we were able to enjoy ourselves - he will also walk two meters high and with a motor - and John Travolta also arrived at the Intercontinental hotel in Paris. He also brought his own plates and towels with him, and said in advance that there was no smell in the room.
Stars under the starry Paris sky.
Oh there, it's life.
1001, the stress-relieving number
It's not 1,000, it's 1000, and there's one way to get rid of the chaotic and messy everyday.
Another good news is that you can find them all in one book, which will arrive at the bookstores on September 30 to bring peace with you.
It’s almost torture to watch at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to think about how fast-paced life is forcing the day to day in today’s world.
The name of the office is tension, and the computer is back pain.
Stress is the population disease of the 21st century.
But there are no one and no two ways to combat daily fatigue and to overcome workplace problems.
No, this number is exactly equal to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book, so that everyone can find a solution for their favorite and free minutes.
The stress-relieving work is entitled 1001 Relaxation Method, and the calm that flows from it comes from the Pearson Alhambra y DK publisher to the bookstores.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will surely save you from your faith.
In fact, it also serves with other ideas that all help relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make up to 100% natural food.
If your adrenaline level is too low to refresh your body and your stress life has become a central problem, it’s time to sit back in the chair, relax, and just focus on reading.
Those who speak in their dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I’m not talking about those who wake up and tell you what happened to them that day, but about those who talk while they’re asleep.
The phenomenon may seem frightening at first, but in fact it is completely harmless.
This type of sleep disorder is called somniloquismus.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure most of you have been told that you spoke at night.
With regard to its frequency, it can be completely rapsodic (for example, occurs only once in a disease with a high fever), or more regularly (daily, weekly or monthly once), and usually the next day the child does not remember anything.
Your appearance can't be traced back to a single trigger cause.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, nighttime ejaculation, nighttime bed rest (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking, but this is also not legal.
As we have already mentioned, a condition with high fever, or even a stressful or heightened state of excitement, may also be accompanied.
So far, very little has been studied.
The intensity of the speech is also very variable.
It can be dead, calm, stand out from unrelated words, from snoring, but unlike all of these, it can also occur in the form of screaming, crying, or prolonged speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and turn to a specialist. The examination can reveal whether there is a problem causing a great deal of anxiety in the background and thus offer a solution.
As already mentioned, it is a benign phenomenon, therefore, there is no cure for it unless it is accompanied by some other, treatable form of sleep disorder (e.g., insomnia or stress).
However, there are a few things we can do, here is a pre-emptive measure:
Make sure that the child is calm before going to bed.
We choose calming games and avoid having your child watch scary or more aggressive TV shows or TV shows or series.
For children who are prone to nervousness or who are more difficult to relax, we teach some relaxation methods to make it easier to find inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep more comfortably.
However, if you start talking while you sleep, we try to maintain our peace of mind.
Remember, this is harmless to the child, and they will not remember anything the next day.
Useful Advices
Don't wake the child up.
It would be superfluous, because the child is not conscious, but it would get out of sleep.
Despite the fact that he speaks, he actually sleeps and rests.
Do not forget, if multiple times a strong anxiety accompanies the phenomenon, it is advisable to contact or expose a specialist, what will replace the child with a high degree of anxiety.
If you speak clearly (this is the rarest case), don’t start questioning them to find out anything from them.
It would also be unnecessary, since during sleep you are not so conscious as to gather your thoughts.
On the other hand, you only hear the speech, but you do not see the dreams associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of the hearers and the possible conclusions.
Never tell a child that they can ask about their secrets at night.
It's not even a joke.
This caused a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it's just a few minutes of harmless episode.
Finally, the Illhaeusern
After a long deep flight, the Illhaeusern team finally took on a new impetus and won again on the domestic track.
Although there was no ferocious match, the yellow-blacks were put into a position several times, one of which they were able to finally win by exploiting one.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers could hardly feel the right rhythm.
The first shot of the goalkeeper was fired by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the distant ball only touched the top corner of the goalkeeper. Then the Illhaeusern was overrun, and the shots were followed by: Fonderflick with a distant shot of the goal, with a shot from the goal, with a shot from the goal.
On the other side, the players were locked into a block in the middle of the field, and only the ever-moving Riahi got into a shooting position.
The start of the second half was promised a decisive importance: first Riahi and Temporale took a position on the side of Dannemarie. Immediately after that the first goal was born: Diebold's first shot. he knocked out the ball of the illhaeuserni Marais, the excellent place of the bowler.
However, Illhausern's goaltender could not enjoy the glory for long: twelve minutes later he was forced to leave the track, so his teammates had to continue the fight in a humane manner.
Dannemarie, on the other hand, could not take advantage of it: they did not cause much trouble for the home team, who just pulled back a little to strengthen their defense. Only the last few seconds were worth some excitement when a large fence fell after a large fence.
Sarkozy meets with angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes an appearance in Brittany.
The demonstration, held by fishermen on Monday, encouraged the traffic of several Breton and Norman ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided on Tuesday morning to make a visit to the port of Le Guilvinec in Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re to meet with the representatives of the protesters.
The latter promised to accept the president "in a constructive spirit" and expressed their absolutist hope that Sarkozy would come up with "concrete proposals".
The presidential visit coincides with the meeting of the "crisis committee", created by Breton fishermen with the aim of initiating action against the rise in the price of gas oil, as the oil spill exceeded a record average of 1.14 euros per litre.
David Martinon, a spokesman for the President of the Republic, said the president "will discuss with the fishermen what solutions can help companies regain their competitiveness and make it safer for seafarers to work conditions and to hire them."
The fishermen are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvados County, causing nearly 10 km of tremors.
The transportation of Quiberon's yacht port was also improved, but the roads leading to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le were not closed.
Routers have been deployed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors had already given evidence of their readiness, and in the morning they set fire to tires and pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the Brest ports, while demonstrations were taking place in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in the Atlantic and other ports of La Manche, for example, in the Sables d'Olonne of Vendée, the fishermen did not board the ship, while in Le Havre about twenty ships blocked the trading ships.
In the Loire-Atlantique county, La Turballe and Le Croisic's fishermen stopped the massive Total oil refinery block in Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer, however, decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting in the ministry with a decision on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on its next step and its participation in the meeting planned at the Paris Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the Heads of the National Fisheries Committee, as the Commission did not support their efforts.
"The strike is continuing" because "fishers are not allowed to make their demands" and "are not willing to travel to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Official fishermen who do not pay tax on gas oil are currently paying about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the operation of a ship would only become profitable if the price of gas oil fell below 0.30 euros per litre.
The Wonderful Paul Newman
"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", an unforgettable title character, is connected to his home at the age of 83 as a result of his death from a cancerous disease.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes also paid tribute to the 83-year-old film legend and actor Paul Newman.
Embraer does not change its 2008 delivery plans
Despite the global economic crisis, the Brazilian airline is planning to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, the company’s president.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer is very much counting on the Chinese market, especially for its 30-120-seat aircraft.
Embraer has delivered a total of 41 aircraft to Chinese customers over the past eight years.
AIG would value more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, an insurance company set up by the U.S. financial authorities, wants to sell more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion in advance, the Dominican edition of the Financial Times said.
In addition to its international life insurance and U.S. pension insurance activities, AIG would be bailed out by almost every other business in the world, the paper said, citing sources close to the case.
According to the Times, AIG’s board of directors sat down on Sunday evening to examine the possibilities of sales.
AIG has not confirmed this information.
AIG’s proposed facility includes the airline’s International Lease Financial Corp., a 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity portfolio, and its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings.
According to the newspaper, however, there is no final decision on the sale.
AIG needs to quickly get to liquid assets to repay the $85 billion loan approved by the U.S. government. This takes the risk that it will have to become as much as 80% of its capital, and will share accordingly.
Study of the Paris Historique at the Morning Meeting of the Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic decline on Monday, after the Senate rejected Paulson’s bailout plan. The Dow Jones index fell by 6.98% (which has never seen a nearly 800-point decrease), with Nasdaq 14%, and 9.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) was down by 777.68 points, closing by 10 365.45 points.
The largest decline in the index to date (point 684.81) was recorded on 17 September 2001, when the trade resumed following the terrorist attack on 11 September.
The Nasdaq, which is mainly based on technological papers, closed at 1983.61 points, while the Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) decreased by 1 106.55 points, according to official closing data.
The Wall Street stock market was already weakening at the time of its opening, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected a bailout plan to restore market balance, it began to go deep.
With 228 “no” votes against, 205 “yes” votes were rejected to secure the funds requested by Finance Minister Henry Paulson.
The plan was cut by nearly two-thirds of Republicans.
“From this, the market has filtered out bad signals because it seems that Congress is unable to approve a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial analyst.
“It also shows how much the market expected for this plan,” he added, and then expressed concern that if a few days later they would adopt such a plan, it would be “too late.”
“If the plan is indeed doomed to death (...), then the Fed (the U.S. central bank – the structure) and other central banks will be in a row to deal with the crisis, and lending conditions will continue to tighten,” warned Global Insight’s Brian Bethune.
To further increase the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: “every day in the past, more and more financial institutions are going to fail” in the United States.
Following the Friday collapse of the Washington Mutual, the authorities made sure that Wachovia’s bank branches were purchased by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, which has made emergency measures necessary to save banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux States, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market "is not only a US, but a global financial crisis is emerging" - te.
The bond market is very much alive.
The 10-year current-term bond fell from 3.827% on Friday evening to 3.632% and the 30-year-old fell from 4.357% on the previous day to 4.161%.
Obama won his first TV match.
The two U.S. presidential nominees followed their first debate on Friday, followed by another, who had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would come out as the winner.
Unsurprisingly, those responsible for both the Republican and Democratic campaign claimed victory for themselves in the television match that was watched by one-third of American households.
According to political analyst David Gergen, although John McCain's performance was respectable, it did not prove to be "amazing" enough to stop the decline in popularity: this is evidenced by five weeks of pre-election polls.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democratic nominee stands better in the fight: according to the results of the public opinion poll published on Saturday, Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49%).
Among the most calculating, yet undecided voters, 39 percent of those polled said Obama would win, while 25 percent of those polled expect McCain to win, according to a survey by CBS.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with his partner, Joseph Biden's brilliantly promising Thursday role. He is geared up for Biden's first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
Bill Clinton, however, warned this weekend: “It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
They have good feelings.”
McCain, who is in his 70s, never forgets to put his own, undisputedly huge foreign policy experience in the forefront. He also emphasizes his opponent’s “invitation” to these issues, which were the focus of their first personal meeting.
"It seems that Senator Obama doesn't understand that..." the attack sounded several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary for the presidency," McCain said.
This is the main attack surface, which is also used by Republican TV ads running since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that he represents the future.
He did not allow himself to be disturbed: summed up and accurately conceived.
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain still doesn’t get it, but Obama does,” Obama said in a televised ad on the weekend, citing the Republican leader that he still hasn’t measured the impact of the crisis on the “people of the U.S. streets.”
“During the nine-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in front of tens of thousands of people who gathered in a thunderstorm in North Carolina.
He didn't even utter the words "middle class" or "workers" in his mouth. The financial world is in no doubt in favor of Obama, whom the Americans consider the most suitable to save on the verge of collapse.
"It could prove to be the turning point of the next seven," said Charles Schumer, the influential Democratic senator.
A Democrat, Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of the Clinton administration, said Obama had “excellent economic incentives” like Bill Clinton at the time of the 1998 financial crisis.
In the Democratic presidential nominee’s view, the current crisis is the “final verdict on the eight-year-long bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain.”
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite the stock market fluctuations, it will be able to reduce the tax burden of 95% of Americans. He added that among its primary objectives is the creation of possible energy independence of the country through the creation of renewable energy sources, renewable energy sources and renewable energy sources.
McCain plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, the two president-elects carefully avoided the issues that were related to the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) bailout plan: the highly unpopular plan was adopted by Congress last night.
Minsk: "Did you notice that there was an election here?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening in the capital of Belarus to reject the expected results of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, after the polling stations were closed, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in Minsk’s main square to protest against the ousting of the election results.
Although no results have been announced, many young people protested against President Alexander Lukashenko with the following words: "Dictator, resign!".
Some admit that they didn't even go to vote, "Why would I go? They do what they want with my vote," says a young man.
Protesters do not believe that the regime, which tried to stand up to foreign observers in a good way in order to establish a relationship with the European Union, would be ready for a democratic regime change.
If the elections were judged to be fair by observers, they could solve the country’s sanctions, under which 40 white-collar leaders were denied the visa and some bank accounts were frozen.
However, according to the opposition, the elections were not clear.
“We were kept away from the election committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count,” said Yuri Potyemkin, a spokesman for the United Democratic Forces coalition, which was organized by the twelve parties.
"The changes were only nominal," said Aleksandar Milinkievics, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is to figure out who will vote, and in our case this is the executive power.
If the opposition’s envoys enter parliament, it means that they have been appointed and not elected.
But their entry into parliament allows them to have a place on television, to sit in the regions of the country, and to submit legislative proposals.
The opposition, therefore, needs to be brought to the fore in political life, because "the dialogue with the European Union must be initiated".
For if our heavily-sold economy against Russia is in crisis and we are unable to renew, we risk falling under Russia’s sovereignty.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is of the opinion that the European Security and Cooperation Organisation, which takes into account the process of the elections, accepts the result of the vote as valid.
It is emphasized that the participation rate seems too high and the broad organisation of the vote (which was attended by 26% of the electorate in Minsk) gave the opportunity for any manipulation.
"Did you notice that there was an election here?" - asks the leader of the Social Democratic Party of Aleksandr Kozulin, who was last released in August with a second sentence from the prison where he was held as a political prisoner.
No one was in the polling stations.
A maximum of five opposition representatives will be admitted to the parliament, and those who are most in line with the leadership.
In the middle of October, the silence of the night is again.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are delighted.
The blood is safe again.
The tenth anniversary of the founding of Héma-Québec yesterday was a good reason for the celebration, because Héma-Québec has now become one of the safest and most effective blood-sucking companies in the world.
And most importantly, it has succeeded in regaining people’s trust, which was severely damaged by the blood-infested scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well-known, the national blood reserve managed by the Canadian Red Cross blood transfusion service was infected with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
After the drama and the general upsurge, the Government of Canada launched an official investigation in February 1994 under the leadership of Judge Horace Krever. Its purpose was to shed light on what circumstances led to the tragedy and to put forward proposals for the future.
While presenting a delayed report by Judge Krever, some provinces set up their own committee to design a new blood management system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee has completed this task.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood-sucking services were established in Canada: one in Quebec serving Héma-Québec and the other in Canada's Blood-sucking Society responsible for the supply of all the other provinces and the two territories.
“When Héma-Québec started its activities in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in the Quebec blood-sucking system,” Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was deplorable.
"In the years to come, however, we have managed to regain people's trust as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the field." Décary proudly reports that by the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the population in Quebec had already been able to trust Hécé.
Dr. Décary, however, does not forget that “trust is extremely fragile.”
Since the founding of Héma-Québec on 28 September 1998, the principle of caution has been applied.
During this period, there have been a number of cases in Europe where a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease has also infected people - says the doctor, who has managed the company since its inception in 1998.
"We didn't even know if the disease was spreading through the blood.
That is why we relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports. According to the fact that if we are uncertain in this and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, then we should apply exclusive measures. In this case, the cause of the Creutzfeldt-Ja disease was
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not receive blood from people who have spent more than a month in the UK since 1980.
A few years ago, however, all doubts were made that the disease spread even through the blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a technique appeared on the market that makes HIV virus diagnosis much more sensitive. This is a nucleic acid test (NAT), which in the blood of blood clots is able to directly detect the virus, and not the antibodies that are formed against the virus, which are used in the testicles in the past.
With the help of the NAT test, we were able to shorten the window period, which lasts from infection until we can show the virus through our technical means in the blood - explained the specialist.
This period was able to be reduced for a shorter period of time than a week.
Thus, they significantly mitigated the risk of blood clots infecting the blood vessels beyond our control, as well as of not being able to show this.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of the spread of AIDS by the way of blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of someone getting HIV-infected blood is 12 million to one.
“In a nutshell, this means that we should distribute 12 million blood products until someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400-500,000 blood preparations every year, it should take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and someone to be infected with HIV through a blood preparation.
I think that today, anyone can take it easy or sign up for blood transfusions to restore health,” says the first-ever leader of Héma-Québec.
“The challenge for the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what new pathogens are entering the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the blood with an insect bite.
That's why we need to be constantly vigilant," continued Dr. Décary, and then stressed that, in addition to the emergency supplies, Héma-Québec has to take care of enough permanent supplies.
“As the population ages, so do the demands.
As anti-cancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has an impact on the blood supply, as the number of people in the network who are eligible for bleeding accounts for only 3% of the Quebec population.
However, any healthy person, who is at least 18 years old, can give blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not receive blood because they have been infected with AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have been in a country where malaria is being eradicated have not been allowed to bleed for a year.
“With this 3 percent, we have enough reserves that we can meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare for us to get out of stock.
However, we need to increase the number of bloodsuckers to the extent that they age because they can no longer give blood after a while.
But it’s very difficult to convince people to give blood, but it’s even harder to keep them and make them become regular blood clots.
In today’s fast-paced world, one hour is barely enough to get away with giving blood.” – Francine Décary
Hema-Québec, which has a budget of $297 million per year, provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and personal tissue, which are rarely used.
These tissues are analysed, transformed and frozen, and then placed in Héma-Québec, which at the same time also manages a single public stem cell bank in Quebec.
The blood from the cervix treated only as a medical waste can be obtained, which is rich in stem cells, thus also allowing the treatment of serious diseases (e.g. leukemia).
“We celebrated a few weeks ago that we have entered our bank with the thousandth baby blood sample, and we plan to take more than a thousand new samples every year.
At the beginning of next year, we are likely to start offering these for organ transplants," said Dr. Décary, who said that the blood clotting program is very popular today.
“Many mothers are sad that they don’t have a chance to do this” – this is indeed the case, as Héma-Québec is not in a position to make this complex and expensive program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Football - The Impact in Predecessor
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounders in the USL-1 draft yesterday at 3:1, and with a combined 4:3 result they came in the lead. This was the quarter-final second and a decisive match in terms of the collisions. Sa's side's goal was a crucial match in the standings.
The final goal was scored by Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half ended without a goal, in the second half, the Montreal team’s two midfielders, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, also found themselves in the opponent’s net.
Only Roger Levesque from Sounders managed to play the role of Matt Jordan.
Recall that in Friday’s first game, Impact suffered a 2:1 defeat from the Starfire Complex in Tucson, Seattle.
Impact is playing in the lead with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, who scored 3:1 in the first match from the Whitecaps, won 4:3 in the final, but the Whitecaps came in with a combined score of 5:4.
Impact is expected to meet with the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the matches are still to be announced today.
Di<0xC3><0xB3>héj - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadiens' favorite triad is set to be ready for the next season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led three great attacks, and eventually the Canadiens won 3:2 from penalties at Centre Bell last night.
Kostitsyn, the first number one star of the meeting scored a goal. Plekanec two, and Kovalev finished the match with a goal pass, which was the fourth win from the team’s six preparation matches.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the draw.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian player warned.
"I've got another game to make me feel really fit."
"He tried to get too much out of himself in the first three," said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he's happy with the outcome of the game.
He got a huge ovation.”
Charest's Northern Efforts
The Prime Minister has not ruled out that the election will begin this year.
As soon as the Liberal Party’s meeting ended, Jean Charest had already travelled to Jean-Talon, Quebec, yesterday, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left) broke up for victory in the midterm election to be held today.
"To re-establish our last great northern border": this ambitious long-term goal was defined by Jean Charest at yesterday's meeting of the Liberal Party in Lévis, Quebec. The speech was also enriched by visual elements, while the president tried to concentrate on the idea.
During his performance, behind his back, a series of images similar to the "Moulin <0xC3><0xA0> images" were projected.
Impressive footage of the three giant excavators followed each other: barriers to waterworks, mining, Quebec on "Google Maps", maps...
Such spectacular tools are often used during the election periods.
The head of the government, by the way, was not willing to guarantee that the election would not start in the fall this year, although he added that the time allocation was very tight.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth pillar of the "vision" of the Prime Minister's vision for the future of Quebec, which is embodied in a "new economic area". This is a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and more, a plan with Ontario.
The recent opening to the North (i.e., the area beginning at the 49th latitude) has often been featured in the speeches of the head of government, but has never held a lecture on this topic.
The head of state, however, only insisted that he explained why he would keep the North "a huge treasure trove of opportunities". However, he did not talk about the time factor, investment amounts, nor about a specific order of importance for the future project.
It highlighted only a few development opportunities: primarily hydropower plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, which is further fuelled by the growth of the countries in the lockdown and the reconstruction of state infrastructures.
It is located in the north "with nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamond" - said Charest.
This area, which is "twice as big as France", "is our area, the territory of Quebec.
It is not only with us, it is within us," the head of state said, stressing that he wanted to create a national founding myth.
He pointed out that the development of Quebec was largely determined by the relationship with the North: the gold mine in Abitibi, the Quebec designer’s work, the James Bay...
"This is ours, this is our future!" he added, after taking a stage break, he saw a huge map behind his back.
The North, which covers 70% of Quebec’s territory, also includes a portion of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded of itself, the head of government said in a press release.
"This is our historic resolution, which has been confirmed by every government.
There is a line that has not been agreed on for a long time, and if there is an opportunity, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government," he said.
On the other hand, "in the light of climate change, we need to rethink our view of the North", the head of government said, speaking about the Northwest Passage, which will be opened every year as a result of the melting of the Arctic ice.
In the opinion of the Head of Government, it is an important task to occupy the area in this new geopolitical environment.
And what about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec is paying special attention to them and that many of their benefits will come from the plan, especially for young people.
The two ministers belonging to the various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was the Hungarian envoy of the Parti Québécois) have already begun the agreement with about thirty local communities.
The Ministerial Committee led by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier also began its work, in which Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) also played an important role.
The head of government does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, “not necessarily a summit” where they “create a common vision”.
In other words, the development of the North would be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, integrated and at the same time environmentally friendly," he said.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as consistent with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Just like previous liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from the challenges.”
This was, by the way, one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s election to the party.
One of the decisions adopted suggests that the Beauharnois power plant be crossed by Adélard-Godbout.
“The politicians of our party, including the founder of Hydro-Québec, Godbout, Lesage, who carried out the peaceful revolution and the nationwide distribution of hydroelectric power plants, or Bourassa, known as the father of the James Bay, all knew how to forge the future,” she said.
In the press release, he cited another work - true, conservative - as well as John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister's program "Roads to the North" between 1957 and 1963.
With regard to the plan for the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, President Charest stressed that it plans to be put into operation by 2012.
"Let's keep this between us, but I plan to be there," he told his followers, and he accepted his statement with a loud applause.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote to be held in the fall of this year, which the law will allow.
He stressed, however, that the calendar is already full, as he undertook tasks at the Chinese meeting of the Federal Council and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The party meeting held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the Liberal President to express nationalist decisions, which were approved almost without thought. Here it is mainly about the "problems related to the constitution": the Liberal Party's following in particular the "declaration of the signatory of Quebec"
I would also like Quebec to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and those members would have the right to veto decisions made in Quebec.
The opposition, however, skeptically accepted the main points of the Northern Plan.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Paulina Marois, reintroduced the development policy of North Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the Liberal government that came to power in 2003 rejected the application of this policy.
If they had not done so, "we will take it much further today," said Marois, in agreement with Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure, who was the candidate for the Jean-Talon vote to be held today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government’s acceptance of the Northern Plan.
“What we want, however, is that it’s not just a play,” said Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who is returning from his freedom today.
Letters - A lost country
Vic Toews, Harper’s cabinet minister (meaning “justice” minister) took the courage last summer to call Louise Arbourt Canada’s “shame.”
So to deceive a woman who has fought for the truth all the time and deserves all our admiration - that tells a lot about the people around the Prime Minister and about himself, too, Stephen Harper.
So this is our government, which has failed to deliver its own citizens from Guantanamo concentration camp on a single basis from the Western countries concerned.
This is the government that absolutely does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager at the time of committing the crimes he committed.
This is the only government that, despite Canada’s signing of the Geneva Convention, has refused to speak out and let a child sneeze under inhumane conditions.
The only government that makes a puppet theater out of justice while investigating the crime of a defendant.
Let’s just remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are also demanding Omar Khadr’s return to Canada to take part in a fair trial in Canada.
And our government is looking at torture: it doesn’t matter to him that a young adult is spiritually completely destroyed now, and the many years of torture has probably sealed his fate for a lifetime.
Although we are not yet aware of this, at the moment our rights, our freedoms and our democracy are being destroyed. "Democracy": Harper is constantly chanting this word, which in his mouth sounds like a mere empty word.
The time has come when morality no longer exists: they can arbitrarily beat, torture and imprison any Canadian citizen, according to the comfort of the leader of a government that has been in a minority so far (and what can come after October 14th)?
Many voters believe that salvation can be found at a party that celebrates the Erény, the Law and the Order. They do not see that this government is at the feet of those values to which our country has been able to thank for its good news and dignity.
Dear Mr. Toews, it is a shame rather than a search elsewhere.
Opinion - The Orwellian Dictionary of Barrick Gold
A letter from Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of Canada’s Barrick Gold mine, was published in Le Devoir on September 17.
Following Orwelli’s takeover, Garver said that the world’s largest gold-producing company had sued three authors and a small-money publishing company for initiating such a “public debate.”
Although the judges are independent and impartial, their decision - especially in the face of defamation - is not based on the truth, but on the basis of the law.
It is not surprising that Garver has listened deeply to this fundamental difference.
For Barrick Gold, would it really be the best way for a public debate to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada will have to spend significant sums on defense and combat in an unequal battle where, on the other hand, there are almost inexhaustible resources in the mining industry.
In such an unequal struggle, by the way, they often use the tactic of destroying the alpaca and binding a friendly agreement, with which they not only silence the opponents, but even frighten those who would try to re-occupy them.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he would have had to express his views in front of the public.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold is active, this is done in a different way, in Canada, the debating parties usually don’t kick each other’s but rather tell their thoughts.
Therefore, it would have been sufficient for the mine to open its books and dossiers and prepare for a real debate in the press, in the media, in publications, paying for independent research groups that could shed light on the issue.
But it seems that Barrick Gold does not trust the public opinion, and with a move he misreads the claims and letters written in defense of the authors of Noir Canada.
Mr. Garver could perhaps explain how he could initiate a "public" debate if, at the same time, he did not take the opinion of this public into account.
In the Vice-President's mind, this word probably means only the lawyers who have been paid for busily, not the integrity of Canada: the meaning of the term is thus well narrowed down.
In a democratic state, freedom of speech is also a matter of discretion for others.
Barrick Gold, however, doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – that Noir Canada’s authors and publishers primarily support the public because it condemns the rough procedure of mining.
The public would be willing to listen to Barrick and make a judgment, but on the basis of civilised arguments, rather than a sentence for silence for many. (In connection with the term "public debate", Barrick Gold has recently been quoted as saying by Norick Gold.)
In addition to Garver’s surreal plots, Barrick Gold’s process is an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the cornerstones of every democratic society.
The procedure, as a whole, denies the right to citation of credible sources, to a dispute over facts and their interpretations, which form the basis of spiritual activities.
If, in a country like Canada, it is possible to study and discuss topics that are not liked by the world’s wealthy companies, who will take the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it could do so according to the scientific standards that Noir Canada authors apply.
You have a right to respond.
We have been able to handle debates, differences of opinion and conflicts in our academic circles for a long time.
Barrick Gold’s unthinking procedure shows well that, contrary to his claim, there is nothing favorable to continue an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the public debate institution in Canada. It is time for governments to finally implement measures that limit the legal procedures initiated for such abuse.
Wall Street Rescue Action - The Democrats and Republicans Agreed
The Bush administration and the leaders of the Republican and Democratic Congress finally agreed yesterday on the economic rescue action, which has been the largest-ever such plan since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan, aimed at curbing the financial crisis that has been on Wall Street for months, is yet to be approved by the two houses of Congress.
Key points of the plan: more effective control of the implementation by the representatives; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the envisaged state money; new provisions for the maintenance of the number of houses occupied due to the absence of payments; the right of inspection of the beneficiaries of the aid
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Nancy Pelosi, president of the U.S. House of Representatives and Judd Gregg, a Republican representative at the hearing yesterday, reported the good news a few minutes before midnight after the end of the two-day marathon.
“We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively in the markets,” said Henry Paulson, a representative of the Bush administration.
“We have done everything we can to save the real economy and the American people from the current crisis that is affecting Wall Street,” he said.
“The most important aspect is that if we don’t do this, then the shock, chaos and confusion in the daily lives of Americans will be huge,” said Republican Representative Judd Gregg.
The negotiations were accelerated in the last few hours, fearing that a further failure would have a detrimental effect on the mood of investors.
They gave themselves a deadline for the deal until the opening of the stock exchange this morning.
The two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations late showed a willingness to agree, however, they said, they are not happy that the situation has escalated to the end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama himself attributed the extension of the agreement to elements such as the preservation of the property or the payment of the heads of state-sponsored companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take some extraordinary steps because of other people’s irresponsibility, it’s not a very pleasant thing.
These steps, however, are necessary,” he said in an American television show.
And when John McCain asked his opponent on another channel if he would vote on the proposed plan, he said, "I want to know the details, but I hope so."
“What I’ve read in a big way is that it’s something that we all have to swallow and that we can move on with.
The opportunity to do nothing is simply unacceptable,” he said.
According to the $700 billion plan, taxpayers would buy from taxpayers’ money the two-fold demands of the U.S. financial institutions, some of their risky, unsold assets.
The plan was preceded by a crisis that lasted for 14 months, which was triggered by the escalation of the property lease. This led, first, to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgages) and then to the spread of other mortgages and mortgage mortgages (recovery)
The first draft of the agreement was unveiled by a group of Republican representatives last week.
It seems that we have been able to get rid of this bag ever since the Democrats agreed that certain "toxic" tools of companies in a difficult situation would be provided by the government rather than bought up.
In order for all members of Congress to be satisfied, a provision has also been included in the plan, which stipulates that if the government is to bear the losses under the program for five years, it may levy new taxes in order to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, for the first time, a $250 billion detail would be paid out; an additional $100 billion could be followed if the president deems it necessary.
The remaining $350 billion would have to be approved by the Congress with a further vote.
In exchange for the aid, Washington acquires a stake in the supported companies, through which it receives a dividend from the profits, and which it can sell after the crisis has subsided.
The Federal Government will have the option of delaying the seizure of property to cover the mortgages involved in the plan. In addition, it will eliminate the maximum value of leases and final leases payable to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
I would like the drafters of the plan to vote on the plan in the House of Representatives today, and on Wednesday the Senate.
Despite their efforts, however, they are still unsure whether the plan will be approved.
In fact, yesterday, statements against the plan were heard again and again among both Republicans and Democrats.
“It’s perfectly clear that Washington won’t hear your voice,” said Republican Scott Garrett, who is on the house’s finance committee.
“Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no one who would benefit the taxpayers.”
Brad Sherman, a Democrat who leads a small congressional group called the "sceptical faction", presents things differently, but he comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred excellent economists, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to ask Congress: don’t rush and thoroughly examine which path it chooses,” Sherman said in a statement.
In Europe, at the same time, it was once again understood that this is a world-wide crisis.
Following a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they are nationalizing a part of the Fortis banking group worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion (US$16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced it would not buy up its competitor on the verge of bankruptcy after it lost 2 million euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in exchange for the United States.
With 85,000 employees, Fortis is one of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurance companies.
"It's not wasted money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
“In return, we get voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly something that depositors and households are now highly appreciative of, that the situation promises to be uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of La Manche, the British government appears to be preparing to nationalize another bank, which has been torn apart by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all of Bradford and Bringley’s ongoing loans, out of which the real estate loans amount to <0xC2><0xA3>41 billion (US$75.5 billion).
The Spanish Santander Bank announced yesterday that they will buy up the British bank’s subsidiaries and customer base.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to be nationalized by the British government since the beginning of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to the Actor's Balloon
According to some, the eyes of beautiful owls were the main punch card, while others were the main weakness.
Have you ever gotten rid of the narcissistic American actor with a smile?
Yes, and no.
Thanks to his shyness, sensibility and innate talent, he also stood away from it from the sly style, which is the existence of the real great monsters of the art world.
But what a huge path he's taken!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer at the age of 83 on Friday from connecticut. He was one of the last icons of the American cinema era.
There was less monumental individuality than Brando, whom he likened, and who for a long time was considered a contestant on the film stage. He was, in his character, more restrained and unquestionably vulnerable, but he also proclaimed the destruction of freedom and dramatic conventions.
The mixing of the blood often comes from extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio to a German Jewish father and Hungarian-born mother.
The European roots have contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic forms of the American dream.
He didn't think too much about himself, which only increased his worth.
Because in it there was a fan of the concept of "self-made man" and of the warrior ideal broken in the Pacific War. In the early 1950s, at Yale University, he studied at the Academy of Drama and then at the Actor's Studio in New York City, before studying in the studio at the studio.
In addition to being a champion of civil rights, she reached second place in the Le Mans 24-hour race in 1979 as a car racer, and was considered a sex symbol, although she has been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we can never know what the shadows were in the life of this mysterious, closed-minded actor who hated the star of the show business. This remains a mystery forever.
He was an honest man, in the best sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s death at the end of the week shocked the fans of motion: in his big role, he can only be seen on the black screen of memories.
Looking through his life’s work, the seventh American art has been taking place in front of us for more than fifty years, with continuous changes in the cinema.
In our memory, the charming cowboy "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) is mixed with his sensitive wife (Elizabeth Taylor), a young man whose role can be seen in the 1958 Tennessee Williams film "Macska on the Hot Badge."
From recent times (1990), we can recall the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who, in his old age, faced with the fact that his marriage did not change his hopes.
In addition, Paul Newman has seen many other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise's film "Somebody's Gone", the invincible crime-boxer Rocky Graziano played an unforgettable role. This role was originally intended for James Dean - and taken over after his death - in Newman's 19-year career.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant work "The Big Left", which won an Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
In Robert Rossen's 1961 Genius film "The Swindler", he was cast as an avid billionaire, and in a similar role returned in Martin Scorsese's 1987 film "The Color of Money".
Times change, but the face is always the same: it was him.
That's always been the case.
The period of his career was marked by a change in eras of metal.
The younger is best known for his cult film "Icebreakers" by George Roy Hill (1977), where he trains Reggie Dunlop, a team of ice-crackers who don't work with the usual methods.
Fans of "The Big Jump" were seen by the Coen brothers in 1994.
Sam Mendes' 2003 film The Road to Harassment was the last one to appear in the role of an Irish mafia boss.
Unlike many film legends who left the film scene relatively quickly, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, though he condemned Hollywood with its glittering, illuminating, and impersonating.
French film director Bertrand Tavernier did not consider it without all the humor as a "living nightmare of underplay": his play was too powerful.
The profession, however, was not always kind to the handsome Paul Newman, who for a long time had only fallen into the lap of the film's characters.
Yet, he played young and successful characters more rarely: rather, he formed figures living on the periphery of society – nervous, alcoholic, malnourished, or hopeless – to whom he was able to restore his maturity and rebellion with perfect credibility.
As a director, Newman showed a less well-known face: a truly attentive and sensitive person in the depths of his soul.
With his wife, Joanne Woodward, in the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (adapted by Canadian writer Margaret Laurence), she painted a fine portrait of a melancholy woman in the lead role.
The 1984 film "Harry and the Son" reminds Scott of his son, Scott, who died in drug overdoses, of reluctance and sadness.
Yesterday, Newman's numerous admirers remembered the actor. His close friend and old fighter friend, Robert Redford (with whom they played together in "The Big Left" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") stated:"His life was better
Pride and joy of being: it was the secret to the vibrant individuality of this great actor that we have just lost.
In addition to his legendary career, he is oblivious to his remarks about civil rights, the environment, the struggle for independent filmmaking, and Hollywood’s ouster.
We could often see her picture smiling at the packaging of cakes, sauces, biscuits and other foods. She did it with a bad toothpaste, although at the beginning she thought it was still funny.
However, the income from such sales has always been referred to as the foundation created for children suffering from the disease.
Newman never sat on his lap: he remained committed to the profession for so long.
In his letter to his five daughters, he wrote: "Your father was always and always inconceivably grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here.”
It is also a privilege for us to experience the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model, above all else.
What was produced in Zuschlag & Tsai?
Soon, on 8 October, the trial of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his associates are accused, in particular, of fraud, which has been continuously and commercially committed in a criminal organization, and of other crimes, including forgery and embezzlement.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the winning bids were used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often verified by false accounts.
The state and municipal funds – totalling about 65 million HUF – were partly in the Young Left’s treasury, partly in the pockets of some people.
The method also described by the investigating authority was that the winning tenders were drawn up on the basis of cost accounts, which were not real performance, and the associations were never satisfied with the undertaking.
Allegedly, most of the accounts were fake.
These were purchased in the market in J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros, and the circuit breakers were manufactured in Kiskunhala.
And to which of the companies in the name of the account production, among other things, he fell on the Balaton circuit to which J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag sent Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados.
According to his last testimony, he had to look at pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an account of his consumption there, which was then sampled by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Social and Labour Council, and the Municipal Government’s bids, among other things.
Most of these were noted by Lados Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n with his partner, <0xC5><0x90>ri Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s, who, according to our information, wrote the most necessary reports to win the grants.
One of the highlights of Lados' "study trip" was a brewery.
According to two accounts published by Zuschlagek in 2003, the guesthouse provided the meals of the nine main groups of the Bestos Pont Association.
However, according to the head of the company, they could not have entered the restaurant at the same time.
Likewise, for the Better Future - later together with the Third Millennium - the account of the Foundation issued in the summer of 2002 was shaken by formal and substantive errors.
There were only three rooms in a bed and breakfast, more than ten people could not believe it in one night, and the bill was still about one hundred and thirty guests.
But the fanciful print-fillers came to the fore even when they marked Pigal Kft., which also deals with hospitality, in whose accounting - according to the information given to the prosecution - did not even include the word for Better Future and Hope.
The head of the company, Farkas Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91>, told hvg.hu that when he was called to the prosecutor’s office and showed him the bills, he knew immediately that they were fake documents.
"Our company's name and debt were in the wrong place on the label."
He added: For formal reasons, he did not agree that hundreds of people were accommodated according to the bill, because they have a total of eleven rooms, in which there are not so many beds.
In addition, the account was also meant for catering, while their restaurant no longer works for a long time.
The invigorating account holders did not follow the fact that their Budapest travel office only organizes foreign trips, so they marked travel in Hungary as a service on the cash payment account, which also did not agree with the company’s account release time.
In addition, as revealed in the investigation, the VAT was also included in the document, although the travel activity to countries outside the European Union was tax-free.
Among others, the amount of VAT was also incorrect in four documents issued by Hotel Révf<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xB6>p Ltd. for the Better Future, because the company’s service is not subject to the 25th VAT, but 15 per cent VAT, as well as the employees of the hotel were only issued with a machine invoice.
In addition, the “exhibitors” also failed to identify road freight in the case of a company as an activity carried out - it was revealed through the prosecution procedure - which the company, which was originally based on investment advice, did not continue.
In addition, due to differences in form – not an appropriate account format, not a true marker – it failed to show that the accounts for the Third Millennium Foundation, the 21st Century Cultural Association and the Secured Point are fake.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehert<0xC3><0xB3>, whose representatives refused to issue the bills.
The counterfeiters did not pay attention, for example, to the fact that HIB Kft. of <0xC3><0x9A>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>zi was under a census at the time (2001), when the group of the Association for Young Cities was eating there, which is why the company's census officer - according to our knowledge - was denied.
Consciously Exposed
The other group of account issuers are those who were aware that they had to issue a fictitious account.
The Esely Budapest Foundation has set up an account at the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists for the Foundation for the Third Millennium, for about four million HUF.
The head of Collab Ltd., according to the indictment, was hired by one of the defendants, Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rfi Ludovic, to issue the fictitious account.
He also cooperated with Zuschlagé, the Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation, which in 2003 saw the Foundation for Better Future, the Atlas Association and the Red Cross Association with roughly 5 million HUF in outstanding assets.
It’s not a money move, either, because they’ve been hacked after the completed accounts, but organizations have forgotten to include this in their documents.
The following group of companies issuing the invoices belong to those that can be linked to the defendants.
Thus, Kubatov Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n, the delivery officer of the Ukrainian manager of Delta Trio Kft., was based in Budapest, dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles.
The company also issued several accounts in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computing devices, worth around HUF 18 million.
According to the data of the investigation, these accounts have been purchased by Cash Investment Kft., which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
This company was run by a Romanian man, who was also to whom Kubatov Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n would have forwarded the company-related documents between 2002 and 2005.
We know that Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he had issued an invoice on behalf of the Kft. to the Atlas, Hoppa and the Joint Foundation for the Third Millennium, and he took up their contraindications.
At the request of Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov, Romanian stone builders founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, in fact, none of the companies worked, which the defendant claimed was the reason they did not get a job.
However, he took advantage of the companies because, at the request of his co-defendant and lawyer Szente Zsolt, who also made the documents of the company’s foundations, he set up accounts on behalf of the companies for the Zuschlag-related associations: Atlas and the Y-Generation.
In the name of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave a total of 15 accounts to the organizations, worth HUF 14.2 million.
Prosecutors said 10 percent of the amounts in the accounts and that the tax hit Kubatov's mark.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictitious bills, these were produced for the bid of the Bestos Pont.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation and the Association for Modern Hungary submitted an application to the public service organisation of the Socialist Party, the T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500-500 thousand HUF, but the amounts were not converted to the targets indicated in the tender.
To avoid this, five fictitious accounts received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
These accounts were found, by the way, during a house survey in the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei in his educational portfolio.
At the trial, a part of the defendants, as they did in the prosecutor’s office, are likely to report on the course of the accounting process.
The most interesting thing may be that if you are the primary defendant, J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag decides that everything excites the veil.
His testimony so far is not too detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether this is in the interest of the majority of the damage, fifty million HUF in the head of the reparations, was committed by the socialists, and Zusi takes the left.
Those who, by the way, may have been offended even now, because, in order to alleviate their circumstances, i.e. to put them under house arrest, have constantly found themselves deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of far greater harm and non-returning economic crimes can walk freely, or at least wait in their own homes for the end of the ongoing proceedings against them, there is no way for them to do so.
The Psychology of Over-Citation: Why Do We Give Out More Money?
On pricing, buyers tend to spend more money, overestimate the goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known — and seemingly irrational — behavior have been revealed to New York University neurologists and economists.
According to a study published in the journal Science, people don’t want to compete in a type of competition, such as eBay auctioning, so they’re paying too high a price.
The research tried to map the nervous system diagram of this "play" with the help of experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers participated in the lottery and the other group participated in the player auction, while using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method, they examined the active brain areas of the experimental subjects.
In both games, the participants could win money, but during the auction game - in which an important element is the overstatement of the other side - a complex called striatum, under the chin, became intensively operational when the game was lost.
This brain area plays a role in the mechanism of the nervous system's "recognition" in addition to several other functions.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price increase can be explained by avoiding the severe reaction of striatum.
To support their theory, the members of the research group of economists also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In these three groups, they bid against one partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product concerned and they made their bets.
Another group has also been promised that if they get out of the game, they will get another $15 in rewards.
The third group, however, received just $15 before the auction, but in the event of a losing auction, the money was also lost.
The difference between the two groups was therefore only so much that for one of them the gain was emphasized, for the other the loss was emphasized.
However, by proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team playing "against loss" were willing to bet higher than the control and "power" group.
“These results cannot be derived from the theory of any economy that has existed before.
So far, they have only explained the phenomena that can be experienced in the auction with the joy of winning and the avoidance of risk.
Only the neurological imaging methods have helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories by reaching a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, among the leading causes of death, chronic liver disease is mentioned.
There are hundreds of thousands of people infected with hepatitis at home, but only seven thousand are treated for this reason: patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a collection of infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
Their tonsils have many similarities, characteristic of inflammation of the liver and yellowness, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food chain (e.g., food contaminated, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (inflammation, swelling).
Travelers are definitely worth protecting against the A and B virus, there is no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis A symptoms occur two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, usually accompanied by a bad feeling, weakness, abdominal complaint, nausea.
After this, yellowness appears on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the stool becomes a light, the urine becomes a dark color, the healing can last for two to three weeks.
Every year, one million people worldwide die of the most serious type of the disease, caused by hepatitis B in the liver and liver.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people will receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to hepatic insufficiency and liver failure.
Most infected people do not even know about his illness, because the pathogen destroys the liver cells subtly, in many cases the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
Thus, then, it is very important to carry out early prevention, regular filtering tests.
In three groups, there are far more than average cases of this disease: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users, and tattoos.
The number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus in the world is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease can already be demonstrated by a routine laboratory examination, it is worth going to the GP when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
In time, the disease can be cured, the virus can be removed from the body, so that the ability to infect and the development of cancer can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients around the world.
It aims to draw attention to the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by viruses, the causes of its formation and the importance of early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God, does it hurt less?
According to a recent study, religious faith acts as a kind of pain reliever, which could have already made it easier for Catholic martyrs to die.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how God’s faith affects people’s sense of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
During the rather bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and the same atheists were involved in electroshocks, while all of them were studying a painting depicting a Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out most of the pain.
Thanks to the technique of suppressing the human brain, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The study is the first in a research series in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers, and theologians also participate from different parts of the university.
The study was carried out precisely by strengthening a sparking device to the left hand of the experimenter, who supplied the electrodes.
The researchers asked participants in the experiment to look closely at two paintings, the painting of the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century with the Lady Hermelin.
The authors of the study hoped that the vision of the Virgin Mary would give rise to a kind of religious status among the faithful, while the image of da Vinci was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and was thought to have a calming effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electrodes in four consecutive parts, while either the religious subject or the general picture was viewed.
The Catholics reported that during the vision of the Virgin Mary they felt "safe", as if they were "watched" and "rested, peace filled them".
While viewing the religious-themed image, they reported 12 percent less pain than when they saw Leonardo’s creation before them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself participated in the study, thinks that a similar effect can be achieved with any strong effect image, even among atheists, only the right photo should be found.
“We should find a picture that they feel very positive about as a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
In English, Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should, and in many cases, change our personality," Wright said.
After the great results, the only question is, if Leonardo, or a similar-caliber painter, were to show the image of a Madonna to the faithful, what effect would it have on their pain management?
Would the vision of the quality Virgin Mary be even better?
You are what you share about yourself
On your tenth birthday, Google can tell you that people’s pockets are at least as big as the sky above their heads; you know where they’ve been vacationing, what they’re on vacation, and what they’re interested in.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's chief executives.
However, as far as skeptics are concerned, they don’t see the very essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal data about their users, and this is necessary in order for them to be able to adhere to the original purpose of Google’s founders’ information, which was to “get their world system together!”
According to the Google controller, the company is still in the early stages of managing all the information even after ten years of global outreach.
Asked what would happen in five years’ time, Schmidt said: “Would you like Google not to be able to answer questions like ‘what am I going to do tomorrow?’ or ‘what kind of work is really appropriate for me?’ – but until then, software will not be able to respond to such a simple one.
Not all internet users are aware of the fact that search terms are accurately recorded during internet searches, what IP address they were looking for and what page they were looking for after the search.
Our Personalized Search, launched two years ago, allows users to save their own browsing history, see what they have searched for, click on it, and, in the long run, they will not be able to log on to their custom search results.
What if they use my data against me, if they look at what I’m doing? – asks users who are worried about seeing Google’s data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company can be frightening, not your guilt, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or even the rebellion against the power to replace the counter-reactions in internet browsers.
However, the fact is confirmed that all the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases they can also be passed on to third parties, in such legal cases the personal rights of internet users are not protected at all.
Perhaps the most eloquent example of this in recent times has been the concerted action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information about the pedophile-related community site Orkut, which it maintains.
Interneters concerned about personal rights, however, were able to launch information in May, when the company successfully demonstrated its truth in court against the FBI: according to them, Google could not be forced to do so at a later date, even if it was forced to do so by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully fought out about fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it has obtained by linking to confirm the child protection law that had been passed years earlier, but has not managed to gain access to the individual search engine.)
So it’s quite contradictory to Google’s assessment: those who think they’re giving their personal data are being bullied because they feel their intimate sphere and privacy are collapsing by starting to use Google’s services, and they’re being bullied by a bunch of companies that are out there in the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the culture of American geeks and its many countries, which are enthusiastic computer fans, activists, and users alike, sees the next generation of big companies, the "going corporation" in them, as a rival to all of them, as opposed to the world of Windows.
This may be because, unlike Microsoft, Google doesn’t ask users for identification code, it doesn’t ask for money for its applications, and the open, free, constantly kept source code and program package is much more accessible, younger, cooler and more effective.
However, it may also happen that the geeks accurately review the relationship between personal rights and the Internet is very problematic, which is precisely one of the most frequently cited keywords of recent years, the web 2.0 train itself.
Web 2.0 is nothing more than collaboration, it is about deliberately leaving traces behind and exploiting the communication channels available to us, and while the extent of these changes individually, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
An average young person can also run a profile on multiple social sites from Facebook to Shanghai, you can link them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm listing their music habits, then you can link them all to a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Flicken.
While we can read about a number of examples from which it is revealed: a friend would easily find out about his morning photo shoot of a shared circle of friends, that a family friend with whom he spent the night or could fire a company employee just because he thinks he is a blogger, because he thinks that
The person who lives an online life consists of what he shows from himself, by this we can describe the basic premise behind the behavior of today’s young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to avoid the Google monopoly, can do it (for example, using Google’s search engine, but at the same time deliberately not leaving a trace with Scroogle).
For example, the number of people who are unwilling to register for social networking sites in order not to be able to access them, the online applications of Google from the text editor to the image manager and the news reader can be replaced with alternative versions that are not linked to our site.
Public opinion isn’t so secretive when it comes to showing off the whites of your teeth.
The company’s current value of $156 billion is not more than IBM’s ($140 billion), Intel’s ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola’s ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms are the main sources of revenue for advertising agencies.
The critical observers, however, found that there were some negatives to the sedatives, and that the top management, for example, completely refused to protest the employees, after double the cost of the company's nursing, the company found that the sedatives were too expensive to apply
One of the internal rules of the company is that they may not announce a new service in advance, but they will only be able to make use of it, but the sure, visible problems of the coming months and years will move the world in such a way: while some people will think that it is a project and that Google will be able to
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database can provide a good foundation for the next generation of sci-fi writers, a novel by the popular Cory Doctorow, with Scroogled Point Orwelli calls for a future in which a person can only get away with a good deal of Google data.
Two young men helped the <0xC3><0x93>zd double killer in the extortion
Two youths were interviewed by the police in the case of the double murder in Ozd, who allegedly helped to remove traces of the crime, said a spokesman for the police headquarters in Borsod County on Tuesday.
Young people have confessed to the crimes against them, and are currently being charged with a felony.
The two young men, according to the MTI, are free to defend themselves.
The offence may also be punishable by imprisonment of up to 5 years.
The suspect in the two Ozd murders, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
Premeditated, for profit, charged with the crime of murdering several people.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old belonged to a 53-year-old man with a larger sum.
The suspect did not want to settle his debts, so he smuggled his creditor to a settlement in Ozd on Wednesday, where he ended up with him and the man’s 9-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI information, the young man was prepared to commit the crime in advance, a sign of this is that he committed the murder with a weapon on the spot.
The circumstances of the use of the weapon and its use are examined by the police.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100 percent stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer, despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously banned by the Czechs from any new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in state hands.
99 per cent of the shares are held by the Polish state, which wants to sell more than 60 per cent of the papers in the course of a few months.
The E15 Czech Economic Journal is new to the knowledge that the offer of the Poles represents the highest amount offered by the interested parties for the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech papers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche B<0xC3><0xB6>rse have so far offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange last week said that among those interested in the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner, and did not conclude that in the future the Prague Stock Exchange could be eliminated.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated at 5-10 billion kroner by market experts.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, about 90 percent of the papers could be sold.
The largest shareholder in the Prague Stock Exchange, Patria Finance, is followed by an investment bank of approximately 25 percent, Cesk<0xC3><0xA1> Sporitelna bank 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13,5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the perspective of the European sheets
In their comments on Tuesday, which are devoted to the deepening international financial crisis, European newspapers have already referred to "the second of September 11".
We thank the President of the United States for the global financial disaster - accused La Repubblica of Rome - the President has not yet been able to organize his own party in the wake of a bill that was drafted in the wake of today's woes, aimed at the desperate medical situation.
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, mentioned by Warren Buffett’s billionaire investor, it is more appropriate to talk about September 11th.
Part of the press in Madrid sees the crime scene in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there put the world economy on the brink of collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is growing, and then the whole world will suffer.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but after a congressional vote, there was a threat that Washington would not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
The threat can no longer be ignored - according to the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still provide a lifeline for the underprivileged financial institutions, and with taxpayers’ money they can save them from the bankruptcy.
But if more banks die off like dominoes, then neither the funds nor any more instant payments will be enough.
In the long run, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to override their national self-determination and to centralise control over the fragmented money markets.
More than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion was received on Monday alone from the weakening financial institutions – recalls the Vienna Der Standard, according to which they are increasingly realistic about the concerns that, like the Americans, European taxpayers need to get deep into their pockets in order to get their money into their wallets.
So far, the EU has not taken seriously the crisis, which as a tsunami sweeps through the old continent.
The "refugees" do not have to shell out nearly a hundred billion euros, but it would be good if I recorded it: in which case it would be reasonable to reach taxpayers' money to prevent further damage.
The flight of the Dongo is imitated by the intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop technologies that are suitable for avoiding collisions if not the imitation of obstacles in the world of nature?
The bees, for example.
In the surprise project presented at CEETEC in Japan, the Dongo bees gave the strategic idea to Nissan engineers to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a BR23C-type, bioengineered car robot control system, a robotic mini-car that has been equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate goal of helping to design a system that will help to prevent the formation of a bee.
During the flight, each bee forms its own oval-shaped personal space, which is in fact very similar to our safety protection cages, explained Kazuhhiro Doi, technology PR and research and development brand director at the exhibition.
An important role is played by the complex eye of the bee, which is able to see in all directions at a viewing angle of more than 300 degrees.
In order to print out the function of the complex eye, the engineers came up with the idea of a laser rangefinder.
This 180-degree field of view in front of the BR23C identifies the obstacles within a distance of 2 meters, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately forms an operation to avoid the collision.
During the fraction of a second, the obstacle is detected, then the autorobot, following the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction of the wheels to the extent necessary to avoid the collision.
In any way different from the current system, this avoidant maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If it wasn’t, the car robot wouldn’t be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and project at the car robot.
It needs to react in an intuitive way and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner layer of the security buffers, a layer within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does in order to get rid of other bees.
This process needs to be done in a blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, the deviation cannot be directed upwards, downwards or transversely, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibility available to the bees to avoid the other bees, only the rotational movement and acceleration, as well as the slowing, were used as the option available to the vehicle.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and higher in energy density, which means they have a longer lifespan than the lithium-ion variant.
According to Andoh, the instinctive intelligent response is the ability to process data, not the ability to store it even less.
This structure needs to process and respond to only a few input signals per second.
You don’t need to keep them and react with intuitive logic based on the data of previous manoeuvrings, so you constantly use only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
You don't need a gigabyte of memory, or you don't need a megabyte of memory.
This is the first step in the development of the technology for immediate avoidance, which, according to Nissan’s estimate, can be involved in series-production cars within ten years.
Another application option may be to integrate the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system in order to steer the car to the specified destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
It is also the name of a toxic child.
The written version has been prepared for the $700 billion economic bailout bill to be applied in more detail, aimed at buying bad loans from banks.
In the first round, half of the amount is spent.
According to Eastern Party time, during further talks after Saturday night's midnight, congressional leaders reached the threshold of a total of $700 billion in bailouts, a dispute that has been raging for days, Reuters reported.
“We have made tremendous progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said the deal is only on paper.
The compromise on the package was backed by both presidential nominees, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Speaking about the outcome of the compromise, Finance Minister Henry Paulson said that the programme will work and be effective, but further action is needed. Pelosi said it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the corner of the economy.
The written version of the package was made public before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday evening 8 (i.e. Monday morning two o'clock in Central European time), according to Washington time, but did not cause a spectacular upturn on the stock market.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote on the draft legislation, which will be named after the Economic Emergency Stabilization Act of 2008, and then the Senate will vote on the bill.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and then the White House welcomed the news of the agreement.
“We are pleased with the progress we have made at night and are greatly appreciative of the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our money markets and protect our economy,” said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
The program, by the way, differs from the original Bush administration proposal, which would have said that the $700 billion would have been transferred to one another to buy bad-quality, credit-worthy securities.
Now, in the first round, you can spend up to half of the $700 billion by using $250 billion immediately after Congress is expected to vote in the case on Monday, of which, the Treasury Department's credit-backed, misclassified securities will be bought at a rate of $100 million.
The program will be overseen by a separate body, including the President of the Federal Reserve.
Spending the other half of the 700 billion depends on the Congress’s new decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: you can buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage securities at the same time, as well as other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase can take place within the framework of auctions and directly - the ministry's authorities said.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program, where the financial institution guarantees the instruments that cause concern, for which the companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulson said: “The law provides the necessary tools to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it’s about buying a wide range of bad instruments, whether it’s insurance or a large sum of money.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready for the introduction of the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
However, the heads of the banks that have been in trouble and waiting for state aid can expect the government to limit their withdrawal money – which is simply called the offshore loop – to be a golden springboard.
To limit payments, it is only in certain cases, in addition, the limits depend on the way in which the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if the ministry buys as part of an auction, it will charge extra for the gold parachute unless it is sent to retirement for the banker who has been transferred.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that the driver’s money is not overstated.
The image is of the fact that the existing gold slip contracts do not change, the restriction only applies to new ones in order to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first time in U.S. history that there will be a legal restriction on the recommendation of CEOs, said Barney Frank, chairman of the House’s committee responsible for financial services.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the state gains the right to participate, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can also win in business as the economy and together with the bank saved stands on the ground.
The bill states that in the next five years, the president will have to submit a proposal to Congress, which has a way of reimbursing the expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector.
There were, of course, those on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That’s not what American citizens have asked us to do, that is, it doesn’t protect taxpayers’ dollars,” said California Republican Representative Darrell Issa.
A fellow Ohio Democrat, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were carried out by the same people who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise.
Industry domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, compared to 12.9 per cent in August 2007, according to KSH.
Compared to July 2008, the prices of industrial export sales were 1.1 per cent higher, down 3.9 per cent from the previous year.
As a result of domestic and export changes, industrial producer prices were 0.7 per cent higher than in the previous month, compared to 3.2 per cent a year earlier.
Compared to the previous month, domestic sales prices of the industry only increased by a minimum of 0.1 per cent.
The domestic sales prices of the processing industries have also risen slightly, by 0.1 per cent compared to July.
The largest increase in shadow in August 2008 was in the leather goods sector, in the footwear industry (2.8 per cent), mainly in the case of bag goods, sheepmeat production (4.6 per cent) and in the case of footwear production (2.5 per cent).
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials has resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical material, product production in the industry (1.6 per cent).
Price reduction occurred in the coal oil processing (1.4 per cent), the electric machine, the production of equipment (0.9 per cent), and - to a minimum - in the wood processing (0.1 per cent) sectors.
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the other processing industries, we measured a shadow growth of between 0.2% and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, which has a significant impact on domestic sales of industry, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to a fluctuating increase in official gas prices from 1 July.
In a twelve-month comparison - in terms of domestic sales of the processing industries - prices increased to the greatest extent in the oil and gas processing sector (32.4 per cent).
The production of metalworking products in the sector was 13.2 per cent, an increase of 11 per cent in the area of food, drink, tobacco production representing a decisive weight was observed.
The production of textiles, textiles (2.5 per cent) and electric machinery and equipment (0.3 per cent) have been reduced in the sectors.
In the other processing industries, the rate of price increase was between 0.6 per cent and 9.1 per cent.
In the entire processing industry, prices have increased by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors rose by 18.7 per cent year-on-year.
In domestic sales, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) was recorded in August in the sectors producing investment goods among the target groups of the sectors.
In the sectors producing consumer goods, prices have increased by 0.3 per cent, and in the sectors producing energy and further consumption, prices have not changed compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, the highest rate of rise was observed in the energy and re-use sectors (16.8 per cent) compared to the same month of the previous year.
In the sectors producing consumer goods, we measured a 6.8 per cent increase in shadow, a 1.4 per cent decrease in prices for investment goods.
The export prices of industrial forints rose by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, down by 3.9 per cent compared to 12 months.
Our domestic currency decreased by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro in one month, by 7.1 per cent compared to the dollar, by 7.5 per cent compared to the euro in August 2007 and by 15.9 per cent compared to the dollar.
Do I need a visa to travel to the United States next year?
G<0xC3><0xB6>ncz Kinga sees a good chance that the U.S.-Hungarian visa-free agreement will come into force around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian government.
In his opinion, “everything is now in good shape depending on whether the electronic entry or control system is being built in time across the sea.”
At the same time, he called attention to the fact that the new system will not have an entry permit, but tourists will have to register themselves before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy has been holding talks in Washington since today.
He meets with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom the Central Cross of the Order of the Republic of Hungary confers an award and talks with the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and Republican-designated foreign policy advisors John McCain.
Next to the bailout package is Barack Obama and McCain
Barack Obama and John McCain, both U.S. presidential nominees, secured the government’s $700 billion bailout package on Sunday, but there are politicians who are demanding the U.S. Treasury Secretary’s resignation.
Following the marathon talks held since the days of representatives of Congress and the administration, they announced on Sunday morning that they had entered into a principled agreement on the bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package aimed at eradicating the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Obama and McCain have shown themselves to be more capable of taking the country out of the economic crisis than a rival.
According to the most recent polls, by avoiding economic issues, Obama has once again gained some advantage, a clear advantage of McCain, which he gained after the Republican convention, with the nomination of Vice President Sarah Palin.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the bill on the $700 billion package would be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed, the proposal includes those consumer protection passports that he also supported.
“We must now act with responsibility ... your position, your savings, your entire industries, the stability of the entire economy is a threat,” he said.
He didn't forget to call McCain's economic ideas a thing of the past.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, “We’re all going to have a hard time swallowing this ... but doing it is simply not the way to go.”
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal included the establishment of the Committee on Supervision of the Minister of Finance and the restriction of the final satisfaction of the top executives, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role in the negotiations, but that he was in daily contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill as early as Monday.

The right-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp the voters have become more self-aware - so Der Spiegel analyzes the weak role of CSU in Bavaria.
I am prepared for the government of Austria to prevent the red-black coalition from taking place.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In an online edition of the German newspaper on the left, Franz Walter, the Bavarian revolution is unfolding in an article titled "The Causes of the Dramatic Defeat of CSU's Parents."
According to the well-known political scientist, CSU’s erosion began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
At the same time, the change of era is the problem of the whole Christian democracy, and so is the problem of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not quite surprising for CSU, but Sunday ended a process that was likely almost exactly ten years ago: the undisputed hegemony of a state party has ended.
It was ten years ago, in 1998, when CSU landed at 47.7 percent, the first time since the 1950s, below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so even in the mentioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consistent modernization carried out by the CSU in the province, which will unravel its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the rate they have made a big mistake. However, there could not have been any consequences for the loyalty of voters to CSU for secularization, educational results, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developing region of Bavaria.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this can also be seen.
The right-wing camp was untouched, only within the camp the voters became more self-aware, more critical, more self-conscious.
It is also evident that in recent weeks, the classical civic groups have moved away most from the CSU; they are free-lance workers, industrialists, graduates and senior citizens.
The CSU’s support has already shrunk by 40 per cent.

The article in the conservative Viennese newspaper "Who, with whom? The party leaders in the recaptured coalition issues" deals with a confused domestic political situation that emerged after the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the intervention of the SP<0xC3><0x96> within its territory.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The election took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public service television, party leaders hardly allowed a glimpse into their cards.
Werner Faymann, SP<0xC3><0x96> president, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that it is possible for the two parties to cooperate – in some provinces and in social partnership.
The question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - with the current <0xC3><0x96>VP president, as Chancellor - has left Faymann open.
As you mentioned, the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>ssel-Molterer course was taken anyway.
The repetition of this direction is not a question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, it will certainly not be effective to cooperate if Faymann tries to intervene in the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether the party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition, which is currently fully open in the party, the issues must be discussed within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
President J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider BZ<0xC3><0x96> has again shown himself to be open in all directions.
"To prevent the Red-Black coalition, we are ready to take on the responsibility of the government," Haider said.
Next Next post: The Devil’s Circle of Poverty, Segregation Must Be Broken
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which is the host of this year's French Presidency of the European Union, has begun in Paris.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, the Fidesz representative of the European People's Party, drew attention to the educational segregation in her message to the plenary as one of the main speakers of the professional consultation, because it is one of the most serious violations of the rights of Roma children.
The high-level conference, on behalf of the French Presidency, was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Vladimir Spidla.
Representatives of the governments, the European social partners and the most prominent European law-enforcement and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities were invited to participate in the consultation.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka - according to the press officer of the Fidesz EP group - warned that in addition to the discrimination that can be experienced in employment, the Roma are primarily forced out of the labour market due to their low schooling.
“The overwhelming majority of Roma youths do not have a middle-class degree, and as a result of poor quality primary education, only a small proportion of them can obtain a higher degree.”
He also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the representative, it is necessary to inform these associations in the widest circles - between Roma and not even between Roma.
For the sooner a Roman student starts school, the more likely they are to become productive members of the labour market; through taxes paid after income and consumption, they contribute to the national budget.
"The Roma should be entitled to their European citizenship as a European Union citizen and their right to quality education should be guaranteed and their low-quality and separate education should be recalculated," said L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
According to the representative, it is essential that the objective and action-oriented approach of the European Union be adopted in order to speed up the process of school segregation immediately, and that the correct observance of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
“We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, unemployment, and give Roma children the opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as a full citizen of the democratic space,” said J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
On the occasion of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which has been held annually since last year’s meeting in Berlin, aims to provide a unique forum for equality of opportunity at European and national level.
CSU: Grace for Transitional Time
At the end of October, they decide on the fate of the staged Huber-Beckstein duo
Despite the sharp electoral failure, heads have not yet died out, but discussions on personal issues have so far been postponed at the CSU summit in Bajor.
Erwin Huber, the party leader, and G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Beckstein, the provincial head of government, may still remain in place, a question of how long the grace will last.
An extraordinary party congress will decide on the fate of the tandem, which will suffer a catastrophic loss of 17 percent, on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the much-judged couple felt that they did not adhere to their chair with all their might.
They tried to dislodge the angry members of the faction and the base, who one day demanded personal consequences after the "bader tsunami" due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - true, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who is still at the top of his career - the Christian social union gained 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it ran to only 43.4 percent of its power.
For 46 years, the CSU has been a “single seller” in Bavaria, accounting for 18 percent of German GDP.
While the Conservatives continue to count high in the southern region, which is crucial for the Hungarian economy, they will be forced to form a coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of a reorganisation within the party, former Vice President and Federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer, who is a possible successor to Huber, will also be given a place in the narrow scouting team, which will be organized along the lines of the liberal FDP and the right-wing values.
It is a strange fate that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was exploited by Huber-Beckstein as a pair of gunpowder, came to the fore in the list of Free Voters, and was ruthlessly insulted by the large-scale municipal government.
CSU leaders are now turning all their energies into somehow stabilizing Beckstein.
In the transition, he will also take an active role in the so far, as Stoiber, who tied the strings from the background, called the 28th of September the worst day of the political career of the former provincial head and former CSU president.
Huber made a few quick remarks to the CDU on Monday, saying it would have earned much more support from the Brotherhood.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel as well.
Following the September 2009 Bundestag election, Merkel cannot be a chancellor if the CSU, which played a significant role in national success in 2005, is not somehow put to the test.
According to Merkel, who is disappointed by the failure, the loss of CSU’s ground will not be a negative blow to the Berlin coalition.
What is, of course, relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to deal with, and the crisis of the social democrats will continue.
The SPD achieved its weakest result in Bavaria with 18.6 percent since 1946.
Lukasenko resistance: 110-0
Not a single opposition MP has entered the Belarusian parliament in the wake of Sunday’s elections.
According to Russian observers, however, this can be explained by the well-being and stability of the country led by Aleksandar Lukasenko, according to the European Security and Cooperation Organization (ESC), by the irregularities in the counting of votes.
The EESZ, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Despite the fact that the legislature of the 10 million member states in the past decade has ignored the opposition, yesterday’s opposition, known as the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ), seriously hoped that after the amendment of the Constitution, the opposition would not be able to vote in the 2006 election.
The ODSZ also stood by the pre-eminent boycott.
Against the backdrop of the opposition’s expectations, Belarus, which has become increasingly dependent on Russia’s policies and policies, has taken credit for the constantly expensive Russian natural gas imports and has contributed to the inflow of gas pipelines through the country, including the inflow of oil and gas pipelines into the country.
He pointed out in advance to the relief that, when assessing the election campaign, the EBRD would prefer to focus on positive movements rather than on shortcomings - such as the rejection of the departure of a third of the opposition candidates -.
However, the EBU’s report on Monday has already ruled out the campaign – in which the opposition candidates could not, in essence, appear in the press – and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, there is a noticeable improvement in the political system: the political prisoners have been released from prison, and Minsk is also prone to a minor confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of the Armenian state of South Ossetia and the Abkhazia, which is part of Georgia.
"We have taken two steps forward, one step back, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Aleksandar Milinkevics told our newspaper.
According to the 2006 presidential election candidate, it is desirable that this should remain the case, despite the fact that "the power is afraid of allowing even an opposition to the weightless parliament".
The opposition does not plan to take offensive actions in view of the results, rather it tries to send a message about the need for economic reforms to the voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, we have to put obstacles in the way of dissemination, but I also see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly," Milinkevics said, referring to Luka's insistence that
"The question of time, due to the country's sales, the increase in the trade deficit, is the breakdown of social security that "provokes the silence of the cemetery," Milinkevics said.
In contrast to the opposition politician, the Russian observers described the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebeyev, who leads the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosztyi: “People do not believe in words, but acts”, so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "Breakfast only before working hours"
In the history of the Chigi Palace, rotary actuators have been installed in a unique way for the entry and exit of workers.
From this day on, this new measure will go into effect against the skilled workers, to filter out those who block and then go to drink a coffee during working hours.
The anti-solar news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and Mauro Masi, the Secretary General of the Prime Minister’s Office.
“The turnaround,” said Brunetta, “is aimed at better and more efficient work, reducing shortages, and increasing services.”
“A new, more responsible and transparent period is coming.
This is the real reform,” said Brunetta.
The installation of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, “the installation of the rotary cap is also important from a symbolic point of view.”
There was no resistance on the part of the employees - confirmed the Secretary-General: "The workers have corrected the measure, everyone has cooperated."
In short, the breakfast is over during the working hours, there is no more coffee and bryos.
Brunette smiles, advises, "A good little capuccino at seven o'clock in the morning is capable of miracles"
The College of Public Administration in Rome
In a statement, the minister said: “Within three months, 50 per cent of the public sector’s sick leave has been reduced, which means more work with 60,000 people in a year’s time.”
He also said that the Italian government should be made more effective.
“In the last 8-10 years, its wage dynamics have been twice the size of its private sector, and it has far exceeded its inflation rate,” he said.
At the same time, thousands of publicists gathered, joining a grant supported by the Italian Organisation for the Protection of the Environment and Consumer Protection, to protest against the provisions of the Brunetta Regulation.
“While the Minister of Public Administration is proud of the data supporting the reduction of deficiencies due to the disease, the ‘indecent sunspots’ force is constantly growing,” writes the Consumer Protection Association.
Across Italy, thousands of honest and hard-working administrative staff have gathered to report a breach of the illegal provisions of the Regulation."
The Regional Administrative Court shall, inter alia, attack the abolition of supplementary matriculation for diseases which can be traced back to the reasons for service, the extension of the stay of workers on sick leave at home, which may extend the period of stay in which they have been discharged, and may extend the period during which they have been discharged, in addition to the period during which they have been discharged.
Accidents at work: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything
In Italy, 2,500 workplace accidents occur every day, of which three are fatal and 27 are fatal.
According to the workplace accident insurance company, nearly 1,200 deaths occurred in the workplace in 2007.
The figures testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death today, and it requires almost twice as many victims as murder.
Today is the 58th time Anmil is organizing a day for victims of workplace accidents, traditionally held on the second Sunday of October, in all the provinces of Italy, to call attention to the problems of institutions, social organizations and mass communication.
"The worrying data provided by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, underscore that prevention of workplace accidents plays an extremely important role," said the President of the Republic of Italy, Giorgio Napolitano, in a statement to the company's CEO, Roberto Mercandelli.
The head of state has sincerely appreciated the "persistent commitment of the association to the protection of the interests of workers affected by the accident, the assistance of family members of the victims and the making of public opinion hostage".
“Natural and sincerely shared by everyone are the tragedies of this nature, of their size, and of the interest of the media and the public, but in reality we have to face dramatic, repeated cases every day,” he said.
Napolitano openly admits: "We are undoubtedly struggling with resource constraints, and the financing of education and information is crucial.
What is particularly important is the initiatives within the school, which are aimed at the direct enlightenment of young people who are on the verge of entering the world of work.
It is our duty to maintain an interest in the phenomenon, not to allow attention to be drawn to the social importance of the issue, as well as to more effective legislation that needs to be taken into account.
The president of the lower house, Gianfranco Fini, stressed on his part, “that the fatal accidents in the workplace are of grave social significance, which are of great importance to all of us, and that the institutions are required to do so as soon as they can.”
"The data on workplace accidents show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this nature is still remarkably high," said Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
“We don’t want this decreasing trend to be coupled with diminishing attention, because it’s precisely when the attention is lost that the greatest tragedies happen.”
“We believe that at the general level, we are still not doing everything we can to combat the phenomenon that could be solved through a complex action program.
In our view, stricter supervision and control would be needed – Mercandelli stressed – as well as more marked intervention in the field of labour-training, starting with school education.”
"More effort is needed to inform the public and make them a hostage," he added.
What is needed most, however, is a more responsible working environment in the face of a phenomenon that is a social problem.”
Mercandelli then condemned the “gradual deterioration of the network of compensation for victims of workplace accidents,” as well as the “assistance direction towards which the system has been drifting in recent years.”
“The goal, therefore, is to give back to the workers the security provided by the insurance, because the fate of the victims of the accident does not depend on where the legislators are willing and where the sharing measures are.”
MP3 Players May Be Harmful to Hearing
Persistent hearing loss can result in long-term and high-noise listening to portable players, such as MP3s, for example. <0xE2><0x80><0xA2>
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, the EU's Scientific Committee on New and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR), has published a professional opinion today.
“It turns out that 5-10 percent of those who listen to their portable music player for more than an hour a day for five years can suffer a lasting hearing loss,” the statement said.
“It’s a shame that young people who use loud and often loud portable music players and mobile phones are not aware that they can irreversibly damage their hearing,” said Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific studies indicate an indisputable risk, which we urgently need to respond to," he added.
The most important task is to inform consumers and to disseminate the widest range of information in this regard.
In the light of the above-mentioned expert opinion, we also need to examine the already existing control systems so that they can function effectively and keep up with the latest technologies.”
Brussels has asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the increase in the number of young people exposed to the proliferation of portable music players, as well as the disturbance they cause.
"Researchers confirm that we have a reason for concern, and the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and interested parties, is ready to examine what possible measures could be taken to address the concerns of portable players and similar devices," he said.
The European Safety Regulation currently in force in 100 dB sets a maximum noise level to be emitted by portable music players, however, increasing concern is accompanied by a risk of hearing loss resulting from the overuse of such data sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of the disturbance, through which the said hearing impairments can be significantly reduced.
In its expert opinion, the EU Scientific Committee states that in those who use the portable player device, who listen to music with a high volume (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week, the disturbance exceeds the maximum intensity of the noise in the workplace.
If someone listens to music for a long time under similar circumstances, after five years there is a risk of permanent hearing loss.
This affects about 5-10 percent of people using a portable device, which can mean 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno set up committee responsible for the future of the capital
Today begins, it lasts until March, the results can be expected in June.
This agenda was set out by the Municipal Government of the Capital for the work of a committee called "The Future of the Capital of Rome", which convened this morning in the new seat behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 committee members will draft the Rome directives.
After the end of March, the General Assembly and the Municipal Committee will evaluate the study and plans for the adoption of a capital strategy plan officially approved by the Municipal Government and Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"This is a completely independent committee in which it represents all kinds of political, social and cultural ideas - Alemanno stresses - and it is the task of developing proposals for the ideas of the development of Rome to which the political decision-makers, i.e. the Communist Party, have applied.
There is no question of incompatibility in power, we would have liked only a platform where great plans for the good of Rome could be born.
In March, after completing its work, the committee will split because it has a fixed-term mandate.
In June, we will present a strategic plan based on the work of the committee entitled "The future of the capital city of Rome" - said the mayor.
For those who consider the Commission's work unnecessary, noting that the professional opinion it has set up is not binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on what kind of work the Commission will do and what kind of proposals it will make.
If the standard proves to be appropriate, as in France, in the case of the Attali Commission, which I am sure of in the case of Rome, the contribution it has made will play an important role.
The power of politics often disintegrates in the management of daily affairs, as well as in the handling of emergencies that arise from time to time.
On the other hand, we are looking further, taking into account distant points of view, and planning for a longer term, and are committed to working towards the development and future of Rome."
The Mayor of Rome would like to point out that "this Commission is not considered a useless 'waterhead', because it is completely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a euro, but it will serve thoughtfully and in the minds of the most outstanding minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, “there is a need for an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that allows our city to jump the standard it needs so much to think about the future in a unified spirit.”
Regarding the future, to which the mayor of Rome emphasizes: "not only will it be limited to the current municipal framework, but it will look much further", we see in it not only the future metropolis and the status of the capital, but also the city of R<0xC4><0x93>p<0xC4><0x81><0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x81> and the city of R<0xC4><0x93>p<0xC4><0x81><0xC4><0x81><0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x81><0xC4><0xAB>, which is the city of R<0xC4><0x81>p<0xC4><0x81>t<0xC4><0x81>.
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known, self-proclaimed American politician wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, destroyed the American economy and formed close ties (as he does today as a private individual) with hostile Islam.
As the timing of the election approaches, the attacks on Obama are intensifying.
A Miami woman wrote on the Internet: “This man is full of ambition.
“Obama believes in a faceless way that he can gain the highest public-law dignity of a nation that has so far had two governors and five senators in total black.”
These attacks are in fact nothing to say; they are of course racist in nature, but they do not give an answer to the question of whether voters will be a good president. Then here are the public opinion polls: they indicate that Obama will win, even on a significant scale.
In this case, there are those who listen to their feelings and not their minds.
Inside the Southern States, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in its editorial: “We know well that in the ballot box the true American patriot will cast his vote.
The side of the American way of thinking appears here, which has remained hidden until the last moment.
“Just say what you want, and we’ll know where to put the ice cream, Obama or McCain.”
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they will leave the United States.
There have never been such words spoken until now, when the success of the black candidate can be almost certain.
However, despite all this intelligence, the winning weapon of the Democrats is George Bush himself.
1,500 people were asked what were the mistakes made during Bush’s time in office? 89 percent answered that Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and they put them in the bottom so that they could fly back home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans did not have to pack.
The majority, however, believe that Iraq was Bush’s weak point.
It's a huge task for the man who replaces George W.
USA: The economic downturn is already felt by journalists, the time for restrictions has come in the edits. Many people blame the Internet for the "death" of the printed press.
The PEW Research Institute asked 500 U.S. journalists how they feel about their professions in the future and about their intellectual power.
Well, at the moment, almost every journalist is pessimistic about his own future.
However, they did not clearly state that their concern for credibility would have been lessened.
They don’t feel as isolated as they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money.
We believe that the 2008 crisis is a failure of a weak economic model.
There are further serious problems with the newsroom, i.e. restrictions on the editing of the newspaper.
“If we don’t want traditional journalism, in the sense that the general public has achieved this, to narrow it down to a minimum, this problem needs to be solved,” they said.
Today, there is a very visible and complex pessimism in American journalism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior executives working in the press are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
At the local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior leadership positions.
Printed against an electronic press.
It’s not hard for the press to see where the world wide web is going.
The biggest publishers are paving the way for the Internet, which many consider to be the “murderer” of the printed press.
The "economic pressure" perceived by journalists has increased to 79 percent.
The 500-year-old journalist admitted that he is putting his voice to the side of the technology in the hope that it might be in the interest of journalism.
Today, in the U.S. press industry, there is a gap between editorial leaders, i.e. directors, and their working informants.
At the national level, 56 percent of leaders are confident that their whistleblowers will share their information with others, while at the local level, this rate can only be increased to 23 percent.
Some of this is related to the safe working environment.
At the national level, 47 percent of managers believe that they can lose their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this rate is 30 percent.
In America, the issue of "safe work" is constantly on the agenda at the team level (for our editors, ed.).
Only 13 percent of journalists have a contract.
In a nation of 300 million people in the U.S. where thousands of newspapers, newspapers, radio, television and Internet service providers work, employers usually offer as much as they want, so the thing works on a “glass or not” basis.
Directors usually get high pay, and editors can also earn tens of thousands of dollars a month, in addition to paying pensions and health insurance fees.
Freedom, on the other hand, works on a rather complex principle: in the first year x day, in the third also, until after a certain time it reaches a maximum of 15 days.
But U.S. journalists, according to their own admission, are often “diseased” during the year.
It all depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: ROMANIA BIROS<0xC3><0x81>G: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFERRATABAN MARAD
Carmelo Rinaudo, the president of the Second Criminal Division of the Court of Rome, rejected Danilo Coppola's request to move from his residence in Grottaferrata to a Roman apartment.
An investigation is underway against Coppola in the context of an investigation into the agreement on the exchange of shares between Unipol and BNL.
Last week, in the course of the procedure initiated against him, the house guards were dissolved and changed to a residence-abandoning ban on the Grottaferrata.
The lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, have requested that the real estate expert pass through to his apartment in the small rural town.
However, according to the court, these injections (in respect of which the prosecutor made a rejection proposal) would allow the company's cases to be affected and access to the evidence brought against it.
The elite is in danger.
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote on a $700 billion bailout package filed by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were more interested in, and still interested in, the punishment of Wall Street than wealth.
This is also supported by yesterday’s New York Times, which reports that the current crisis has led to a break-up within the Republican Party, which is showing an increasing division of the traditional, retaliatory, federal institutions and business circles in support of the U.S. and the U.S.
This guideline was published in a critical way during the vote of the House of Representatives referred to in the introduction.
However, the above event is only one of the significant changes that the economic restructuring that is still taking place indicates or allows it to be seen, and not only in the United States, but in the entire Western world, perhaps beyond that.
It seems that the crisis, even in the United States and Europe, only accelerates those phenomena that have been dormant for a long time, which are solidified in this new atmosphere and are finally brought to light.
The first such phenomenon is the return of the two-fold category of state sovereignty to public consciousness, a kind of re-establishment of the economy.
The crisis affects those banking and financial institutions, which, while maintaining close ties with the outside world, are, in the first place, and quite widely, fighting people and families who live in a single country, in a single country, in a single state.
This, however, represents a direct political challenge for those in government: how they respond to the difficulties and objections of those people, who are also voters.
So the crisis seems to be global in the economic sense, but in the political sense it is almost exclusively national.
It seems that political internationalism is essentially out of bounds: it is a precious proof of this that the European Union, which is unable to define a single political direction by way of comparison between different interests and national strategies.
So everyone from each national government is waiting for the intervention, the bailout package, the resurgence and the new rules, but most importantly the opening of the money tables: since in the emergency situation only the individual states have the economic resources to be able to make money, it is necessary to do so.
They also have the tools and the power to use them: under certain circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that no other market and no single international organisation will ever have to do to such an extent.
On the other hand, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on nationality is fully in line with the fact that economic growth in recent times has been a factor of increasing importance, which is closely linked to this element: this is the area.
In a paradoxical way, while we have been convinced that we have not already entered the net, we have become more sophisticated in the world of water technology, and we have been convinced that the global financial world is destined to dominate the world, once it has come to our senses.
From things that can be transported from one side of the planet to the other, they can still be completely connected to a place in the vicinity, to an area.
Thus, those who control the area have far more punch cards than those who were born in a place where there is no crop, there is no oil and there is no water.
I would also like to turn to the second novelty, which is a kind of breaking line of cells.
He who says that territory, state, government, necessarily also says: politics, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, it seems that the economic crisis produces two interrelated phenomena:
On the one hand, the recognition of the objective that there is a need for credible leadership, for those who can handle the events.
On the other hand, the current management, in particular the total loss of credit from economic leaders, has proved to be completely inappropriate and has proved that many are still ahead of them in the shadowy area.
Together, the two have an even deeper meaning and, in a certain sense, a more restorative sense: a sense of loss of credit, impatience, inadequacy and isolation, which in more and more Western countries is affecting the entire leadership elite.
It seems, therefore, that in the wider sphere of the population, there is a growing conviction that the time of the social elite at the top so far has passed. It has passed, even before their actions, their experiences, their way of life, their culture, their sense of the word complex, their sense of the word, their sense of the mind,
In other words, the demand for leadership, wrapped in the form of an all-encompassing, but strong delegitimization movement, feeds on the opposition to the ruling class and the traditional political system. This is not expected in the "religion" of the voters, or in recent times, the opposition to the opposition has shifted
It seems that the traditional elite, with its parties, with its programs, and even with its habits, with its press and its name meanings in the university, understand less and less, that is why it is able to represent less and less what has been done in the western society for a time.
In spite of all this, it would be an exaggeration to speak frankly of “the rebellion of the masses on the threshold.”
But walking with your eyes open is no harm at all.
We can walk with a super powerful glue on the wall
With the help of a super-powerful adhesive, defeat gravity and walk on the wall as a Spider-Man.
This goal has been set by several U.S. research centers, and a group of four institutions is nearing completion.
With a glue piece of just 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers managed to glue a 100-kilogram body to a vertical wall and keep it there.
The American journal Science has published the discoveries of some researchers from the University of Daytona, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the group of scientists was born from the development of previously existing, special, so-called carbon nanotube-structure materials.
“We need to imagine the principle of adhesive operation as a package of spaghetti-like pipe systems,” says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers covered the idea from the legs covered with gecko microscopic folds, which provides a perfect grip for the animal.
Tests with various materials, such as glass, teflon and sanding paper, have confirmed that the new adhesive is ten times more effective than the soles of the aforementioned pads, but at the same time "it is easy to peel off the wall" - explains Liming Dai, a craftsman of the day.
"This material can be useful as a temporary adhesive" - adds Liming Dai.
We can walk on the wall, just like Spider-Man? Maybe so, but researchers prefer to think of a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes conduct heat and electric current well.
You can find more applications in the field of space research.
Superheroes can still wait.
The University of California, Berkeley, also conducts experiments with a new adhesive material.
According to an article published in the American Chemical Society, scientists in California have introduced a adhesive made of a hair-like, microfiber material that goes through self-cleaning when moving on the surface, so it always ensures perfect adhesion.
Medicines? Fruits are forbidden!
Care should be taken with grapefruit, orange and apple.
These high vitamin-containing drinks, especially in the summer, which are popular for drying, if they are combined with certain life-saving drugs in the body, change their absorption, depending on the case, by strengthening or reducing their effects.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario at the University of London, called attention to the risks of co-administration of canned or fresh fruit juices and certain medicinal products. The American Chemical Society’s 236th annual meeting in Philadelphia was attended by:
Grapefruit has already been placed on the defendant’s path before, when it was found that some antibiotics, antihistamines, anti-anxiety, heart rate-regulating, and anti-inflammatory drugs can be considered toxic.
COCK<0xC3><0x81>ZATOS G<0xC3><0x93>GYGYZERE - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Pharmaceuticals published the news in its official publication, and warned doctors and patients to take the above-mentioned co-administration and co-administration seriously.
GRAPEFRUIT - According to the researchers, orange and apple also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of the drugs.
The list of active substances that prevent the absorption of grapefruit and other fruit juices could be long-listed.
Michele Carruba, professor of medicine at the Department of Medicine at the University of Milan, said: "These discoveries are usually immediately indicative of the different national and international medical institutions which are responsible for making them available to those who are interested in them, if necessary.
Therefore, you should always read the package leaflet of the drug you intend to take, and if something is not understood, do not allow yourself to be affected, but clearly ask your doctor or pharmacist," the Ansa Institute said in a statement.
Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics.
American Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, for his analysis of trade models and the territorial connections of economic activity.
Krugman, a 55-year-old neokeynesian, teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the Bush administration’s most vocal critics of economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman’s leadership, published in the New York Times, predicted that the latest event in the history of the United States would lead to even more devastating consequences.
This prediction sparked not only a few debates, but also in several tastes was put to the eyes of the economist, but today we know that it was accurate.
"I'm surprised and a little shocked at how quickly the public interest has gone through the disastrous collapse of Enron or Worldcom," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "stupidly valuable economist", but he is rather "aggressive in spreading criticisms of the Bush administration against excessive liberalism."
Open Office, third edition of the "Microsoft vs. Microsoft" package
Today, OpenOffice.org 3.0, an open-source suite of applications that aims to provide a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users as well as freelancers to the public administration, is released.
After the work of SUN Microsystem and volunteer developers for almost a year, the new Open Office will bring a number of new features to the general public: the welcome screen and the rethought-out, less-volunteer operating system.
Special attention has been paid to compatibility with Office 2007 so that Open Office can also open Microsoft documents with the new extension (.docx,.xlsx,.pptx).
Another interesting feature is the specific functionality of some modules, such as one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint slides. This can be useful when sending a file via email. Another function supports importing PDFs into the graphical module, by setting up the site.
We can also create hybrid PDF documents on this interface, which merges the typical Adobe format with the table manager or text editor elements.
In-app sharing has also gone through a number of developments: the table manager supports the shared use of workbooks, but prevents the improvement of each other's work. Each employee's comment can be marked with a different color, which is helpful for the control panel
Some companies are already working on making some of OpenOffice’s features available from the Internet (on the cloud, in the cloud), so the final version is likely to be introduced in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, after having appeared on the mirror pages since Friday, can be found at the following address: http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
The program package is also available for Linux in addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
On request, we can also transfer the installation CD to our home or workplace.
From the point of view of the spread of the home app, it’s likely that free is the biggest attraction, but the Open Office package is now trying to kick the ball in the business sector, as it can also count on a number of administrative and school projects.
There is no shortage of educational, advisory and service services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business horizons.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, Word-compliant text editor; Calc, Excel-substituting table manager; Impress, Powerpoint-based presentations; Dbase is similar to the most well-known, Access database manager; and finally, Draw the Graph.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, but if we consider that with the release of the new version we are already at 3,600,000, this figure is likely to be higher than expected.
Kohl's result is also positive, this is already the fourth doping case
At the last stage of the Tour de France, one of the participants, the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, who competed in the colours of the Gerolsteiner team, again produced a positive pattern, which won the best mountaineering jersey in addition to my bronzer.
The news was seen on the website of the Equipe Internet newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer, Italian Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepol, as well as German Gerolsteiner competitor Stefan Schumacher, who produced a positive result in the Cera test, which was considered the third generation version of the EPO.
Kohl's blood sample, similar to the tests carried out in recent weeks, has been studied in labs in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control tests also confirm the positive Cera result, the Austrians lose third place and are banned from the competition for two years according to the regulations.
Pierre Bordry, the head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, confirmed the positive results of Kohl’s third-generation EPO test, and told the Associated Press that he had reported the positive results to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrians were able to stand behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, as well as win the best mountaineering jersey.
BEV<0xC3><0x81>NDORL<0xC3><0x93>K: THE NEW YORK TIMES FINDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITALY?
From the country of Italian immigrants, it has only recently changed to one of the favourite destinations of immigrants who have been accepted as refugees.
That's why the "Belpaese" racist nation is being transformed? This question is being raised by the New York Times, which started from the case of young Burkina Faso's Abdul William Guibre - who was murdered in Milan last month because he stole a box of cookies - a long piece of racquet.
The case is well characterized by what the New York Times calls the "paradox of the north": in the northern regions the "strongest of integration and the highest of employment", while the "immigrant resistance and the support of the Northern League" is also the strongest.
The NYT also cites cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno in support of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants.
Oh, yeah.
The new laws required by the League, which would make it easier to expel illegal immigrants, have also been introduced as an example of a change in the mood in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic also pointed out this tendency: “Giorgio Napolitano XVI met with Benedict in the Quirinale Palace and assumed that the state and the Church would work together to defeat racism.”
Students suffer from expensive rental fees, up to 900 euros can cost a room
The housing market for university students is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by the Association of Home Renters, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already taken on such amazing dimensions that, because of the total cost of living for families, it is closing off a wide range of students from the possibility of learning," explains Laura Mariani, head of the school at Sunia's school, in a statement.
In most cases, real estate offers also contain a number of irregularities: contracts that are not registered, do not contain a rental fee, are linked to a lease.
According to Sunia, there is a need for an extraordinary measure which, through a review of the tax system, creates an opportunity to maximise prices.
The details of the survey show that in Milan, in the vicinity of Brianza, 450 euros will be requested for a bed; the price of a single room ranges from 650 euros (the area of Bande Nere) on average to 800 euros (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but the range of 900 euros (the area of Bande Nere).
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students live in the vicinity of the university, a bed costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>250/280 if it is double and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>370-500 if it is a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) around 600 euros are requested for a single and 450 for a double room.
With something cheaper (550 euros in a single room) the prices are around the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
Everything can be saved in the suburbs: 300 euros will be spent on a bed and 450 on a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, 300/450 euros are requested for a bed, 400 to 600 euros for a room. The shopping area of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei is the highest.
In Bari, you have to pay 250/350 euros for a bed and at least 350 euros for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are absolutely lower, but they represent a greater weight within the city’s budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students from outside the EU are often looking for accommodation, there is another problem: the rental fee demanded by foreign students is about 25-30 percent higher than for Italian tenants.
Goodbye good old Cinema Paradiso, in the cities sacrificed the time of old cinemas
Traditional cinemas are closed for the benefit of multiplexes.
"A city where there is no cinema, a blind city, like a face without eyes."
The images taken by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively show everything that happens in the Italian cities, but also in the rural regions.
The elimination of cinema - the appearance of a large, multi-dimensional cinema in foreign cities, and, as a result, the disintegration of single-products in urban centres - is an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time carries with it a true cultural sin for every sign.
When places full of history and memories disappear, "it is as if a friend of ours had gone away, a acquaintance with whom we shared our journey and many experiences" - says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which was nominated for an Oscar twenty years ago, was nominated for an Oscar, as well as the Cannes Film Festival
The largest association of operators, the data provided by the Anec speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas were closed. The biggest losses in the cinemas in the big cities could be recorded in 6 cinemas in Milan, in 9 cinemas in Florence, in 9 cinemas in Milan, in 9 cinemas in Milan, in 5 cinemas in 5 cinemas in the big cities.
Among the most affected regions, Emilia-Romagna is alive, which lost 82 one-time films, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And that the number of multiplexes in the last five years has increased by 195, and in the last five years, the number of cinemas in Lombardy has increased by 81, and in Italy, the number of cinemas in Lombardy has increased by 195, and in the last five years, the number of cinemas in Lombardy has increased by 195.
"The number of Italian units has increased irrationally," says Paolo Protti, president of Anec. "It is okay that we are building new facilities, but it should also ensure the survival of existing ones, because when a city cinema is closed, not all doors are closed.
Not to mention the unfilled financial funds intended to support operators: the state’s outstanding debt can be estimated at around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million.
From an ethical and moral point of view, it is shameful that the government does not comply with the laws in force.
It would require 16-18 million euros a year to maintain the market.”
The case of Bologna deserves special attention. This is the first Italian city, which, in its concern over the closures, decided to remedy the problem in order to protect and revitalize the city’s one-time cinema, through an agreement between the municipality and Anec.
The provisions would include the tax benefits granted to operators, as well as the benefits provided to the public to facilitate accessibility: viewers can enter restricted areas and park at a discounted rate in certain parking lots.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, even by introducing other measures, will follow the example of Bologna.
But it is also certain that traditional cinemas, in order to be able to take up the fight against the rule of multiplexes, need to improve sound and image quality, because today’s audience is much more demanding.
Protecting the traditional cinema has always been an important question for me: the closure of Supercinema in Bagheria - where I spent my childhood and youth - gave me the spark that eventually made Cinema Paradiso, even though I had studied it for 10 years.
I’ve been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the via Nazionale in front of closed Rialto or Quirinale to not see the blackened posters from the dust, I’d rather turn my head. I had so much experience here.”
Strict strands between politics and 'drangheta' arrested Mayor Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in municipal decisions".
Serious charges have been brought against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, the judges of the Calabrian Maffiaellenes Directorate, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, who was arrested this morning as a criminal.
Gioacchino Piromalli, a senior mediator between the clan and the administration, as well as a lawyer with the same name as the head, was also placed in the hands of a nephew of a lawyer who had previously been convicted of mafia-like crime and sentenced to 10 years in prison for involvement in a criminal conspiracy.
"The lack of any legal and moral rule, what's more to the taste of the good", the prosecutors write. The two local municipalities have declared their intention to pay a consultant fee to a lawyer from Piromalli.
"Thus, the clan would have officially entered the town hall, which would have provided further opportunity for the control and management of the administration, which can already be said to be significant.
Agazio Loiero, the president of the General Assembly of the Calabrian region, does not hide the fact that in the region "there are a number of interplays between local institutions and the organized underworld": There are areas where the proliferation of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere where the interplay is almost impossible.
However, many local politicians are resisting the pressure of ‘drangheta, they are the heroes who stay clean.’
The arrests this morning were a continuation of the July events, when police announced that they had managed to end the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were freed from their mandate to administer the municipality. The municipal committee of Gioia Tauro was dissolved once in 1991, even because of the alleged clashes between organized crime and the local municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian Democratic mayor at the time of the uprising, took the lead in the second round of the right-wing coalition in 2006.
He cried out to Botr<0xC3><0xA1>ny when the County Hall ordered the dissolution of the municipal committee.
Marco Minninit, the deputy interior minister, was summoned to court and accused him of planning everything for political purposes. However, the court, in its arrest warrant signed this morning, stated that he had dared to follow the Piromalli clan until his death.
In an interview with Dal Torrione, the state attorneys wrote, “it was a willingness to meet the demands of an extensive group of entrepreneurs who are known to be close to the Piromalli family, and the decisions of the local government to reach clandestine borders.”
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones come
An inexhaustible energy source that accounts for 70 percent of the planet’s surface, and which is only now discovered by major international energy companies.
Waves, sea currents, commodities, and a renewable energy source that has been watched by giants like Chevron, who are now trying to get their hands on it.
For hundreds of years they've been looking for the possibility of how to gain energy from the movements of the sea. In the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, research increased.
Around 1980, when the price of oil fell, the idea of using marine energy was ignored, but today the renewed rise in the demand for environmental protection and the price of oil gives the sector a new impetus.
According to the London World Energy Council (WEC) estimate in 2007, 15 per cent of the world’s electricity needs could be met by offshore wind turbines.
This amount is twice as much as what nuclear power plants are currently producing.
In addition, the currents and the current path would still be there.
The giants are in a hurry.
Enersis was the first company to commit itself to marine energy and in 2005 signed an agreement on a power plant to be established in northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary step when the signature was announced.
It’s been two years since then, and more and more companies are turning their backs on marine energy, including those who have so far been committed to traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying technologies that harness the energy of the oceans, and it is taking the opportunity to work with us seriously,” a spokesman for one of the U.S. oil giant’s associates told the Wall Street Journal.
The cooperation in question concerns the acquisition of the necessary authorisation to launch the Alaska project for the exploitation of marine energy issued by the US Energy Commission.
This is not a small issue, especially given the fact that the U.S. is currently in Alaska, and even President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power are also on the way to extract energy from the sea. The amounts invested so far, as far as you can know about the details, are evidence of growing interest.
The technology is waiting to be developed.
According to experts, this is still an initial technology, only because the energy from the sea does not reveal any doubts about the environmental impact.
Existing facilities, similar to those in Portugal or Scotland, are all small in size, so they do not cause too much trouble in terms of the ecosystem.
However, in order to be able to produce more energy, there is a need for facilities that have a more significant environmental impact.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a boiler system that is connected to each other.
The thrusts generated by the waves and moving the buoys upwards are converted into hydraulic pressure by the pistons and cylinders placed in them.
The pressure rotates a turbine, which feeds a generator.
The electric current reaches the dry land on cables that pull under the sea.
At the same time, there are four similar facilities in the design phase, which are only waiting for the federal license. Part of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
However, with the help of six offshore turbines located on the East River in New York City, Verdant Power has already started producing energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot.
During the flow, the movement of the water rotates the blades of the turbines, and this rotation feeds the generator.
Verdant stated that it has a long list of partners who are only waiting for the permissions needed to use the energy.
After the waves, there's a power outage.
Currently, differentiated attention is being given to the opportunities that can be exploited through the pipeline.
Although this is a periodic phenomenon, the current path is more predictable than the wind, the sun, or the waves, so it can be considered a more reliable energy source.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as the rest of the party state, spent $7.5 million in 2008, precisely to extract the energy provided by the pipeline. This amount is expected to increase to $35 million in 2009.
