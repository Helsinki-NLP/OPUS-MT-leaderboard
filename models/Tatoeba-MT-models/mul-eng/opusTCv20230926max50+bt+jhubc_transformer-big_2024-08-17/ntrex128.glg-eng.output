Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned about "taking them for monicreques"
Dismay among some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to as AM in English, for suggesting that they should change their name to MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate came as a result of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the whole panorama fear to be the object of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was concerned that the new name "would go with Twp and Pwp".
For those who didn't know Welsh, "twp" means "dumb" and "pwp" means "cock".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group kept an "open mind" about the name change, but noted that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal jump.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: “Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed great support for the designation of Parliament of Wales.
Regarding the AM title issue, the committee preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but MWP's option received a majority of support in a public consultation.
It seems that the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, who is expected to deliver the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules for disabling the AM and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what they should be called when debating legislation.
Macedonians join the ballots in referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday if their country's name is changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim of its territory and repeatedly opposed its requests to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the change of name, said he will take the case eight times from the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no longer at the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The camps of St. Martin remain silent as the churches of Harlem continue to struggle
“The elders I spoke to said that before there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Mr Adams said.
“Not one thing today or the other.”
He said he could understand that the bars would disappear.
“Now people socialize in other ways,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that people usually go to.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and “before or after they will return to where they started.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with full owner communities of the type of people who would not help the neighborhoods remain sanctuaries.
“The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore will accelerate the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of those churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation was built with the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, a commercial street in Harlem that resisted hiring and raising black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's friars made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly baptized the Carillon as "the camps of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also pointed out that it was the world’s first carillon played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who changed it to the largest carillon in Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place in St. Martin.
Those who have been occupying St. Martin for the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the church’s lay leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the body that governs the parish and that is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing its concern that the latter "pretends to affect the costs" to the council, although it did not participate in the hiring of the architects and contractors who sent it.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injures a boy while fishing lobsters in California
Police said a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while fishing for lobster in California on the first day of the crustacean season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he spent about half an hour diving with friends on Saturday morning when he listened to the boy asking for help crying, when he was swimming with a group of people to help get the water out.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just an emotion to fish a lobster, but he soon realized that he was yelling "I was done!
They worked for me!”
I had my clavicle snagged." Hammel said he stopped when the boy came in.
"Berreille to everyone coming out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was transferred by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press conference that they would split a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they determined it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to the upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablanca, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty runners similar to the two large warehouses full of expert assistants.
As part of the considerable immersion in the UK’s beauty market, which amounts to <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow as fashion sales and home products fall, the biggest beauty products brokers will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will soon move on to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets seek to fill the shelves that in their day occupied TVs, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's said it would double its range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive zones similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of boutique make-up so that most products are vegan-friendly, something increasingly demanded by the youngest customer.
In addition, the fragrance shop, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions at two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, South London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small stores implies that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive chairman of Sainsbury's, said the establishments will increasingly resemble shopping malls, as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat points of sale in hundreds of stores, since it bought the two chains two years ago. Therefore, this strengthened grocery sales and made the acquisitions profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute pharmacy revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds was said to be involved in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained personnel that you can go to for advice.
Our range of products is designed to suit all needs and attractive and practical locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old shopping habits.”
Peter Jones ‘crazy’ after Holly Willoughby retires from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business
The Dragons Den star, Peter Jones, has gone "crazy" after television presenter Holly Willoughby retired from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for her brand of home clothing and accessories Truly.
His company was compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, the 37-year-old actress used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones throwing sparks as he retired from his lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate that Jones was "crazy" when the golden girl on television admitted during a tense meeting held Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new businesses, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, meant that she no longer had time to devote to Truly's home and clothing brand.
The business was compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and it was forecast to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones picked up a plane to Britain and headed to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: “Trily was by contrast one of Holly’s priorities.
It would be your long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave has left all the people who participated in the project atoned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
Experts believe that the abandonment of this morning’s presenter is among Britain’s most profitable stars could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and home textiles, and that it could further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents to three children and have a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host on ITV's I'm a Celebrity show.
A source close to Jones said last night that "We shouldn't comment on your business matters."
A complicated conversation "and then we fall in love"
He joked with the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unlike a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump called him a “telephone presenter.”
“I didn’t give up anything.”
Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting held in June in Singapore, which Trump considers a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three weights after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see the “corresponding response” from the US to the first steps of disarmament Co-operation.
On the contrary, he stressed, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at further exerting pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
“Things with North Korea are going well,” he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have this excellent relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: ending missile tests, helping to free hostages and bringing the remaining U.S. soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this amphitheatre, we’d have about 200 people standing here,” Trump said.
An earthquake and tsunami devastate an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they will not seek international assistance, so it is a challenge," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether the foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Agency for Disaster Management, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could contribute with their help.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly enduring, the country is extremely ill-prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although shelters for tsunamis were built in Aceh, it is not uncommon to find them on other shores.
Although an alert was issued, the absence of a tsunami alert siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling between many of the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been docked in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake will make its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the new disaster to take place.
President Joko Widodo’s election campaign revolved around improving Indonesia’s deteriorating infrastructure, and raised money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a major lack of funding in the final straight to next year's re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a way of living the more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of clashes on the streets of Christian and Muslim gangs, who use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the goal of the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri being still about 27 meters from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He played the ball with his left leg before firing a shot at the second bat.
The ball flew over the area as it advanced towards the upper left corner of the net.
The ball ended up falling over a Kepa Arrizabalaga that jumped into the air and entered the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to organize ourselves, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to win as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came to Kante and din a touch without thinking too much and I just disappeared."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The frontman of the Blues passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning close to the half-change and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic built a wall in the center of the field.
He made a beautiful pass in depth driving Hazard towards the area.
Hazard overtook the defense and ended up in the second half scoring a shot with the left that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from Indonesia's tsunami rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the national disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped in the rubble of the buildings that came down with the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday and that caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to a press briefing by agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from the demolished buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation was opened this morning after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with white gun wounds on John Street, and arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
The police asked the people of the area to see or hear something from him one step further.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan stated: 'The investigation is in its early stages, but I'd like to make a call to get in touch with anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to capture anything with the camera of the control panel that comes in contact with us, as they could have key information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belonged to a neighbor of Birkenhead and that it was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she met that morning.
The investigation continues as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have informed him that they do not allow anyone to enter or exit the building.
The man was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just learned that they will not be able to enter again within a few hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There is a woman on the scene crying.
Not to say, “It’s horrible.”
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon guarding the apartment block.
To all who have information, please send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on the phone number 0800 555 111 citing registration 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle to "rewrite history"
His ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by his fanatical and puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "disparate" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure located outside the Palace of Westminster became a target.
The iconoclast of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed to Cromwell mistakenly for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the 19th-century opinion, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider still deserving of homage.
Mr. Goldsmith stated to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament under external pressure, in this case, of course, it was about monarchy.
Whether or not that is a complete representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the mid-17th century conflict defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.”
A Pork Killer Fucks a Chinese Farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
Last Sunday the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified solely by the surname, "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a fork in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A pig farmer prepares to put the vaccines to the pigs in a cage on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
She reportedly traveled with her cousin on Wednesday from nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave another adjoining tent.
He said there was a large male with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, of nearly 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he was killed.
“My cousin had bloodied and snagged legs,” the cousin, nicknamed “Wu,” told Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market director told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence on stage.
It seems that Yuan's family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are not very common, there have already been cases of pigs attacking humans previously.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-kilogram pig ran a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and surprised the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs don’t tend to be aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “shooter.”
"They're just playing.
They're like kids, they're very curious, they don't intend to do any harm.
You just have to have the respect you need,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring strong, widespread rains to the southwestern United States.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa weakens as it overwhelms the cold waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will carry torrential rains to northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. over the coming days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday, east time, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to advance north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a gulag begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward, toward the U.S. East Coast. As Rosa approaches the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northwards, which will penetrate the U.S. South.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical humidity with valdada will create abundant and widespread rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, precipitations of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The high tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain is expected, especially over much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
We strongly advise you to venture into the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
Strong rains could form cannons that could turn into floating rivers, and electric storms would bring locally cracked winds and dust.
The valley will bring locally strong rains to parts of California’s southern coast.
Total rainfall could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause a flow of minor debris and landslide roads.
These would be the first rains of the wet season in the region.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the last hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain extends into late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will reach the Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness large fluctuations in temperature in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this involves significant temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we will be able to see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the U.S.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm beginning of October is expected, with temperatures that will exceed 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high chances of temperatures above average for the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the trial of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate witnesses of the Supreme Court-appointed judge Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stagnation continues and the chains interrupt their usual schedule for a new last-minute Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he's 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had played them while he was drunk and tried to take his clothes off at a party at the institute.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that this would not happen.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company had a media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other broadcast chains, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen tends to have trouble measuring people who watch television from offices.
To get an idea, it is an audience similar to a football final or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with $3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, the interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on television.
After the moderate Republican office made a statement stating that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning and caught by protesters as he tried to enter a lift on the way to the hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He remained low-key for several minutes while being reprimanded, televised live on CNN.
“I’m here in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, “You have power while there are many helpless women.”
Flake said his office made a statement to Flake, before the elevator was closed, adding it would have more to say in the committee's hearing.
All television and cable networks broadcast live hours after the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate to submit the vote.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee next week, prompting a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Britain's prime minister accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and of harming the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the newspaper’s cover, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted on attacking May’s so-called May Checkers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should raise the tariffs on the other side was “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims Killed: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of LSU Player's Death
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from LSU (Louisiana State University).
According to Baton Rouge police department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and jailed for a second-degree murder charge.
Officials broadcast the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims would lose his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to being the author of the shooting that killed Wayde.
The defense said it was imposed a US$350,000 bond.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Surgeon's Office issued a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head that reached the neck.
The department praised Louisiana State Police's fugitive unit, the state police's forensics lab, and Southern University police are helping neighbors to get the arrest.
LSU sporting director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement for his "dignity and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 allele was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season's average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade stated that the team was "beaten" and "shocked" by Wayde's passing.
“This is what we worry about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
The ash that casts the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday advised Mexicans to withdraw from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several strands and tremors.
Social media images showed thin layers of gray on the windshields of Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Confrontation between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and as thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote over Catalonia’s secession.
A group of masked proseparatists held by riot police carried eggs and dust paint that created dark dust clouds in the streets that tend to be crowded with tourists.
There were also refreshments later that day with the police, who used the jars to contain the liorta.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting "Neither forget nor forgive" faced Unionist protesters chanting "Long Life to Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries received in the protest, according to local media.
The tension continues to blossom in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters overwhelmingly opted for independence, although the turnout was low and the opposition to secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The protest also took place, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independence demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia achieving independence.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I came to my parents crying with joy when I could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite obtaining an adjusted, but decisive victory in the regional elections last December, this year the Catalan pro-independence parties struggled to keep up the momentum, with many of their best-known leaders in self-imposed exile or detained awaiting trial for their participation in the organization of the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his mobile phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians from both sides.
“There is more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that the next year would be presented to the European Parliament.
"Presenting myself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry arrests a man after a car crashes into a house
Three 33-, 34- and 39-year-old men were arrested after a car rammed several times against a Londonderry home.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. (summer time in Britain).
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the wreckage and the building itself were the damaged parts.
It is also possible that a gun will be fired at the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
Livingston surprised the Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as head coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to raise a level by placing after Hibernian, in second place.
Gerrard’s team remains unbeaten outside the home this year in the Premiership and face the leader, Hearts, next Sunday, from which they split eight points.
But first the Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston remains undefeated in the division by a sixth consecutive game; the head coach, Holt, has not yet known defeat since replacing Kenny Miller or me.
Livingston escapes opportunities in the face of weakened visitors
Holt's team had to move forward long before the moment they scored, as with their control they caused all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened the way but his crossfire did not cross the threshold of the gate; next, Alan Lithgow's shot came out driven by a Craig Halkett header from the other side of the gate.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could put visitors in danger in stop-ball games.
That’s how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston made a draw in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix the Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that time Rangers dominated the possession but encountered an impenetrable defense that prevented much work from being done by guard Liam Kelly.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor caught a shot from Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent the ball out another live ball game from Livingston.
Many crossings were produced in the Livingston area that were continuously cleared, while two penalty requests were rejected: one by hand and the other by a Halkett entry to substitute Glenn Middleton.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont to BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
“It is unanimous, they were excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their upward trajectory.
His style of play and players have only changed since he returned to the top, but part of the credit is from Holt in the way he has driven the team since his arrival.
I had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, led a superbly organized defense while Menga gave them neither a breath throughout the game to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers have lacked inspiration.
Despite working well at times under Gerrard's command, this time they did not reach that level.
They failed the last pass. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. All a call to the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany to have lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to sever ties between NATO allies.
Many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s access to the EU, were discussed.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a giant new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters of Erdogan approached to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the division before a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies when he collides with a car
A cyclist died in a collision in which a car was found surrounded in London.
The accident took place near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m. (summer time in Britain).
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died in the act.
The accident comes months after another cyclist died in a runaway crash on Childers Street just over a mile and a half after Saturday’s accident.
Metropolitan police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family members.
There are road closures and buses have been diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officials Are Injured in Riots
Six prison officers were injured in a high-security prison altercation, according to the prison official.
The disturbance started at Worcestershire’s HMP Long Lartin around 9:30 a.m. (summer time in Britain) on Sunday and still continues.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the riots, in which are involved eight inmates who are contained in a pavilion.
Officers received attention for slight injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Prison personnel were deployed, specially trained, to deal with a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be taken care of for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time between bars.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was known that the director of the prison center had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials had to go to jail to calm a riot in which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (places affected by the drought could benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but it is very likely that it will occur early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix indicated in a Twitter post that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of depression or tropical storm within a 320-kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that spread over a 64-kilometer radius of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Weather Service predict 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 l/m2 on the Mogoll<0xC3><0xB3>n Board of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rockies and the Gran Conca could reach up to 25 or 50 liters, with 100 l/m2 of insulated totals being possible.
For those who are out of danger of sudden flooding, the Rosa rain could be a blessing, as the region is heavily affected by droughts.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-largest category.”
First, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have hurricane force on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heads north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding cold water in the Pacific and therefore losing strength.
For this reason, it is expected to touch land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or on Monday night.
It could rain very heavily in some areas of Mexico, posing a significant flood risk.
“Total rainfall is expected to be between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and it is possible to find up to 250 l/m2,” reports weather.com.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border in the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression and will then continue to climb across Arizona and enter southern Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
“The main danger of Rosa or what remains of it is the strong rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and in the U.S. Southwest Desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause sudden water swirls and debris flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder to find a 16-year-old boy with white gun wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday around 04:00 (summer time in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
According to Somerset police, three boys of 17, 18 and 20 years of age were arrested in the Radstock area during the night.
Officials asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the incident's mobile.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'scared of the Democratic Party's mesmerism and anger'
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the Democratic Party's reckless and outrageous tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "scared of the Democratic Party's mesmerism and anger" throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that she sexually assaulted her decades ago, being a teenager.
Ford also testified in the trial on his charge.
The president said on Saturday that that day the "Americans" were witnesses to Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality, and courage.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best jurists of our time with a history of impoverished public service,” he said, referring to the crowd of West Virginia fans.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment as talking about the importance of Republican results in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks have passed for some of the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t want to do it, but I really do,” he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for big candidates."
Trump has argued that the Democrats’ mission is to “oppose and hinder.”
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place before Friday, a Republican Party aide told CNN.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami cause hundreds of deaths and the number continues to grow
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke through the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke on the ground at the luscofusco, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
“On the other hand, when the threat arose, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were killed,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB in a round of detention in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, logs, home, it wrecked everything I found," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before arriving at the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
Around 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs circulated by the National Disaster Management Agency showed many shops and buildings destroyed, retorted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday’s huge earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “quantum” and said thousands of homes, shopping malls and hotels would come down.
The bodies of some of the victims were trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the casualties and damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Donggala and closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "completely paralyzed and there is no information" from Donggala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” he said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not informing of the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, one can listen to a man who sits on the top floor of a burning building frantically warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people who were on the street.
In a matter of minutes, the water collides against the beiramar carrying buildings and cars forward.
Reuters was not able to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major shutdown that caused communications to be cut across Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Authorities say the army has already started sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated remain in urgent need of food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport has reopened but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from Indonesia’s tsunami exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
During the journey that World Vision personnel traveled to reach the city of Palu, where the employees rescued themselves in canvas shelters erected in the courtyard of their office, they contemplated scenes of total devastation, Mr. Doseba commented.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of on-going assistance in the event of a disaster, some complained that they were preventing foreign humanitarian workers from travelling to Palu with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staffing from abroad can only flow if the place of calamity is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn’t happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the level of a province,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As long as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can open up to international aid, but that time has not yet come.”
As the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of the missing held onto the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that alleviated the depressing argument of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was taken from a nursing home.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had spent two days under the rubble with her mother’s body in her car.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two of the paragliding missing for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As a person with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa hotel crash spread among the parapentist community, she desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, only one grey mark was shown in the messages instead of two blue marks.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he added.
$26,750 stolen while charging a cashier at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was reloading a cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police department.
In the press release, investigative officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car emptied a box in the leisure complex and was preparing to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole a purse he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned the scene, but the police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have any information about your identity, please contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “To be formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has long been known as Ye's nickname, which he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change occurred before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
She will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her attendance for "emotional reasons," according to the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said that same year while talking about his record with radio presenter Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the only one, the only Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness that is in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced that he would prefer to be called Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also turned on by putting on and removing the script and using the capitals.
AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexico’s president-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians again as the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students approaches.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he "would not use the military again to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired upon a peaceful demonstration in the square killing some 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly aid to boys who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag the boys to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in I.A.
According to AI investor and professional Kai-Fu Lee, a sample of Google, Microsoft and Apple, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China’s growing activity in the field.
The comments came after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even if the U.S. lacks a formal strategy on AI.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it aims to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Duplicating the AI research budget would be a good start, given that the rest of the countries are far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Duplicating funding could double the chances that the next AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-rated American Othello player and later became an executive at Microsoft Research at Google’s subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology contests as the Robotic Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when it would be the next to help identify future visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee says.
“China is not who is leading the academic leaders, but the companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university geniuses to work in AI.
Lee pointed out that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its efforts in AI.
“I think they should offer residency cards to doctors in AI,” he said.
China’s state council published its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China offers funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an artificial intelligence center that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Information.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not registered a movement for months.
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum to change the name of the country.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether they wanted to change their name to the "North Macedonia Republic", a movement that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece and block applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbors represents a claim of its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the result would reach the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: “Are you in favor of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, allege that it is a price worth paying to gain admission to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many members of parliament said that they would stick to the outcome of the vote and that they would do it definitively.
The change of nine would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission stated that at 1 p.m. there would be no irregularities.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections of 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko filed their vote for the Macedonian referendum on changing the name of the country that would pave the way for their accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the assembled tents for those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with a high head and not through the door of service," Kavadarkov added.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of joining the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure that is below the required.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people surveyed planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to power in May.
Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero, Manchester City player, crosses all of Brighton's defense and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took Brighton's 2-0 defence from Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy to score the goal of the 65th minute.
The Argentine front received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defences before heading into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He defied a defense before surpassing several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Next, he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English forward used the first touchdown area to return the ball to Aguero, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
“Aguero is going through some foot problems,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that’s when it happened.
We were lucky to have him at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League clash.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero received the ball in the depth of the Brighton field in that game.
He sent a beautiful pass to the hole by the right band towards Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite post.
The Blues put the ball on the doorstep before leaving the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to bring his party to the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the fight for the elimination, there were not many reasons to force another title.
But an always competitive Scherzer hopes to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications in the elimination for the Rockies, which take a game of advantage to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the national league.
The Rockies secured at least one draw with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to close their first division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, at least we can play rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and with the other team would probably be playing at the highest level I’ve played this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in that?”
The Nationals have yet to announce who will open on Sunday, but it appears they are leaning toward Scherzer being the one to launch in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom his 34th start would be, held another bullpen session on Thursday and will likely launch Sunday on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holding a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding the elected Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the outcome in the midterm elections.
“We did everything we did in November.
There are five weeks left for some of the most important choices in our lives.
This is something big, big... I don’t compete, but really if I do and that’s why I’m going everywhere fighting for big candidates.”
Trump went on to say, “Now look at this horrible radical group of Democrats, look at what’s happening now.
And they are determined to regain power using any necessary means, wickedness, and wickedness.
They don’t care who does harm, over who they have to go through to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’ll never give it to them.”
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and hinder.”
“And they’ve seen that in the past four days,” he said, calling Democrats “anxious, bold, noxious, and liars.”
He listed the Senate Judiciary Committee citing Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who received strong applause from the public.
“Do you remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Mmm..ejem, what?
No, mmm, no, hold on... It was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer so open.
They are not tolerant of those who express their opinions.
When my local party’s Momentum activists voted to censor me, the truth is that it didn’t surprise me too much.
After all, they are the last of a series of Labour MPs that we are not well received, and all to say our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she faced with a decision to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, casually issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday indicated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I have been a Labour MP, Friday night committee meetings have been exactly like that.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a “more kind and kind” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and is judged if all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader of the party, when comrades with whom I thought I would share a similar political vision began to expect me to portray and adopt positions with which I would never agree, whether in terms of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly, and actually give a little bit of the same as what I say, there is a tremendous commotion and attacks on social media censoring central politics, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it’s not just about me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my peers, since the comments that address me tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a stream of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every movement of "non-confidence" or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower in sight.
Over the past few years I have received many tips that urge me to keep my head bent, unless it is so frank and that then "everything would be fine for me".
But I didn’t go into politics to do that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party there are 32 still in school, led by the negligence of Thatcher’s government that literally dropped my class, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused if my political stances and in which I disagree with the party’s current leadership.
To those who promoted Friday’s motion, the only thing I would say is that as the country moves toward a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don’t understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the leader of the party.
But, in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat or political convenience will deter me from acting according to what I consider the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An Invincible Ayr Gets Headed
It is possible that the last two attempts would slightly alter the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this beloved Tenent Premier League game.
Now they lead the table and it's the only undefeated team out of ten.
Finally it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact of risking, that led the team to victory. And coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
“So far we’ve been tested in our game and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said, “We have to recognize that Ayr has taken advantage of the opportunities better than we do.”
The 14-minute trial of Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, ceded to the Warriors, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot missed a wrong pitch.
Climo increased the advantage for the Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the medium time, he turned a shot into a solo, leaving the 17-5 mark in favour of the Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a prolonged halt due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who left the field in the padiola and, from the start, Ayr advanced further through a trial by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card and Melrose set out to have one more player with Bruce Colvine's unconsumed trial at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for placarding Climo when he did not have the ball, McPjherson scored a try from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo scored, as he did almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the pitch in David Armstrong's area and sent him to third-line Gregor Henry to get the local team's fifth try.
The protagonist of Still Game starts a new career in the restoration industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after discovering he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with his old partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the final one, and it looks like Kierman is planning another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source from the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s “successful restaurant business.”
‘The sea is us’: Bolivia expects court to pave the way to the Pacific
The sailors watched a naval headquarters covered with apparatus in La Paz.
The public buildings wave a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are drowned out of the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
“Recovering it is a duty.”
In Bolivia without a sea, the memory of a lost coast facing Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict remains alive, as does the desire to re-navigate the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia expects a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the judgment of the CIX on giant screens across the country in the hope that the Court of The Hague will pronounce itself in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is forced to negotiate the granting of Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia the right, and that it would change little if that happened.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to adjudicate Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the judgment of the CIX comes only six months after the final arguments we hear indicates that the case "was not complicated," says the Chilean expert on international law Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could be delayed screen time.
“The issue of access to the sea has long been blocked by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined the goodwill he had left in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume the talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court would take an unusually quick decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile," and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this topic for political purposes.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong, says his nation will not proceed with nuclear disarmament if it can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting stagnant nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "a utopia" that the continued U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration that ends the Korean War are able to bend to the North.
In Washington, he refused to accept the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit of Kim-Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of giant shadows that will soon be in stores.
If you want to increase your collection of shadows or cover yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed on the runway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that embraced the public with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible shadows filled Instagram this summer and these designers brought their most amazing creations to the runway.
Valentino's main piece was an exasperated beige hat adorned with a broad wing imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other large accessories there were knotted watermelons, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks...just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high seam.
One of the creations looked like a complete diving equipment, with the glasses and the tube, and the other a melted ice cone.
And if you're a big fashion fan, you're lucky.
Fashionably understood, I predicted that giant hats could reach the tents.
The disproportionate shadows come just after the "Bomb", the ball hat with a 60-centimeter blade that takes everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks brought out another great creation: a ball beach bag almost as big as the model clad in a swimsuit that carries it.
The orange raffia bag decorated with raffia flakes and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight piece of Jacquemus' La Riviera's 2019 spring summer collection in Paris Fashion Week.
Famed designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I hope the big darkrooms and beach bags will arrive in stores next summer, as the designer had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.”
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for the citizens of the world
The private schools in Scotland maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community matters.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired topic within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, that’s what gets him in the head.
But if you speak with him in your own tongue, then you will reach out to his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people in other countries.
From the results of this year’s recent exams, we can see that the languages are at the top of the board and with the highest approved rates in private schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages got an outstanding one.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up the SCIS, shows that 72% of the students obtained an honorary degree in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding degree.
This demonstrates that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them as key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages are having the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in programs of private schools and of all kinds.
A survey conducted by the UK’s Employment and Training Commission in 2014 indicated that between the lack of knowledge of languages it constitutes 17% of the reasons why employers cost them to cover vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that need languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you learn a second language you will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That’s why it’s so important to invest in a language for today’s children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, provides children with more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the languages of education differ according to the school.
Some schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others decant for languages considered most important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what your children’s interests are, private schools always have several languages to choose from and expert teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the necessary skills to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
We cannot deny that at this time, in a global business environment, languages remain of vital importance to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edwards is the Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron debuts with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James playing for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.
The team's coach, Like Walton, announced that James will play the opening game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It’s up to you to decide how many minutes you’ll play.
"It will be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After early-week training, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to be ready,” he said.
Trump’s election comes to Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be Trump’s first of five scheduled rallies for next week, including stops in cities close to him like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a paused confirmation vote for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump intends to get support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia and how can you see it on the internet?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia to be followed by live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely address the issue of the trial this week to Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and who keeps the Senate confirmation vote suspended for a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans face the November elections with a new impetus.
So these five rallies that Trump will give next week are aimed at "dynamicizing volunteers and sympathizers as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible in the run-up to the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The rally, which will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium, could rally supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
“It’s not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to support him in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until Sunday's individual matches
After three individual sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursome could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging impulse pendulum is a totally invented sports concept but what athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this one.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they're four, so I guess we're taking that as a bit of a boost," Jordan Spieth said as he walked out at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four advantage points with twelve more in play.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel that they have a bit of wind in their favor and a lot to cheer for, among other things, the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each count three points out of four.
Spieth has proved lethal from tee to green and is preaching with the example.
Those guttural cries became stronger as he advanced his round, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
By getting the putt that made them win the game at 15, he threw a similar shout, the kind of shout that he believes the American team is not yet out.
“You just have to focus and worry about your party,” Spieth said.
It’s the only thing left for these players.
18 holes to leave behind.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four of them and cannot be mistaken.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That route, and the way its energy seems to flow to and from the crowd, confirms them as rivals to beat on Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to get a win when the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first run ended with the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they were never close to leaving.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely for the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the ones they don’t, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage over the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA has the stamina to fight, something that some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe has a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of the fourballs and the foursomes with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods with difficulties to climb four points to the scorer at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which seeks to preserve the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning four games, but were unable to cut the advantage.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the initial four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they fit in perfectly to defeat a dislocated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a more categorical 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday without pain or glory, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but now lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome modes and five straight.
Justin Rose, who rested in the morning's fourballs, reunited as his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes scoring a defeat against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world's number one and three.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant day of breeze in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There have only been twice in the history of the Ryder Cup in which a team climbs up four points in the individual, although as the current trophy holder, Furyk's team only needs to tie to preserve it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Korea says no to unilateral disarmament if you don’t have confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would increase its distrust of the United States and that the country would not deliver its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant steps to show its good will" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing fields and committing to the proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see the corresponding response from the US," he added.
“Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first on our part.”
While Ri resumed the already known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to "gradual denuclearization" by virtue of which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, his statement seemed important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as had happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to "denuclearize" the Korean peninsula while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has since sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States declared that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted relaxing the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its coercive goal, and even opposes the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us aggrieved is an impossible dream, for those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions sharpen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the other part of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached a dead end."
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after “evil President” Trump called Kim “a rocket man on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
Trump said there was no deadline for that, and that “it takes two years, three or five months anyway.”
China and Russia are discussing whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip has not gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying he had advanced, just hours before North Korea denounced him for making “mafiatical demands.”
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile deployment as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took the "corresponding measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was asking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
This year, a new Harvard University course is making all of its students sleep more in order to combat the growth of the macho culture of studying all night stimulated by caffeine.
An academic found that students at the world’s number one university often ignore the basic aspects of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and specialist at Brigham and Muller Hospital, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that lack of sleep had on learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why do you only tell me this now, in my last year?’
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects about how acquiring good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had a major lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficits affect athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine at bedtime.
In another section, inform participants about how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this information, just as we have the right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of the pride of spending all night awake still exists, he says. And he adds that modern technology and the growing pressure for students that implied lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough sleep and that you have a good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, signal it. Even avoid becoming fatter, as lack of sleep causes the brain to enter into a mode of starvation, which causes it to constantly starve.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push a course across the campus.
The next step, wait, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended students consider the option of setting an alarm to lie down, as well as for when they wake up. Also, it is recommended that they are aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" that emit the electronic screens and LED lighting, which can unbalance the circadian rhythms.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal downs Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's team intended to record their first home win since the 4–1 victory in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, which left their team eight points from the Hearts, leaders of Ladbrokes, Lidbrokes Premier.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and a Rangers line-up with little inspiration never gave the feeling he was tied up.
As the Rangers came down to sixth, Livingston rose to third and is only behind Hibernian with a goal difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence had to deal with a head injury after the alleged launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept the Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was the same 11-year-old from Livingston who pulled a point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way his organized group has smothered its opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have scored in just two minutes when the short pass of Menga's first season sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's sidekick, but the midfielder wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, only got a tie in the second half.
The Rangers took control, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
Alfredo Morelos felt that they would have to be fined 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only made two shots to the door in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, only had problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While the opening of Livingston in the 34th minute may have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
The Rangers failed again in the face of Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept the blood cold to choose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard acted in the break by switching to Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the left made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to devour visitors by playing exactly the type of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty when he got into a fight with Jacobs, but Thomson regained his fat eyesight.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting... was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A science ploy since then, the Geiger counter has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Home: "What is it in the world?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
By putting these headphones on, the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals can be heard.”
Evans: "Say, I'm sure it's exploding now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells and kill them
Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to Recognize Defective Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory
They can "see" a common protein to various types of cancer and inject it back
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of a patient's immune cells, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to several types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “impulses the growth of various types of cancer,” including those of breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "signals" to address cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a speech in favor of Trump wearing a MAGA hat (Make America Great Again) after his appearance on the Saturday Night Live (SNL) program.
The result was not good
During a Saturday Night Live program, they joined Kanye West in the studio after a confusing presentation in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would run as a candidate in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a cap of Make America Great Again, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white man and say, ‘How can you like Trump if you’re a racist?’
If I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee about the sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, Chris Rock uploaded images of West's criticism to social media.
It is not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had spent a bad time behind bars due to his hat.
“They walked with me behind the scenes.
She said, “Don’t wear that hat.”
Intimidated!
And then they said I was going to the peak," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm going to pee?", saying that I would "use my superman cap, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do."
“Test with love.”
His comments sparked applause in the audience at least twice and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with the following testimony a person who was there gave to the publication: "The whole study remained in absolute silence."
They had named West as the last substitute for Ariana Grande, whose old boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many people perplexed with an interpretation of the song "I Love It", dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West got the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest minds: GRACE TO MAKE FRONT OF MAFIA"
However, the host of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was simply “being who she is and that’s completely wonderful.”
“I chose not to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) that I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is detrimental to my community.
It's free.
Just like us,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "to be officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-handling role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the macho hero stereotype, saying that said roles on the screen translate into it that it seems that young people often have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something failed" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era (#EuTamen).
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she feels "strong enough" to address the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now. Where are we wrong about masculinity?" he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
“Something went wrong with the kids.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, stating that "enough horses and battlefields".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers his encounter with his wife, Rose, to be the best of Game of Thrones.
“I knew my wife on this show, so in a way, I provided my future family and my life from here on out,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health officials said.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV was quickly spread by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in inter-annual terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they say discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies a staff member leaks data from Republican Party senators, “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her staff had published personal information from three U.S. Republican Party senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were being made by websites and commentators of the “ultra-right.”
"Lies, lies and more infamous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released included the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill, the U.S. government headquarters, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed information from a Waters staff member, Capitol Hill said.
“This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, was not responsible in any way for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie.”
Waters' statement immediately sparked online criticism, including those of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial was done with anger," Fleischer wrote.
“It makes sense that he has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something they did not do, they should not be angry.
It should not be challenging.
You should not question the accused’s motives.
It must remain appreciable and serene.”
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of Justice Kavanaugh's Democrats, to which critics accused him of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to run for Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"I'd be happy if it was true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his department had alerted "entities in charge of law enforcement and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent charges.
“We will make sure to find out the culprits as well as that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my team.”
Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in Action), the parody of a spy without power by Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to seek the transcendence of Brexit in new films from a British point of view and it seems this can apply to the return of the Johnny English action comedy and parody franchise, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will it become the ironic satire about the obviously stupid issue that we are in the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, Johnny English's incompetent eyeball and rubber face character renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that it is a general comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinephile territories.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his outrageous claims of adoring glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a Mr. Bean chip and a sidekick of that type who contributed a single note on the theme of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also based originally on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's now-forgotten television commercials, in which he seeded chaos in his footsteps.
There are a couple of good moments in Johnny English’s last outing.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval armor suit and the rotor steps make a brief strand against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps in, but gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when such "serious" films, such as 007 and Impossible Mission, already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if the humor was directed at children, rather than adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English’s extravagant misadventures are not as ingenious or concentrated as Atkinson’s silent film jokes in embodying Bean’s character.
Now the permanently topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber hacker infiltrates Britain’s network of top-secret web spies and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, to the anguish of the agent who is in service, an unfortunate small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the culmination of a pompous and conflicting prime minister who already suffers a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this character who almost looks like Theresa May, but you can’t do much with the script.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that as all active spies have committed themselves, you must remove someone from the retreat.
And this refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher at a snob institution, but gives unofficial lessons on how to become an infiltrated agent; here there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunite with their former and suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin of the Mistakes of His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous falconry: disguised as waiters, they set fire to an ostentatious French restaurant; they create a riot that illegally puts them aboard the luxury yacht of Volta; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to familiarise the interior.
Obviously, all the arrests come out of this last sequence, but in the kind and scandalous way it is, it seems to come from a children's television show.
The result is quite regular.
And, as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: the British film industry can’t offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but charge for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but charge for five.
Allegedly, the party wants employers to pass on the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by offering them an additional day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would continue to receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would “stick” to the party’s economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported the four-day-a-week grievances as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important Labour source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that aligns with the party’s approach to balancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
At the moment, however, the Labour Party does not support the ambition in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working week does not enter the party’s politics and is not being considered by the party.”
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “speculators” in public service companies.
The Chancellor’s plans in the shadow also imply the possibility that current shareholders of water companies do not recover all of their investment, as a labor government could make “deductions” due to perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on corporate boards and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector companies’ shares to employees, who pocket annual dividends worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least a week's final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court. The question arises as to whether the department's findings could influence Republican senators' withdrawal of his support.
On Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to light that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"Let me go to the hearing. I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were dropped and asked him if he had done so.
It was firm, determined, round.”
However, Graham's vote seems to be immovable.
“My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is decided and would make an explosive accusation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett denies it all," Graham said in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people you mentioned couldn’t verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive roster of acting stars and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people coming to command the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event to end poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the attending audience had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help raise awareness about their awareness.
But what is the degree of success achieved by the Global Citizen after 12 years of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to ask for action or is it just another case of so-called “clitivism”, people who think it makes a difference when signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million “actions” of its followers, driving a set of different goals.
It states that these actions helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK company of investors and executives that is committed to "helping children develop to their full potential", with the promise of providing Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 global tweets.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funds for The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with interventions on nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, “what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road and sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
But in the same way that happened with the great anti-apartheid movements and in favor of civil rights that preceded us, we will achieve it, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy to carry out a “blocking” to hinder Russia’s energy exports, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior announced.
“If necessary,” Washington may resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s commitment to Syria, especially where it operates legitimate government agencies, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the same way they did in Eastern Europe,” he said.
In addition, according to the official, they have the means and means to deal with it.
“The United States, together with the Navy, has the ability to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself “the voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He compared Washington’s strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, considering that, in practice, it was the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia saying it “has only one tactic” with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements were made while the Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe in order to replace that of Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was set up to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin has argued that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, which took place in September in Moscow.
The U.S. position obtained the reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organization, the German Industries Federation (BDI), has called on the US to move away from the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Carefully Examine Her 2020 Presidential Candidacy, Massachusetts Senator Says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully consider her candidacy for the presidency following the midterm elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and restore the fractured government and that includes a woman in power,” he said.
"After November 6, I will carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the public assembly, stating that he was “bringing this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said in a tweet "of course an FBI investigation is needed before the vote".
However, in a poll published on Thursday, it was shown that most of Warren’s own voters do not believe it will be presented in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator would not run for office, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of the respondents supported the application.
The survey showed more support for the candidacy of the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names of the Democrats in relation to a possible nomination in 2020, include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) at Donald Trump's meeting
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September
On Monday evening, they arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is going through, what’s going on again, I can see myself reflected in other families that feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are going through,” Trump said at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo subject and that his son and other war veterans “come back different, hardened, wondering if there is any respect for what fellow militiamen and airmen, as well as other members of the army, offered to the country.”
They were arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial remedy in connection with a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives of 18 states and the district filed a court-friendly report in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff's portion of Grace's Sessions v. that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
Detention in Texas.
Attorneys from the states that support Grace described O Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers for the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignore decades of state, federal and international legislation."
“Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be adjudged according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and said prohibition violates that principle,” the court’s friend report said.
The tax authorities continued to debate in the report that the policy that refuses immigrants’ entry damages the U.S. economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they “provide labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and the violence of criminal organizations.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a June 11 announcement.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems (even all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
“The circumstances are very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, consoling her febrile baby at the evacuation center of the fallen city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
And clean water is scarce.”
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their belongings, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, devastated by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, are overflowing.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, were resting outside Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
The tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was at a wedding in the city.
“I heard my wife asking for help and then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Abusing ‘propaganda Ads’
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper preaching the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump made reference to the China Daily payment supplement on the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of running for the U.S. Congress on Nov. 6, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to get into the U.S. election marked what the country’s officials hailed at Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coerce China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in a growing trade war witnessing the level of tariffs on their respective imports.
According to experts from China and the U.S., China’s compensatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to harm exporters from states such as Iowa, which supports Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of China’s leading exporters of agricultural products, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers and U.S. businessmen.
In an opinion article written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of the Moines Register, it was stated that China “is intensifying that campaign of harassment by spreading propaganda advertisements in the free American press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and the press by publishing a payment ad on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, in the place of newspapers located at the end of this Beijing street, there are few dissenting voices and there is no real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese may have on China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he said.
He also claims that "one of China's most important newspapers declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not confirm which newspaper it is.
Kavanaugh's disaster causes female Republican vote to be lost just days after midterm elections
Although many of the top Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite different allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially from female voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The reactions around these accusations were numerous and the majority of Republicans were positioned to move forward with the vote.
"These things cannot be undone," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, said in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last minute for an FBI investigation is enough to calm the spirits of angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future or in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the opponents, in the grip of "About November!", appeared in the Senate corridor, while the Republicans, with the Judiciary Committee's control, decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democrats' motivation and enthusiasm will exceed any expectation," Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
"It's already high,
But it still goes further, especially among the indecisive voting women in the suburbs or those between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the President, do not usually go to the polls.
Before Ford's public testimony detailed his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's candidates, analysts suggested that it was possible to suffer a violent reaction if Republicans continued with the confirmation.
“This has become a disaster for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“This goes beyond the committee vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the defendants’ bench or not. The problem is how the Republicans handled this and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps the Democrats’ election on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between whether to believe the testimony of Ford or that of Kavanaugh, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of people surveyed fully or probably believe Ford’s testimony, compared to 35% who support Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, compared to 30% who think the same as Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations filed by Ford, as well as those of at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked him in a state of drunkenness when he was 17.
On the other hand, Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court candidate showed the genitals at a college party when she was studying at Yale in the 80s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a company based in Solid, the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and that people can access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee Chanced Inrupt’s intention was to “dominate the world.”
"We have to do it," he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data storage" or POD.
They may include contact lists, pending task lists, calendars, music, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data warehouse unique is that the user has complete control over who can access what information.
The company describes this as a “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to its chairman John Bruce, is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers from around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke with “Facebook nor with Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would change their business models from one day to the next.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based web."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has emerged as an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
A tribute to Bernard Vann, a clergyman decorated with the Cross of Victory in World War I
The only clergyman in the Church of England who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the 29th September 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without knowing that he would be awarded the greatest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandsons were tasked with discovering a memorial in his honor at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandmother’s fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade that earned him the title.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the yoke of an intense machine gun fire".
He hastened to reach the line of fire and, with "great courage", led the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without anyone's help, and shot down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandmother’s actions were “something she could never live with, but a lesson still.”
He and his brother Dr James Vann also placed a wreath of flowers after the parade, which led the young band Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he felt "I'm honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genuine hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig Cuts Roll to MMA Fans at Best Moment
Imagine that you’ve been up all night enjoying the full Bellator 206 show, and when you get to the best part something to stop you.
The San Jose poster included 13 fights, six of which were the main ones, and was being broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
But at 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to see the faces, the British viewers were perplexed when Peppa Pig appeared.
Some did not impress them after having spent so many smart hours waiting to see the fight.
A fan described the change to these childhood cartoons on Twitter as "a very unpleasant joke".
“The state regulations ruled that this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., and therefore had to be changed to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the retransmission.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they will take into account UK viewers in future programming.
"I think we can solve it when we think about repetition," Coker said.
“But if it’s 6 a.m. there, we can’t solve it until Sunday, which will be Monday for them.
But we are working to find a solution.
When the change occurred, I started to receive many messages and not all were pleasant.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical error.
No, it was a government problem.
I promise it won’t happen again.
We will limit ourselves to five fights, instead of six. We wanted to give the maximum to our fans, but we passed and
There's a lot of rabies."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels inferior due to his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to triumph.
This 24-year-old athlete claims he didn’t realize that not everyone was like him until he got to the institute.
Invited to the first broadcast of the Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program led by Lauren Laverne, she explained that she started talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him to relativize the importance of winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of this program, is low on disease.
As a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley shared that she felt "lower" to the rest of the people because "it was not socially acceptable for them to like boys and girls."
“To this day, that feeling of inferiority and of being different is what pushed me and gave me the strength to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that he was "someone" so that people wouldn't be disappointed in discovering his sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, “was quite a surprise.”
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20 years of difference between them were never a problem.
“When you live so much in so little time” (at only 14 years old you first participated in the Olympic Games and your father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone your age who experienced similar highs.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley completely change his perspective.
“If you ask me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal,” he says.
“But now I know there are things much more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 due to brain cancer.
Daley's father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son was a ticket to London in 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell you I wouldn’t be here to occupy that first row,” Daley said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that precise moment, at the time of his death, when I realized that it was really not invincible,” he added.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At the time I knew that was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
The choice of Heather Small's Proud song is also not in vain, as it is the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still puts his hair on top.

A Mickelson in low form ended up at Ryder Cup bank this Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but must improve his technique so that he does not become an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participated in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed at the bank by the decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourball or the foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, as so many other times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his movements.
Although he was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the height of his career, at the age of 48 he did not fit in the tight Le Golf National field, where the tall grass used to punish the wrong shots.
And if that wasn’t enough, Mickelson faced the British Open winner Francesco Molinari in Sunday’s ninth game, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win this week’s four games.
If the Americans, four points below the start of the 12 individual games, start on foot, Mickelson’s performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his man, although he could not say much more.
“He understood perfectly the role he played today, gave me a palm on my shoulder, passed my arm and told me he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“I was completely confident in myself.
It has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t want to play two games.
I thought I’d play more, but in the end, that’s how things are and that’s how we thought they should be.
Like everyone else, you want to be out there.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record in the largest number of games played in the Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, a career that never reached the level of his individual palmer.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk claims his presence also provides the team with unbeatable.
"He's a fun, sarcastic person, he's smart and he likes to get along with people, he's a good guy to have on the team," he said.
"I like to see the good that the younger players have spent with him this week.
It’s a lot more than a good player.”
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, fears the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup individuals can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Great Danes made their debut in 1997 at a game in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but ended up reaching the finish line with a minimum lead winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep thinking that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won for little,” Bjorn reflected in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this has not yet ended.
Tomorrow we have to go for all of them.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the points are on the marker.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I’m not going to get tired of saying that, I’m focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I’m also very aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Enchanted with his players' performance on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we face the other beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual actions, and there we also have to prove our worth.
It’s great to be with a partner when things go well, but when you face things individually, then put your golfing skills to the test.
That’s the message you need to convey to the players, who get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will look for his players to have a better individual performance than with his teammates, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those last-day laps, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but finishing as a loser after a European miracle at Medinah."
“I remember every damn word,” he replied when asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, would rally players to the final day.
"We have 12 important matches, but you would like to have a quick start like Brookline or Medinah.
When you see the momentum going in one direction, there is a lot of pressure in these intermediate games.
We prepare our line-up with this in mind and put the players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the top half of the standings.
“I decided this order because I think it covers the whole way,” Bjorn explained about his selection for the individual.
Germany's new warship postponed once again
The German Navy’s youngest frigate was supposed to have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but will not arrive until at least next year due to faulty systems and increasingly expensive, local media reported.
The deployment of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, was delayed until the first half of 2019, a military spokesman told the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships, commissioned by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as concealment technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deploy the youngest frigates up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuous delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be obsolete when they enter service.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little was known of the reasons behind this return, but German media spoke of "critical defects in software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half the necessary personnel in the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add improvements in the future.
It is thought that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it has already reached the astonishing amount of 3100 million euros, compared to the initial 2200 million.
The problems of the newest frigates are particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is making water.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships capable of deploying.
The officer claims that this problem is increasing, as the old ships were withdrawn, but not replaced by others.
He also regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust spying on the secret life of batsmen
A new research that is being carried out on a Scottish Highlands farm aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland association will follow the bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the bats Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of the batsmen during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
A sound analysis performed by experts of all recordings will determine the frequency of calls from bats and what each species is doing.
Next, a Habitat Map will be developed to create a detailed image of the landscape scale of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’ Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results show which areas of habitat are more important to bats and how they use them each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and what is the best way to keep forests for bats and other associated species.
Populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by the construction and development works that affect children and the loss of habitat.
Aerogenerators and alumina also pose a risk, as well as fly glue traps, some chemical treatments of building materials, and domestic cat attacks.
The bats are not blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated ecolocalization technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct periodic surveys, inspections of children, and sometimes even rescues.
The organisation even counts Scotland's first and only reserve of bats at Threadave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten species of bats.
David Thompson, Estate Manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
“In Threadave we have a large area for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there are many things we still don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
Highlights the importance of controlling the presence of bats before performing maintenance tasks on the properties, since it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single child of motherhood can kill up to 400 females and children, which could exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or harass them, as well as destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
"There is still much to learn about bats and, in the case of many species, we do not know how they are going to their populations."
Ronaldo dismisses claims for rape and his lawyers prepare to sue for German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo qualifies the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to make themselves known using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these allegations.
The head of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
It is alleged that the footballer paid the woman $375,000 to say nothing about the incident, Der Spiegel published on Friday.
Hours after its publication, 33-year-old Ronaldo posted this fake news in a live video from his Instagram account, which counts 142 million followers.
“No, not a thousand times.
What was said today is false,” the five-time Golden Ball winner told the House.
“People want to get to know me by using my name.
It's normal,
They want to be famous by just saying my name, they are part of my work.
I’m a happy and respectful man,” the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers will be prepared to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they describe as “an inadmissible statement of suspicions in the area of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2019, in a suite of the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court of Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, was upset by saying that he was 99 percent a knight, but that that 1% betrayed him.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that both have maintained sexual relations agreed by both parties.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and that she had photographs of the wounds, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt terrified by the reprisals and was concerned about public embarrassment.
The 34-year-old woman says she seeks to revoke the agreement while she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Carmakers will leave the UK
The UK would forever regret losing its position as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK claimed on the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need to reach an agreement,” Clark added.
The Japanese carmaker said that in the event that Brexit did not reach any agreement, the impact of delays on the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced some 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnessing how production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is very tight, with parts from UK and EU suppliers arriving every 37 minutes for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and delays and shortages could be generated.
The company says it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal pace more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid such border controls."
"It is essential to have an agreement. And we want it to be the best agreement, so to enjoy the current success but also to make the most of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains."
Toyota could not estimate how long production would stop, but warned that in the long run the costs involved would reduce the plant's competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, Burnaston employee for 24 years and union coordinator for Unite, said his members are increasingly concerned: “From experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said they presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again
The White House said Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Justice Undersecretary Rosenstein could be delayed one more week due to the fight by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Russia’s aides and Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump dismisses the attorney general or not, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence, has fuelled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of ousting the President by way of the 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, among reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual conduct, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "There is still no set date, it could be this week or it could be a week late, given everything that is going on in the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, but you know I like that the press is informed.”
Some journalists questioned that claim, as Sanders has been taking it since September 10 without holding a press conference.
When presenter Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders claimed that the lack of an information session was not due to an aversion to the reporters' generosity, although he added that it will not be she who denies that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president grants more interviews than the previous president," he said, although he did not cite any sources that backed that data.
Information meetings will continue to be held, Sanders said, but insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the president of the United States, that's much better than addressing the questions to her.
You are witnessing how we have been doing this over the past few weeks, and that will replace a press round in which you can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries.
However, solo press conferences are scarce.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the motive this week in New York, with a free and sometimes odd appearance before the assembled journalists.
A letter from the Ministry of Health to calm the mood in the face of Brexit
The Ministry of Health addressed a letter to EU workers at the NHS in Scotland expressing the country’s gratitude and expressing its desire to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has committed to cover the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on abandonment continued, and decisions are expected to be reached this autumn.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also stepped up its preparations for a possible standoff.
I know this is a period of inconsistency for everyone.
That is why I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
The partners of the European Union and beyond, provide an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a linebacker for the Tennessee State Tigers, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's 31-27) defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennesseean's Mike Organ reported.
Rod Reed, the Tennessee State coach, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
It seemed as if he was getting on the bandwagon.
The trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before taking him on a stretcher to carry out a later evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician told Chris Harris, a WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Also, he added that there are still no details of the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year Red T-shirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five innings in total on Saturday before leaving the game, raising his total to 18 of the season.
A stamp duty will apply to foreign buyers who purchase a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK. This additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new Conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the stamp duty applies to those people who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with pledges to promote more accessible housing and focus on high-income people.
The increase in stamp duty will apply to people and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money raised will serve to support the government’s campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp duty, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and purchases to rent, can be up to 3%.
Facenda expects the change to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13% of new constructions in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which is causing price increases and making it difficult for people who want to buy a home for the first time to have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “pant cities” due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the estate transfer tax to help new people buy their first home.
He accused the major builders of keeping housing prices high by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenue on moderate-priced homes to fix the "disgrace of the housing sector" that lives in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of housing-related reform proposals, including the control of tenants and the prohibition of defamatory measures in which the tenant is not to blame.
He also wants to give the municipalities greater powers in building new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that, it is necessary to fix the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to what it wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is as simple for those people who do not live in the UK, as it is for companies based abroad, to buy housing as it is for working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity of not having a roof remains too real.
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland's manager, Jack Ross, said his "last ambition" was to become Scotland's selector at some point.
This 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northwestern club, which currently occupies the third place in League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in Team B, and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“I grew up watching Scotland play Hampden many times with my father when I was a kid, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in leading a club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he didn't feel any concern about the success of such consolidated figures in such a large club after previously rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me will depend at this point if I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly the property of a Premier League club," he said.
"It's not going to be an easy task to come by, but it's likely that he will only consider me successful here if I can return the club to the Premier League."
Ross has only been a coach for three years after an assistant period at Dumbarton and a 15-month period within the Hearts technical staff.
During that period, he helped Alloa recover from the downhill to the third division and managed to get St Mirren to be on the verge of downhill winning the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to be more comfortable now than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably at a real crossroads," he recalled, about taking over Alloa.
“I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird because it didn’t go wrong, I’ve won reasonably well and enjoyed some success.
Playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you need to do each week.
I continue to suffer from stress and pressure at work, but I like to train.
I’ve always enjoyed training and now that I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life.”

According to a survey, the perfect time to take a painting is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7 percent increase during July, but restaurant consumption dropped 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, member of the CGA trade advisory, in charge of compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and England's stay in the world of football for longer than expected caused a similar pattern to June, in which the pubs enjoyed a 2.8 percent increase in their consumption.
The drop of 1.8 percent in restaurant business volume during June worsened during July.
Pubs and bars specializing in beverages were the ones that got the best results with higher consumption increases than the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Pubs specializing in food also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It’s like people just want to go out and drink.
“In controlled pubs and bars, beverage consumption increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food consumption decreased by three percent.”
Paul Newman, an employee of RSM’s leisure and hospitality activities analysis firm, said: “These results suggest a continuation of the trend that has been occurring since late April.
The time and impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in relation to consumption outside the home.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 percent per year will be especially painful if the continued increase in costs is added to it.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents.
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "Fake Insta" pages
This news has caused an increase in the fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11 years old) are creating social media accounts that keep adults secret.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of “False Insta” accounts (referring to the social network Instagram photo exchange).
This news has caused an increase in the fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they used a softened "principal" account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account found a teenager who asked her to be “violated.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most awarded Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys tremendous respect within the Scottish community, the UK and globally, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will greatly benefit from its incorporation into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am very much looking forward to being a spokesman for the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American woman, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games among a total of four Olympic golds and currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented her from being able to walk.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered from apoplexy.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and to what degree.
It was a exhausting job, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and I’m currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for your message of encouragement.”
An advertisement of a breast milk extractor in comparison to women with cows divides public opinion on the networks
A company of breast milk extractors shared public opinion on the networks with an ad in which it compares to nursing mothers with cows being mutated.
To announce the launch of the world’s “first silent portable breast milk extractor,” Elvie has released an ironic music video-style ad to demonstrate the freedom the new breast milk extractor offers.
Four royal mothers dance in a barn full of fire for the cows to the rhythm of a song with lyrics like: "Yes, teach me myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Because if you didn't notice, they're not drunk, they're my breasts".
The chorus continues: “Mouse, muse, I’m feeding the babies, muse, muse, I’m musing my friends.”
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, caused controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 plays and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions among the viewers. Many of them claimed that this exposes the “horrors” of the dairy sector.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Just like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but in their case we steal their children days after giving birth.”
The Elvie milk extractor can be discreetly placed inside a maternal susceptor (Elvie/nai)
Another viewer commented on the following: "Clearly traumatic for the mother and baby.
But if so, why aren’t they used to advertise a milk extractor for the mothers who are left with their babies?”
Another viewer added the following: "Let me announce with so little touch."
Other viewers defended the ad, even one woman claimed that the song seemed "very funny".
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Taking out my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little off-putting, but I interpreted it as a joke.
It’s a great product,” one wrote.
Another commented: “This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or in bathrooms) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their subjects.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, Elvie's milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and can discreetly fit into a mother's pad, which gives women the freedom to move, suck their babies, and even get out while they're extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and executive creative director commented: “The Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative release.
In describing the parallelism between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges it entails while demonstrating in an entertaining way and close to the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
This is not the first time Elvie has held the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked on the runway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of emigrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part because of the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to assign godparents to the children.
Traditionally, most fathers were also undocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardise their ability to remain in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that those data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
"About 80% of people who are paedophiles or who are part of the home of these are illegally located in the country, and a large part of these are foreigners who committed crimes.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these individuals,” Mr Albence said.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require any of them to appear in court before it expires a month from their detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the refugee workers.
Many will appear through videoconference rather than in person to try to legalize their case in front of an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be promptly deported.
The longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent abductions or attempts to flee according to shelter workers and system reports published in recent months.
The lawyers said that these fears increase in centers of larger dimensions such as Tornillo, in which there is more chance that the symptoms that a child is going through will go unnoticed due to their size.
They also added that displacing children in the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could be a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls on the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were found on Syrian soil illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in a timely manner."
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism has almost ended” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also said Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “of any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the appropriate conditions were given for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for the "spreading of irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
"We are calling on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer aid for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last large rebel stronghold of Idlib has allowed political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian troops in the province, in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear boundary data" and expressed his hope that military actions would target jihadists, including soldiers from the al-Nusra front linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draw up a draft post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions to ensure the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the body's work should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would get re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals will be waiting, impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency prematurely.
What would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of a presidency”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among observers.
Since 2014, prime-time audience ratings have multiplied by more than two, reaching 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to reach 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, an increase of 1.7 million compared to four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the cable channel's audience indexes with 3.5 million viewers during the nights it took place.
“It’s like a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, showrunner of the ABC drama “Designated Survivor,” which is about a secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
It’s like a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
He said he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'Because you make me laugh,'" said Mrs. Scovell.
There is entertainment within the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, Washington’s plotlines can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
Still, I suppose something that goes beyond being an informed citizen spending six hours watching a panel of experts debate on Bob Woodward's use of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", the 15,000-dollar ostrich bomber jacket by Paul Manafort ("a garment full of arrogance", "a garment that implicates Washington's arrogance").
I'm not going to look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it’s giving something new every night,” commented Brent Montgomery, senior executive at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, a space that deals with the character changes and the various daily arguments of the Trump show.
You can't afford to miss an episode or you'll be left behind.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, I was sunbathing and a temperature of 26 degrees outside the house, on the north coast of Kauai, but I was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording on CNN.
He was unable to disengage while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court on a wire.
“I remember when we were doing all those stupid shows at the time and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Foreign money reaches more to fund the House’s candidacy for the election of half of the legislature
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two career representatives to occupy the same post.
This district located on the outskirts of Pittsburgh that was recently reorganized is represented by the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, who secured his seat in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is pitted against another acting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is largely superimposed on the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that Republicans manipulated the electoral constituency of the old districts in their favor.
The election career in the new 17th congressional district sparked a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee of the Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after winning a tight victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which enjoyed wide follow-up.
That post was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States assessed the possibility of penalizing The Savior for his support of China and then threw themselves back.
Diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama would already recognize Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners threw the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials have decided to order the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in O Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "for recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman in a statement made earlier this month.
However, only the possibility of imposing sanctions against O Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in U.S. aid during 2017, was contested, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the emigration of people to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of imposing sanctions on O Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to lead the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance it attaches to the administration, diplomats said.
The three U.S. envoys returned discreetly to O Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal deliberations whenever and whenever the anonymity of the participants was maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration and he also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was retained.
Studying history
The next negative case could be Special Adviser Robert Mueller’s report on the case of possible obstruction of Mr. Trump’s justice, of which there is currently abundant evidence in the public file.
Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation to find out whether Mr. Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to account for that body, just when he has to prepare for the election, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
They are many unknowns and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable, as is the fall of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to strike a coup against Hitler if the Western Front resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy accelerates or lags behind.
The Americans are facing several of these turning points at this time.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been carrying the water to his neck since the paper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was incapacitated for office.
Mr. Rosenstein has stated that The Times' information is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or is not impartial or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite the crippling allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that demands responsibilities to Mr. Trump?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, thanks to the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my home, which I knew from the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to trap Shabbat candies on that table that included a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans has been optimistic about meeting Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers received the Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal this same month, would put them in a very favorable position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
An injury to the knee prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from debuting this season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard to achieve more important things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could get something positive and we reached a point.
We had the chance to win in the final, but in general, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second we were better.
Next Thursday is going to be another big European night.
We hope to be able to reach all three points, but it will be difficult, because they got a good result in their last game, but with the support of our audience, I am sure we can fight to get a positive result.
"Last year was tough between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes produced in the team, but there is an excellent environment at this time.
The team is good, the guys are good and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, to forget last season and to succeed.”
Women are concerned about the savings for their retirement.
Despite the fact that the survey participants were clear about how they wanted to be taken care of, few people spoke to their family about the matter.
About half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide stated that they commented with their partners on the cost of extended care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
“People want her to be taken care of by a family member, but they’re not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance department.
You can start with the following.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t tell them your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and family to wake up where and how to receive care, as those decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor will also be able to help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
The options for financing extended care include a traditional extended care insurance policy, a cash value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance covered with your own funds, whenever you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and make sure that the professionals meet your wishes in case you are not able to communicate with you.
It also assesses the possibility of signing a notary power to manage your finances.
You must choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your parent or grandparent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write down that information in detail in a written plan to be prepared.
“Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who are attending it?” asked Martin.
"What medicines are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Set up a plan.”
A man receives several shots with compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with a compressed air rifle as he walked back home after going out in the evening.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not serious and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, killed at least 384 people, a figure expected to continue to rise.
Due to the cut-off, the rescue corps were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Célebes Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that is found along more than 300 km of coast northwest of the island of Celebes.
This regency, an administrative region less than one province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the province of Célebes Central, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Donggala in 1996, causing the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire with high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra, which occurred on December 26, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half, in Aceh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of people and killed approximately 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake hit the Aceh-based Pidie Jaya slum, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami on this occasion, but more than 100 people died due to the fall of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, which caused the deaths of more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of a domestic violence crime, to prevent the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and resistance to authority, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took off his phone.
Palin remains in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 bond, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, immediately" when he was questioned, the prison said.
Palin faces three minor type A crimes, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and receive a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a minor B crime, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in court for Alaskan war veterans.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, with preventing the filing of a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His wife accused him of putting a fist on his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome that she suffered after serving with the army in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami Cause Hundreds of Deaths
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the death toll is expected to rise over the course of the day.
The earthquake occurred right in front of Celebes Central, in the northeastern Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They circulate videos through social networks in which the moment of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek to impose a death penalty on the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike lane on Lower Manhattan’s West Side Highway, following the lives of the pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and that he caused them serious injuries "intentionally", according to the notification of the intent to apply for death penalty filed in the South District of New York.
Both crimes involve the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the judge’s document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment of 22 crimes, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "remarkable planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullahevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnancco" according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The South District of New York has not filed a death penalty case in a decade.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret during the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he was doing, police said.
Saipov told authorities that to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the videos of ISIS that he viewed on his phone according to the indictment.
He also asked to be able to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He was found not guilty of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys in charge of representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the indictment's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence conviction without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Tory MP Says NIGEL FARAGE Should Be Faced With Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an "army of people" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested she should take charge of negotiations with the EU.
MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have “already left” the EU if Mr Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile the divided ranks of her party was evident by joining the Tories in favour of remaining in the EU in an independent protest against Brexit held in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep the commitments of her Chequers plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, the opposites and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continue to fight to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone stated in the concentration of Solihull's Leave Means Leave movement that he wanted to end Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be counted on to take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been given the job, we would already be outside the EU at this time," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort Chequers’ plan.”
Arousing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We do not fight world wars to serve.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone denied suggestions that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false.”
Tories member and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also went to the march, from which she told reporters: “The only thing I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular among the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to have sex elected.
Cancel Chequers' plan and start listening."
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said in the concentration that it is necessary to make politicians “feel uncomfortable” if they intend to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Today this is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray the Brexit decision and here we are meeting today to tell them that we will not let them go with theirs.”
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit decision, feel uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the army of people in this country who gave us victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous UK.”
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU made a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists waved banners with the Tories Against Brexit message after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labourman Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered in an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a border without friction, to enjoy a free market without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s an absolute farce.
The concept of good Brexit does not exist,” he added.
Warren plans to seriously think about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider her candidacy for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday during a municipal session in a town in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been the focus of speculations that place her as Trump’s successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the format of the council since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to introduce himself to the president.
Warren responded that it is time for “women to go to Washington to fix our government’s problems, and that’s what makes a woman fail in the presidency.”
An arrest has been made in connection with the deadly shooting of Sims, the player of LSU
Baton Rouge police, The Angels, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson in a press conference held at 11:00 a.m.
They will post a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify a man who came out in the pictures.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result,” Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 2-meter-old who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 titles last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton came close to the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to achieve victory above Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes team orders would prove decisive in the race.
Bottas, who was leaving from pole, had a good start and almost left Hamilton only while defending his position during the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel got into boxing first and let Hamilton run with traffic in the back of the group, which would be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in boxing a lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after several wheeled maneuvers that caused Ferrari's driver to leave the interior unlucky at the risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver in the third corner.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the exit grid and went up to seventh place at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for much of this thanks to which he kept his tyres to get faster in the final and advance Kimi Raikkonen to fourth position.
He finally got into boxing on lap 44 but was unable to advance any position in the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
"The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two places," Hamilton said.
A Body Language Is Not Enough
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in an act on Saturday for insisting she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
In a speech at an event in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and commented in his place that what was happening in the Senate demonstrated that people were "mistakeable, repugnant and lying."
“The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the outrage, when you see that people are angry and that they are miserable, disgusting and lying,” he said.
“When you see these posts and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you do any filtration?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document?: "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Wait a minute.
“No,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t filter his story,” Feinstein told The Hill.
“I asked him to keep his confidentiality and I did what he asked me to do.”
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented on the following during Saturday night’s event: “I told you that body language was not the right one.
It may not filter it, but it used the worst body language I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Continuing with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, which was accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and repugnant, no matter who they hurt, who they have to fight to regain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the loss suffered on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants winning the game back by 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained an early lead by two goals Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the local assembly before Dwyer reinstated the Giants advantage.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals allowed them to win.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to bounce back to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the three previous wins for the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal came in the 3:35 minute thanks to Kendall McFaull's assist, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after David Rutherford's assist.
In an early period, Sullivan again put the local team in the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to score the match goal at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants advanced to the score before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard again tied the game with a goal by power play in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen advance to Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and secured victory by his team's fifth goal in the latter half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at home in Milton Keynes, which will be held on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of passengers on an airplane can escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller considered a hero after he died to ensure that a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
The death toll is 800, and many are missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to feel in the area and there are many people who are trapped under the rubble of the city of Palu.
Although his co-workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower of Palu’s Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport, which was violently rocking.
He remained in his place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision was likely to save hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
“Let’s break our hearts when we find out,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could be in the thousands, and the country's disaster management agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
“The balance of victims believes it can continue to increase because there are many bodies under the rocks and many of them could not be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are looting the minimarkets.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now claims there is a missing person after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline that operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims there is a missing person after previously claiming that the 47 passengers and crew left without incident the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline said it was working together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and all were stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the lagoon before arriving at the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane passed the runway long ago.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he entered with very little height.
“That’s something extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers were able to advance between the water that reached their waists until the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also recalled that the flight attendants were screaming and frightened, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors who were working near the site on the task of improving a dock also assisted in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to the coast before the plane sank approximately 30 meters.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none have affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office referred to the evidence on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to recompose the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was meeting with Chambers the night of his death contradicting his previous claims, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When this data showed that his mobile phone was in contact with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police were talking to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the stage on Saturday and testified that that day he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers since he was about two weeks old when he died.
The phone records indicated that they had only known each other since a week ago.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“I love your life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the judge to be seen for trial by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception that gender has by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol group, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and struggles against social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get combative hip hop back to being popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common recently experienced a resurgence in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York City child caregiver demands a couple after a "racist" message
A New York child caregiver will sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that was not addressed to her from the mother who complained that she was "another black".
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the demand with an “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her anguish when she discovered that child caregiver Giselle Maurice was black when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOON, OTHER BLACK," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending her to her husband, however, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, an "inconvenient" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the caretaker who had just left, who was African-American, was doing her job wrong and that she was expecting a Filipino according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs. Maurice paid for her work day and sent her home on an Uber.
Maurice will now sue the couple for compensation for the dismissal and demand a compensation of $350 per day for the six months of internal work for those who were initially hired even though there was no middle contract.
“Look, I want to show you that these things don’t happen,” he told the Post on Friday, adding later, “It’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to accusations of racism by stating that firing Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid of not being able to trust her after offending her.
“My wife sent him a message that she didn’t intend to send.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would they leave their children in the hands of a person to whom they have offended, even if it was because of a mistake?
Is your baby just born?
Come on!"
After comparing the lawsuit to an “extortion,” Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby for two months and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to go for a guy like that?
That’s not very ethical,” the investment banker added.
As the legal process continues, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social media, attacking them for their behavior and applied logic.
Paddington's editors feared readers would not identify with a talking bear if they could end up in a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It’s really fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s enormous success.”
After stating that his father, who worked as a camera for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book on a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility of his work being rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "greasy" after his death last year.
From Paddington, to what he describes as a “very important member of our family,” he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
“He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous,” he said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who gets something: you’re proud even if you didn’t really do it.
I think I felt Paddington’s success a little bit like that.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye through the phone
After the landing, his daughter was quickly taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save his life.
“Nad called regularly to say that he was very bad, that he wasn’t expected to survive.
“Then I got Nad’s call to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And they did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were slowly consuming and abandoning her body.
He died a long time ago and is now dying.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it was happening.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in that moment of struggle for the loss of her daughter, entered the plane with the other passengers, without noticing the calvary she was suffering.
"No one detected it," he said.
“I had my head down and I was getting tired all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this impressive feeling of solidarity for Nad.
I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Posts of distressed women to avoid suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones due to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys carry cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when she began to suffer from depression, and committed suicide when she was 18.
“I don’t want any father to feel like I have to feel me every day,” he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up every room.”
However, he left the job before he died and was “in a very deep depression.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis commented: "I have continued concern that a side effect is occurring."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if you are a friend.
Don’t be silent, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, has lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he was sad or depressed or anything like that,” he said.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
The day of Christmas touched the bottom (when the children opened their gifts, they made no visual contact with them or anything).”
He claimed that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it: “He has torn down the family.
They defy us.
But we have to move forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a thread as FBI investigates
“I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking for (an investigation for a limited time and limited scope), we might be able to get some unity,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “disrupting” due to the paralysis of the supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Its reluctance is due to a matter of deadlines.
There are five weeks to go before the midterm elections (November 6). If, as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush was calling senators, putting pressure on them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI carries out its report?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors in North Korea falls under Kim’s mandate
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has been reduced since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said there were 1,127 desertifications in the past year, far from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people charged to pass people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of the North's deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul declares that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority of them go through China, which has the largest third of the border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as illegal emigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them.
Relations between the north and the south (which technically continue at war) have improved markedly over the past few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un held in Singapore, in which they agreed to work hard to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress since then.
"If we don't have confidence in the United States, we can't trust our national security, and under these circumstances there is no possibility that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says it is not fit to access the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit by his nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman ever behaved that way, she would be called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when she was a teenager.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and lingering as he described his family and his school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats, citing the charges against him as a "murder of grotesque and coordinated reputation" organized by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that he believed Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not access the Supreme Court because it showed that he had prejudices against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he is confirmed in office and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
“What I have to say is this: if you’re not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it’s not appropriate to be not just in the Supreme Court, but in the court you’re currently in,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about possible resolutions that Kavanaugh could adopt against the law of patient protection and care for accessible health or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In view of confirmation, Kavanaugh evaded questions about whether certain Supreme Court decisions would be overturned.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the court and still wait for us to say, look what good!" said Pelosi.
And women need to exercise it.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of rage overflowing, and cannot expel it without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that weird, do you?”
He continued: “I received a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she was also crying when she got angry, but who developed a technique that consisted of, when she got angry and started crying, saying to the person I was talking to, ‘Well, this is the best thing you’re thinking about.
But I'm angry."
And then, he continued.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my sharpest memories in one of my first jobs in a men-dominated office, where I began to cry with an irresponsible rage, was that a larger woman grabbed me from the back of the neck, a distant superior who always caused me a slight fear, and led me to the hollow of the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They believe that you are sad and that they will comfort you if they come to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bids.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on an off-marriage adventure on a boat named Monkey Business and was removed from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider the idea of running for president.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," I said in a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
They called it the Brancaneves and the Seven Pineapples.
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed in fundraising, so he swore he would not enter the race for the presidency unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of those who supported her contributed $1,000 to male candidates would only contribute $250.
“What do you think, I have a discount?” he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by the emotions (thankful to the people who supported it, of frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and addressed voters instead of delegates and angered by existing sexism) that ran out of words.
“You’d think she’d have a nervous breakdown,” recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
“You’d think Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my gravestone?
"Chorou?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could turn out to be positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the U.S.-China trade war were heartbreaking and, although the war is far from over, a distance between countries may prove beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year recording key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with the application of new tariffs affecting an equivalent of $200,000 million, recording half of the articles coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has repeatedly counterattacked in the same way, the latest rising tariffs from five to ten percent to $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has promised to imitate U.S. measures and it seems unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will change in the short term.
To get Washington to back down, it would be necessary to give in to their demands, but to publicly bend to the United States would be far more shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could favor China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions necessary to start an economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-centric researcher at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ‘ready’ for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions are improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the necessary conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to abandon due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods are now being given.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another 6 million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating the U.S. team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive defeat of the United States on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.

“I don’t cry often, but today I can’t help it.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get the cup back.
The important thing is the team, and I’m happy to be able to help,” said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the testimony to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat American golf legend Tiger Woods for 2&1 in Sunday's individual match.
“It’s amazing how proud I am today to be able to beat Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching that boy play,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
It is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, a 14-major winner, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems throughout the weekend not to get out of the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, for a moment, they put the Europeans in trouble.
We're fighting.
I took the hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
The 12 players played very well.
We will reorganize, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
It's to get the hat out.
They were superior.”
