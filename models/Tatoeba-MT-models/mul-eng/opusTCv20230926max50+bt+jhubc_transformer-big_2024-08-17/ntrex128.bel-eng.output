The other members of the House of Representatives are worried about what they look like as a marionette.
Some MPs do not understand why their MP status should be changed to the status of a “Wales Member of Parliament”.
Deputies were outraged by plans to change the name of the local east to the name "Parliament of Wales".
All of the political parties believe that this is a political issue.
One Labour MP said that his colleagues are concerned that it is rhymed with the words “dumb” and “unlucky”.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "dull", and pwp means "innocent".
The deputy said that her group was completely dissatisfied and offered an alternative.
The Wallian conservatives said their group was ready to discuss the change of the name of the east, but noted that it was a brief verbal transition from a member of the Wallian parliament to a "marionetak".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is now drafting a bill on the introduction of amendments to the name, made the statement: “A final decision on any description of what the members of the East are calling will, of course, be a matter of the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gives the Welsh East the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on the proposals, in which there was broad support for calling the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of additional deputy, the Commission has given preference to Members of the Welsh Parliament or the House of Commons, but the option of the House of Commons has received the greatest support during public consultations.
Additional deputies, of course, offer alternative options, but the way to reach a consensus can be a major pain for the president, Elin Jones, who is expected to present a bill on changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes in the work of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of additional deputies and changes in the structure of the system of committees.
Additional Deputies will conduct a final vote on the question of what to call them when they are performing their legislative work.
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters voted to change the name of their country to "North Macedonia" or against it.
The national vote was organized with the aim of resolving a multi-year issue with neighbouring Greece, which has its own area called Macedonia.
In Athens, it has long been insisted that the name of their northern neighbor is a claim on their territory, which has hindered Macedonia's inclusion and friendship in the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Macedonia's President George Ivanov, a supporter of the name change referendum, said he would not take part in the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is just a price that needs to be paid for joining the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The so-called St. Martin's Church is silent, the botchers in Harlem are fighting for existence
“In the past, as the old people I spoke to said, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr Adams said.
“There’s neither one nor the other here today.”
He said that the disappearance of the bar was understandable.
“People have different relationships and relationships at the moment,” he said.
“Bars are no longer a cozy local guesthouse, where people walk all the time.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough for as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they will return to where they started.
The churches, he added, can be replaced by living ladies with candaminiums, filled with people who will not help the temple that will remain in the area.
“The vast majority of residents who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and that’s why it will speed up the day these churches close together because it’s unlikely that the majority of people who pass by will get there.
Both churches were built by a white community before Harlem became a black area – the Church of the Central Community in 1870, the Church of St. Martin – a decade later.
The original white methadone district went away in the 1930s.
The black community, which prayed nearby, received the right to own the building.
St. Martin's Church was captured by the black community under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who presided over a boycott of merchants on the main shopping street in Harlem, 125th Street, where they refused to hire or promote magic.
The fire in 1939 left the building heavily damaged, but believers under the leadership of Johnson's father planned a reconstruction: they put the corals into operation.
Like David Johnson, Johnson’s father’s son and his successor in St. Martin’s Church, he proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert, who played the violin in July, called it "Cultural Treasure" and - "an irreplaceable historical tool".
Cifani Ng, an expert at Michigan University, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by black-skinned musician Daniel A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to the larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merivezer said that he had not been replaced in St. Martin's Church.
What has happened in the Church of St. Martin over the past few months has been a complex history between architects and counselors, some of whom have been attracted to false church leaders, others to the diocese.
The meeting of the faithful - the governing body of the arrival, which consists of the assistants of the chaplain, - wrote to the diocese in July with caution that the diocese "will try to translate the expenses" to the meeting of the faithful, although the meeting did not participate in the hiring of architects and architects.
Some of the visitors complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster hunting in California.
On Saturday, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was hunting for lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobsters' hunting season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near the beach of Bacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that Saturday morning he had been diving with friends for half an hour when he heard a boy yell, asking for help, and then swam with the others to help him.
At first, Hamel thought it was just a wake-up call from a lobster hunt, and then he “realized that something bad had happened: ‘I’ve been bitten!
I have been bitten!”
“His whole key was broken,” Hamel said, adding that he noticed it when he came to the boy.
I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: “In the water near the shark!” – added Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to Reggie's Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The variety of sharks that carried out the attack is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Jayles told a media briefing that the shark had been spotted at the site a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that it was a safe variety.
Jayles added that the victims suffered injuries to the upper part of the body.
Officials closed approaches to the beach from Ponta B<0xC3><0xAD>ch in Casablanca to Siva in Esinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and for safety.
Jayles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to move to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening departments with beauty goods in universities where trained specialists will work.
As part of a significant advance to the British beauty market with a turnover of 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow, while the volume of sales of fashionable clothing and household goods is decreasing, the more large beauty houses will still be in front of the 11th floor.
Investments in the field of beauty come because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill a place on shelves, which were previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's has said it will double the volume of beauty products, offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which will appear for the first time.
The existing assortment from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in company departments similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
Huge stores are also relaunching their line of boutique cosmetics, so most products will be suitable for vegans, and this trend is becoming increasingly popular among young shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume shop will test a concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in south London, and the second will open in Sali-Owk (Birmingham) at the end of this year.
Online shopping and the transition to buying small amounts of products every day in local stores around the house leads to the fact that the supermarket is forced to make more efforts to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Cupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, said that trading points will be increasingly similar in supermarkets, as a network of supermarkets is trying to compete with Aldi, Lidl's dispensaries with the help of more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos trading points in hundreds of stores, as well as several Habitats points since it acquired both networks two years ago, which, according to him, contributed to the increase in the sale of food products and wholesale products.
The previous attempt by supermarkets to reconstruct their departments of beauty and pharmacy did not end successfully. . . .
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but an attempt to split revenues from pharmacy stores ended after a series of breakdowns in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business three years ago along with the 281 store Celesio to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy network for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
It was announced that Lloyds had played its role in this regard by expanding the range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Commercial Director, said: "We have changed the appearance of our beauty salons to improve conditions for our customers.
We have also invested in the training of our employees, who will be able to offer their recommendations.
Our range of brands is designed with all the needs in mind, and the attractive setting and convenient location make us the best home of beauty that stands out against the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones broke up after Holly Wilauby gave up on the deal for <0xC2><0xA3>11 million worth of starlings.
The Dragons star, Den Peter Jones, has been torn apart after television host Holly Willaubbie quit the deal for <0xC2><0xA3>11 million with his brand, which specializes in the image of life, to focus on its new ITV and TV channels.
There's no time in Wilaube for a brand of goods for home and accessories Truly.
The business pair became similar to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old chief announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Wilauby has left the star of Dragon's Den, Peter Jones, who is now breaking up with his lucrative clothing business to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was upset when a "golden" girl on television admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe (Bakinghamshire), that her new deal would not be worth up to 1.5 cents.
The business was similar to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand and was doubled to double Wilauby's profits to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willawi announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK and headed to one of her holiday homes.
The source said: Truly, he was Holi's main friend.
It was her long-term future, which she will see in a couple of decades.
Her decision to leave the club has left all of the participants in total dissatisfaction.
No one wanted to believe what had happened on Tuesday, but it had to start dinner very soon.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse, full of goods, ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the leading This Morning, which is one of the most important British stars, can cost companies millions due to the huge investments in various commodities – from pillows and candles to pillows and household goods, and so on.
It could be the end of a long friendship.
Willa's mother and husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Johns and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Wilauby founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the board in March.
The couple rests together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television firm.
Wilauby will become a representative of the M&S brand and will replace her aunt McPartlin as the leading ITV “I am a celebrity”.
Last night, a source close to Johns said: “We will not comment on his case.”
A sincere conversation, “after which we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for his comments, which he considers “non-presidential” because it speaks favorably of the North Korean leader.
Why does President Trump have so much to say?
Trump said in his paranoid “dictator” voice.
“I don’t refuse anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was announced by Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have come to a standstill.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s leading diplomat, Lee An Ho, told the world leader at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North did not expect the “relevant demands” of the United States in response to the announcement.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at sustaining the pressure.
Trump has taken a much more optimistic position in his speech.
“We are building a very successful relationship with North Korea,” he said.
“It could have ended the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have a good relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the completion of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
“To be on the side of the president is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, we will already have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia have devastated the islands, killing hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake on Lambok Street, foreign non-governmental organizations said that they were unnecessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of Lamboco's population has been displaced, no national poverty has been declared, which is a necessary condition for international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases it was clear that they were not applying for international assistance, so it was a bit difficult,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is gathering a team to travel to the Pole, it is not yet clear whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopa, a representative of the National Agency for the Fight against Natural Disasters, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Pula to see if the international agency will be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite the earthquakes that are always experienced by Indonesia, the country is still well prepared for the desperation of nature.
Even though there were a number of shelters built in Achacha, there are hardly any other shore crossings.
The apparent lack of siren for a tsunami warning in Paul led to a greater number of casualties, although the warning was.
Even in the best of times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia has been a difficult task.
And the tragic events have complicated the logistics of the transfer.
The hospital ship, which was placed on Lambok Street to treat the victims of the earthquake, is approaching the Pole, but the road to a new place of poverty will take at least three days.
President Jok Vedoda has focused his pre-election campaign on improving the destroyed infrastructure of Indonesia and has spent money on auto-roads and railways.
But the lack of funding will haunt the Jock administration, as next year there will be new elections.
Mr. Jok also faces the pressure of continuing inter-confessional tensions in Indonesia, where representatives of the Muslim-majority take on more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands driven out of their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs take to the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
Watch: Daniel Starge from Liverpool beats the ball far against Chelsea in a match against Chelsea
Daniel Starge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League, equalling the number of the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Starge received a transfer from Jordan Shakira when they were about 30 meters away from the Chelsea goalkeeper, who led with a score of 1-0.
He made a fist with the ball to the left of himself before making a shot into a far-off bar.
The attempt ended with a shot high below the top bar, when the ball flew to the top right corner of the net.
As a result, the ball flew over the head of the Arisballaga Cape, which jumped right into the net.
“He just tried to get into this position to push the ball, and players like Shack have always tried to push as far forward as possible, so I just tried to win us as much time as possible,” Starge said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante running, I made a light pass, not thinking too much about it, and I just hit the ball.”
Chelsea went 1-0 at the start of the second half after Belgian star Eden Azar was killed in the 25th minute.
Attacking the "blues" in this match made the pass of Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> before returning to the half-back zone and running in the half of the field "Liverpool".
The man quickly found himself in the center of the field.
He then made an impact by handing the ball over to Azar to the goalkeeper.
Azar ran away to the defender and broke into the lower left corner near the far side of the left-wing guard Elisan Becker.
Liverpool are competing against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 o'clock on Wednesday at the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea meet Videoton at the UEFA Europa League at 3 a.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has increased to 832.
The death toll due to earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has risen to 832, the agency said on Sunday morning, according to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO).
At a press conference, the representative of the agency Sutopa Purvo Nugroh said that according to reports, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed as a result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 points, which occurred on Friday until 7 p.m.
The city of Pal<0xC3><0xBA>, where more than 380,000 people live, was engulfed by rubble of destroyed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after he was stabbed to death.
The investigation into the murder began this morning after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with gunshot wounds in the Grayson-Museum area on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called to speak to the people in the area who had seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I'd like to address anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead or saw or heard anything suspicious, and they'd ask for help.
I also call on all, in particular, taxi drivers, video recorders who may have taken some video, to contact us, as they may have information that is extremely important for our investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived near Birkenhead and was found in her own home.
The woman's friends came to the scene today to ask her where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are in the process of informing the nearest relatives of the victims.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson-Museus has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have informed him that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He lost his voice when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will take a few more hours before they are allowed to return.
The police explained to one person that the entire area is now a place of crime.
The woman was crying at the scene.
She said, “It’s so horrible.”
At 14:00 two police vans were in the fenced perimeter, another van was outside.
Several police officers were standing inside the perimeter, investigating a multi-storey building.
Anyone who has information should contact the police department <0x40>MerPolCC, call number 101, or contact the Criminal Police anonymously on number 0800 555 111, calling registration 247 from September 30.
Cromwell’s parliamentary statue has been the last century’s memorable blow in the case of a “rewriting of history”.
His removal would be a poetic justice for him, similar to the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, made by his fanatical Puritan followers.
“But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Cryk’s proposal as “stupid” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the course of the current debate on the dismantling of the statue, it was inevitable that the monument of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace would become the subject of these actions.
The iconoclasts of the English Civil Wars were neither commissioned nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the evil Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
William Ham Thornikroft's bright presentation of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century's thinking and part of the artist's historiography, which many believe should still be respected.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwells have been known by many since the end of the 19th century better than today, as a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation, the subject of a long-standing historical debate.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure who represents one of the sides of this confrontation.
His achievements as a Lord-Protector also deserve to be noted and respected.”
The death of a Chinese farmer led to the death of a Chinese farmer.
According to local media, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in the southwest of China.
“A man known only by his name, Yuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery and yellow blood, next to the wheat on the Lupanshuy market in the province of Guichov,” the South China Post reported on Sunday.
The pigeon was preparing to introduce the pigeon vaccine in a pigeon's pigeonhole on May 30, 2005, in China's Xinhai province.
It is reported that he, along with his uncle, on Wednesday came from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his uncle found him dead and saw that the door in the neighboring plumber had been opened.
He said that there was a large blood clot in the pigeon's bladder.
According to the report, the court-medical examination confirmed that the 550-kilogram gun had dislodged the farmer.
“My uncle’s legs were scratched and damaged,” said a cousin named Wu, according to the Guiyang Evening News.
A video from the surveillance camera showed that Yuan went to the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to John or his uncle.
The market leader told Evening News that the leak had been closed to prevent an attack on anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene of the incident.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the market administration are in talks about compensation for his death.
Although the cases when pigs attack people, they are rare, but they have been before.
Yes, in 2016, the swine attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts, as a result of which the man was seriously injured.
A decade earlier, a <0xC2><0xA3>650-pound lead had pressed the Welsh farmer to his tractor and held it until his wife shot the animal.
After a farmer from the state of Arag<0xC3><0xB3>n was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a stepping stone.
“They’re just ridiculous.
They're tough and very inquisitive... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the proper amount of respect,” he said.
The remnants of the hurricane “Roza” will bring heavy pouring rain to the southwest of the United States.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weaker because it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rose will bring flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
The speed of the Roses, a Category 1 hurricane, was 85 miles per hour at 5 a.m., according to the Eastern Time on Sunday, and it was recorded at 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
“Rose” is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific begins to form an area of low pressure, which is moving east, to the west coast of the United States. If on Monday "Roza" approaches the peninsula of Lower California in the form of a trachea, it is a trapezoidal
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of waste to some parts of Mexico.
Then a tropical wetland, which interacts with the incoming low-pressure area, in the coming days causes strong gussetes in the southwest.
In places from 1 to 4 inches of precipitation causes dangerous sudden floods, landslides and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to the fact that the number of precipitation places will reach 2-3 inches per hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the northwest, especially in most of the Arizona, between 2 and 4 inches of precipitation is expected.
Due to the decomposed areas of tropical rain, a sudden flood is possible, provided the conditions deteriorate rapidly.
It would be very undesirable to go out on foot in the desert due to the possibility of a threat of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rain can cause the canyons to turn into turbulent rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by gusts of wind and dust.
The incoming low-pressure area will bring places of heavy rain in part of the coast of Southern California.
Possible total wastes more than half a year can lead to a slight flow of garbage and make it a slippery road.
It will be the first of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before the rain will go everywhere at the end of Monday and on Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread in the area of Four Corners in the car and will continue to the Sierras.
In October, there may be strong temperature spikes in the United States, as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to a sharp change in temperature in the near future.
There is a good example of a sharp temperature drop in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City (Missouri state), and Amahai (Nebraska state), St. Louis and De Moyne (Aowe state), the temperature difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the long-term summer heat will try to strengthen and expand again.
It is expected that in many central and eastern states, the United States will begin a warm October with temperatures of 80 degrees - from the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees per car, which will be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern part of the U.S. before the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearings.
More than 20 million people on six television networks watched interesting testimony on Thursday at the Supreme Court in a case between Brett Kavan and Christina Blaise Ford, who accused him of sexual violence in the 1980s, which is thought to have been all over the world.
Meanwhile, the political confrontation is continuing, the prosecutors have suspended their regular programs for the benefit of the extraordinary news on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flayck for the FBI: it was a mistake, it was a mistake.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that the drunk Kavanaugh had grabbed her and tried to pull her clothes off at a high school dinner.
The coffee shop said in its public testimony that it was 100% sure that it was not.
More than 20.4 million people, which Nielsen reported on Friday, were likely looking at it.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available to other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And in Nielsen's company there are usually problems with the rating of the people who watch TV in the office.
For comparison: the size of the audience is the same as when playing in a play-off or an Oscar award.
“The Fox News channel, whose experts strongly supported Kavan’s appointment, ran all networks on average with 5.69 million viewers over the course of the day,” Nielsen said in a statement.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
The interest remained high even after the hearings.
Blake was the main figure of the drama on Friday.
After the office of a moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote in support of Kavan, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when protesters shouted at his address and when he tried to sneak up on the floor.
He was standing with his eyes down for a few minutes when he was being watched, and it was broadcast live on CNN's channel.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, “You have authority, and yet many women have been set free from her.”
Blake said his office published a statement, and said before the elevator closed, that he still had something to say in the committee's hearings.
All cable and broadband networks were broadcast live for several hours, when the Judicial Committee had to vote on the issue of the exclusion of Kavanaugh's candidacy in the Senate chamber.
But Blake said he would do so, only realizing that the FBI will consider the charges against the candidate next week, which is what Democrats are calling for from a minority.
Flack was convinced in part by talks with his friend, Senator-Democrat Chris Kuns.
After a conversation with the Council and a few senators, Flayk made the decision.
Flayka's choice was strong because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh in the FBI.
Britain's Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" because of Brexit <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices
During an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union, that they are "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In one of the interviews next to her on the front page of the newspaper was her former foreign minister Boris Johnson, who spoke out against her so-called "shashashasha" plan on Brexit, saying that the proposal to "not be Britain and E.C. Meli<0xC3><0xAB>l<0xC3><0xAB>" was the only one.
The murder of Wade Simms: Police have arrested a suspect in the death of LSU player Dayton Simpson.
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana team.
“20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been arrested and placed in jail on charges of second-degree murder,” the Batton Rouge police chief said in a statement.
Officials showed a video of the shooting between Sam and Simpson, and police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the shooting.
“The police took the glasses from the scene and said they had found Simpson’s DNA,” said WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had confessed to the shooting in Wade.
“The cost of the institution is set at the level of $350,000,” – reports Advocate.
The investigation of the Eastern Batan-Rouge administration published a previous report on Friday, which said that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department of Louisiana State Police's operating group, the state police's criminal lab, the South University Police are asking residents of the area for help in an investigation that would have contributed to the arrest.
Sports director of the University of Louisiana, Joe Alieva, thanked the district’s human rights body for “obedience and a quest for justice”.
Simmons was only 20 years old.
Attacking a 6-foot-tall grown up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the University of Louisiana team.
On average last season, he scored 5.6 points, 2.6 picks per game.
On Friday morning, coach of Louisiana University basketball team Will Wade said the team was "disappointed" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“That’s what I always worry about,” Wade said.
Volcano erupts ash in Mexico
The ash, which rises from the Papatepetl volcano, has reached the southern areas of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for the Prevention of Natural Disasters on Saturday proposed to Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity appeared in the crater and 183 cases of gas and smoke emissions were recorded for 24 hours.
There was a loud noise in the centre and a squeaky sound was heard.
Images on social media have shown that in the surroundings of Mexico, such as Sachimilka, there are thin layers of papyrus coating on the car windshield.
Geophysicists noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the south-east capital after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the year of the vote for independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after supporters of independence clashed with the police on the protection of the public order, and thousands of others joined the demonstration in commemoration of the first anniversary of the polarization of the country.
A group of separatists in masks, which were held by the police under the protection of the public order, left them with eggs and colored them with powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later that same day, the fighting broke out when the police used their rifles to hold down the demonstrators.
For several hours, a group of independence fighters who chanted “Don’t forget, don’t give”, faced the workers who were present, shouting: “Long live Spain”.
According to local media reports, fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries received in the course of the protest actions.
The tension in the region, which is seeking independence, remains high a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid has declared illegal, but which Catalan separatists have noted.
The majority of voters gave preference to independence, although the voter turnout was low, which was largely explained by the boycott of the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region as a result of the actions of angry demonstrators.
The group, which advocates for independence, spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of Spain's national police force.
The protest continued, but the protesters were forced to go the other way.
The 68-year-old Narcissus Termes, an electrician who attends a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes for the prospect of Catalonia's independence.
“This year we had one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now we’re tired,” he said.
Despite the vital, but minor victory in the regional elections in December of last year, the Catalan parties, which are in favor of independence, have tried hard to keep the momentum this year with many of their leaders and their leaders.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Jean Puch, who writes a protest in support of the police on the phone, said the conflict had been dealt with by politicians from both sides.
“It’s getting more and more stressful,” he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in SIZA since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“The election as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of the democratic values and repressions that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after being smuggled into a house in a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car repeatedly crashed into a house in London.
The incident took place in the Belignard-Cressent area on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said the door and the building itself had been damaged.
At some point, the car may have been hit by a bullet.
As a result of Mang’s strike, “Livingstan” gets a victory over the Rangers with a score of 1:0
Doli Manga's first goal in favor of "Livingstan" ensured them victory
The success of "Livingston" earned praise from the Rangers, and this was enough to appoint Stephen Gerard after his several injuries in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mangy's hit was great, as Gary Holt climbed to a level with the Hibernian in the second division.
Gerard's team this season won't win on a trip to the Premier League and next Sunday will meet with the leaders, the Harts team, who are eight points behind.
To this end, the Rangers in the Europa League will host the Swedish Rapids on Thursday.
"Livingstan", meanwhile, continued its unbeaten series in the division of up to six games, and head coach Holt still feels a parachute after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
"Livingstan" misses the chance due to rough visitors
Holt's team had to warn long before they killed, but the same direction caused the Rangers a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke up, but lost his chance to kill in the gate, after which Alan Lithow was only able to direct his way wider to meet Craig Halket's blow.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could disturb the guests at some point.
And that's how the main goal was achieved.
On the part of the Rangers was allowed a penalty kick, and "Livingstan" made his debut, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to defeat Meng, who made a pass and killed out of the center of the field.
Up to this point, Rangers dominated, but it turned out that the team's defense was unfavourable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was virtually uninvolved.
The same thing happened in the second half, though Alfredo Marelas actually saved Kelly.
The ball from Scott Pitman was fired by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and the Lithos left far away from the second set of "Livingston".
Balls were constantly thrown into the gates of "Livingstan" and were abated, while the two demands of the penalty, after Halket was called in for Glenn Middleton's replacement, and the demand for a penalty for the game by hand, were rejected.
“The Phenomenon” from “Livingstan” – analysis
BBC Scotland journalist Alessandro Lamant on Arena Tony Macaroni
Phenomenal productivity and results for «Livingstan».
For the men, they were wonderful, continuing to exceed expectations on this up-and-coming trajectory.
Their style of play and composition have practically not changed since the moment of their return to the higher echelon, but it is worth paying the proper tribute to Holt for how he encouraged the team from the moment of his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was grandiose, building a well-organized defense, while Menga held Conor Goldson and Joe Warala everywhere on the field.
The Rangers didn’t have any inspiration.
No matter how good they were at Gerhard, they didn't meet these standards.
In the last match, they did not own the ball, only once beating the gate, which was something like a distress call for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the list.
A mixed view of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29th, smiles were seen and groundless airstrikes were felt when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They argued over the human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EC.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an set out to Cologne to open a new giant ball.
This city has the largest number of Turkish population living outside of Turkey.
Police have resorted to security considerations so as not to allow a crowd of 25,000 people to gather in front of the ball, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their opinion, condemning both Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
Protests for and against the protest reflect disagreements about the guest, which some German Turks declared a hero, and others condemned as an autocrat.
DTZ in Deptfard: Ravarrist killed in collision with car
The driver died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a bustling road in Deptfard, in the south-east of the city, at about 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped, the doctors arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident took place a few months after another rower died as a result of a collision on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of a Saturday accident.
The police said their employees were working to get to know the man and report him to their nearest relatives.
There are parking lots and bus stops near the place, and the motorists were advised to avoid this area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six employees injured during riots in the city
“Six prison officials were injured as a result of irregularities in the prison of a strict regime for men,” – reports the Penitentiary Administration.
The riots broke out in Long Lartsin prison in the U.S. government around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and continue to this day.
In order to combat the riots, in which participants of the eight prisoners in one wing are involved, was attracted to the Tarnada special group.
At the scene of the incident, the staff underwent treatment for minor injuries.
A representative of the Penitentiary Service said: “The specially trained prison staff was directed to fight against those who had committed inadvertently in the prison “Long Lartsin”.
Six of the patients were treated after receiving treatment for their injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the culprits will be handed over to the police and may spend more time behind bars.”
The royal prison "Long Lartsin" contains more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison underwent treatment in the hospital after the attack of the prisoner.
And in October last year, police officers on the defense of the public order were called to the prison to deal with serious disagreements, during which the employees were attacked with balls for the airfield.
Hurricane Rosa threatens the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with strong floods (which can be beneficial for drought-affected regions)
Tropical hurricanes rarely occur in Arizona, but this is exactly what can happen at the beginning of next week, because there are traces of the Rosa hurricane in the southwestern part of the desert, which pose a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already published data on the sudden floods in western Arizona and in southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern California, and Utah on Monday and Tuesday, including in Fethiye and Fethiye.
It is expected that in the morning "Rosa" will go straight through the Phoenix, approaching with the rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or a drop of pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the border with the state of Arizona.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts precipitation from 2 to 4 inches, while in some places the level can reach 6 inches in the area of Magalion in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall from 1 to 2 inches, while the individual result values can reach 4 inches.
For those who are out of the danger of sudden flooding, Hurricane Rosa could be long-awaited, as their region suffers from drought.
Although the flooding is a very serious problem, some of these waterfalls are likely to be useful, as droughts are currently being observed in the southwest.
According to data from the U.S. drought monitoring agency, at least a little more than 40 percent of the territory of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought of the second category,” – reports weather.com.
First of all, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to a landslide in the Mexican victory of Lower California.
On Sunday morning, the Rose still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour at 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, and so it will drown.
Thus, it is expected that in Mexico, when a tropical storm strikes, the river will be released from the shores by day or by night on Monday.
Rainfall in different parts of Mexico can be strong, which creates a significant risk of flooding.
“The total number of falls is expected to range from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to North-West Sunny, where possible falls to 10 inches,” – reports weather.com.
Then the "Red" will move north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning on Tuesday in the form of a tropical drop in pressure, which will then continue the movement through Arizona and the southern part of the state to the south.
“The main danger is expected from the Rose or its remnants, it’s a very strong rain in Lower California and in the northwest of Sanora and the southwestern desert of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and rural floods and landslides in the mountainous locality.
The attack on Midsamer North: four attempts to arrest the killers
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with multiple stab wounds in Somerset.
Three teenage boys have been found injured in the terrace area of Exelsier in Midsummer North at about 4 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in a “stable” state.
“A 17-year-old boy and two others, 18- and 20-year-olds, were arrested overnight in Redstock, Avon and Somerset,” police said.
The police have appealed to anyone who could have any evidence on a mobile phone of what happened to move forward in their search.
“Cavanaugh is appalling at the power and anger of the Democratic Party,” Trump said.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the abolition of the ruthless and aboriginal tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wiling, Eastern Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "suffering from the power and anger" of the Democratic Party during the process of his removal to office.
Kavanaugh gave testimony before Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally rejecting Christine Blaise Ford's accusations that she had sexually assaulted her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also made statements during the hearings about her allegations.
On Saturday, the President said that “on this day, the Americans saw the brilliant, quality and brave character” of Kavanaugh.
“The vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for one of the most perfect experts in the field of the law of our time, a lawyer with an excellent history of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The President has recently referred to the withdrawal of the Kavanaugh, talking about the importance of the Republican leadership in the interim elections.
“Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections of our time.
I’m not just late, I’m really late,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for the big candidates everywhere.”
Trump disagrees that the Democrats intend to “oppose and hinder.”
“It is expected that the first key procedural vote at the Senate level after the withdrawal of Kavanaugh will take place no later than Friday,” said CNN’s senior assistant to the parliament’s leadership.
Hundreds of people have died as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims is growing.
“At least 384 people were killed, many people disappeared as a result of the influx of giant waves on the beaches when a massive earthquake and tsunami began on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi,” the government said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Pau on Friday, when they boasted a height of six meters (18 feet) lying on the shore in the rubble, killing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
Following the earthquake, a 7.5-magnitude tsunami occurred.
“When there was a tsunami threat yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately escape, and they became victims,” Sutopo Purvo Nurhoro, a press secretary for the Indonesian disaster relief agency, told a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunamis were driven by cars, drones, houses, hitting everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km / h (up to 497 miles / h) before hitting the shoreline.
According to him, some people survived just because they got up on the trees to escape from the tsunami.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Pal.
The aerial photographs, published by the agency of natural disasters, showed that many of the buildings and shops were destroyed, the masts twisted and disintegrated, and the ball was surrounded by water.
The next storm continued to rock the nearby city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes took place in the area with a population of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Utilization Agency (BPPT) said the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
According to him, the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroha called the damage "wide" and reported that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
“The sacrifices and damage may be greater along the coastline at 300 km (190 miles) north of the Pole, an area called Dongal, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake,” said Nugrokh.
“The connection to Dongal was completely damaged,” said Nugrokh.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were directed to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it could have been a lot worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting on the tsunamis in Palo, but officials say the rumors came at a time when a warning was made.
In the amateur photos, published on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting out to people on the street a warning about the impending tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the water wall fell to the shore, dragging buildings and cars behind it.
Reuters was not able to immediately confirm the authenticity of the removed material.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused a serious shutdown of electricity, which broke communications around the Pole, so it was difficult for the authorities to recall rescue actions.
According to the authorities, the soldiers began to direct cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still very much needed food and other items of first need.
The city's airport has been opened only for assistance and will be closed until October.
On Sunday, President Jok Vida planned to visit the evacuation centers in Pal.
As a result of the tsunami in Indonesia, more than 800 people were killed.
It's very bad.
“While World Vision employees from Danggal successfully traveled to the city of Pal, where the workers are hiding in the explosive shelters installed in the courts of their offices, they saw scenes of devastation along the way,” said Mr. Doseba.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began to take a dark turn on the launch of disaster relief mechanisms, some complained that foreign workers, who possess deep knowledge, were being prevented from going to the Pole.
According to the Indonesian rules, funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to act if the place of poverty is declared a zone of national poverty.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Auliya Arriani, the press secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, “Okay, this is a national disaster,” we will be able to open up to international aid, but this status is not yet there.
On the second night in Paul, after an earthquake and a tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing had hoped that their near-miracles would be among those who would leave the unsatisfying storylines of the stagnant poverty.
On Saturday, the little boy was released from the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days, and next to her was the body of her child.
Gendon Subandon, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, has prepared two of the missing paraglidings for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandaga, including the others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, were his students.
“Being the oldest in the field of paraplanarism, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that a few hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel's demolition spread among the community of paragliders, he sent messages to WhatsApp participants at the beach, who were on the beach.
His messages, however, were marked by a series of throats, not two blue ones.
“This means that messages have not been sent,” he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 during the replenishment of ATMs in Newport, Lew
“This morning on Friday, the thief stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who had deposited a bank account in a bank in Newport, Libya,” the Newport Police Department said in a press release.
“The driver of the car knocked down the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money,” – wrote Det. Denis McCarthy in the release.
While he was busy, another man "escaped from the Brink's worker" and hid the fur from the sin intended for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses noticed several suspects who left the scene of the incident, but the police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their personalities should contact the Newport Police Department by phone 859-292-3680.
Kenny West: Rapper changes his name to Ye ("you").
The rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
After announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "I'm officially known as Kenny West.
West, 41 years old, by the nickname Ye, used this nickname as the name for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes take place on the eve of his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande for the show, which has been cancelled for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
In addition to shortening his current professional name, West has previously said that this word has a religious meaning for him.
I believe that “ye” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it’s “you,” West said earlier this year, discussing the album’s name with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm you, I'm us, all of this is us
It went from “Kaine,” which means “one,” to simply “Ye” — a reflection of our good, our bad, our loss, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was otherwise known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he was referring to the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-worker, Jay-Z, also happened without a date and headlines.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use the army against the peaceful residents of Mexico
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Abrador has vowed never to use military force against the civilian population, as the country is approaching its 50th anniversary since the day of a bloody crackdown on students.
On Saturday, at Tlatelolco Plaza L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Abrador promised “never to use the military to subdue the Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, the military launched a peaceful demonstration on an area that killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements swept through Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Abrador has promised to support young Mexicans by issuing monthly subsidies to those who are studying, opening up the most free places in state-run universities.
“Unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups,” he said.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for automotive intelligence.
“As China becomes more and more active in the field of machine intelligence, the U.S. must double the amount it spends on research in this field,” says Microsoft’s investor and machine intelligence specialist, Kaifu Lee, who works at Google.
The comments came after different parts of the U.S. government made statements about MI, even if the U.S. lacks an official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year, China presented its plan: by 2030, it will try to be the first in the field of MI innovations.
“The budget for research in the MI region would be a good start, given that all other countries are leaving the United States, and we are waiting for the next breakthrough in the MI region,” Lee said.
“Financing can double the likelihood that the next major achievement of AI will be achieved in the U.S.,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Overseas of Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Kharkurt, is the Chief Executive Officer of the company Sinovation Ventures, which is the CEO of the company.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie-Melancholy he worked on a system of machine intelligence, which won the highest-ranking American player Attel, and later he was the head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged the previous ruling U.S. technological competition, such as the Agency's robotics competition for a pioneering research project in the field of defense, and asked if it would be the next one to help determine the next.
“U.S. investigators often have to work hard to get state grants,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have been hiring headlights from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said a change in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the area of machine intelligence (MI).
“In my opinion, green cards should automatically be offered to a candidate in the field of MI,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued a plan for the development of the next generation of machine intelligence.
“The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in educational institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other state-run organizations allocate money to researchers of the United States, but the quality of the Academy of Sciences.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the United Center for Machine Intelligence, in which partners from industry and science circles should participate, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Machines.
And this month, according to a preliminary research project in the field of defense, the Agency announced investments in the amount of $2 billion called AI Next.
As far as the National Science Organization (NSF) is concerned, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in the MI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation, which sought to establish the National Machine-Intellectual Security Commission, has not monitored the actions for several months.
Macedonia voted in a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change their name to "North Macedonia", which will allow to resolve a ten-year dispute with Greece, which has blocked applications for participation in the SAA and the European Union.
Greece, which has the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed the accession of NATO and EC.
In June, the two governments signed a deal with the proposed new name, but nationalist workers claim that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Georgiy Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott company questioned whether the voter turnout would correspond to a minimum of 50 percent required for the referendum to be held.
The question of voting in the referendum suggests: “You are for membership in NATO and EC with the adoption of an agreement with Greece”.
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price that should be paid for admission to bodies such as EC and NATO Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivier Georgievska.
Although this is not an obligatory legal force, a sufficient number of members of parliament have stated that they will take into account the results of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name will require more than two-thirds of parliament.
The state election commission said that no reports of the violations had been received until 1 o'clock.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when it voted for 66 percent of registered voters.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Jose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in Skopje’s capital.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zaritsa and his son Dushka voted for a referendum in Macedonia, dedicated to changing the name of the country, which will open the way for her accession to NATO and the European Union, in March 2018, in Struma.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and arranged chairs in front of tents set up by those who will be riding a referendum.
“We are behind NATO and the EU, but we want unity with the heads raised, not through the official doors,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have the honor.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO's friendship will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will be ‘for’ because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the result of “yes” would be “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research of Macedonia, it is said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum, which is below the necessary threshold.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's TV channel, showed 57 percent of the respondents, who are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they voted “yes.”
For a successful referendum, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western government's policy since its arrival in May last year.
Watch: Sergey Agueira from Manchester City passes to the gate through the entire defence of Britannia
On Saturday, Sergey Aguera and Rahim Sterling solved the problem with defending against Britain by winning Manchester City with a score of 2:0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
In the 65th minute, Aguirre easily did so.
The Argentine striker received a post in the center of the field.
He fought between the three defenders of Britain, before being beaten in the open field.
At the time, Aguero was among the four green horses.
He went to one defenseman and sacked several more in the country of the British field.
Then he shoved the post onto the left flank, finding Sterling.
The English attacking first touch in the penalty gave the ball to Aguero, who used his right blow to bypass the goalkeeper of the "Britain" Matt Ryan by hitting the right part of the net.
“Aguera has some problems with her legs,” Pep Guardiola, the city’s mayor, told reporters.
“We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the same time.”
But it was Serling who gave Sky Blues the initial lead in the fight in the Premier League.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Agueira got this ball in the depth of the territory of "Britain".
He sent a beautiful ball through the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sean made a few touchdowns before Sterling was able to get to the far side of the bar.
Assaulting Sky Blues, he pointed the ball into the net before he jumped out of the line.

Sherzer wants to play the role of "choice point" against Roki
After the Nationals were excluded from the competition in the play-offs, there was no particular reason to forge a new start.
But the constantly competitive Sherter hopes to take a hit on Sunday against "Calalade Rockies", but only when there will still be consequences of play-off for the Rockies, who remain in the leaders after one game with "Los Angeles Dodgers."
The years have won at least one place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still hope to get their first title in the division.
"Even though we're playing just like that, at least we can handle the situation, knowing that the atmosphere here, in Denver, with the crowd and other team will be so that the game will probably be at the highest level, this will be at the highest level.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have not yet announced the start of Sunday, but are reportedly willing to give Sherlock the ball in such a situation.

Trump's speech in West Virginia
The president has recently referred to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano, speaking about the importance of the Republicans' voice in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It’s one of the big, big ones – I’m not late, but I’m really late, so I’m everywhere fighting for the big candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see what’s happening right now.
And they are full of determination to regain power, using whatever means are necessary, you see, - property, vanity.
They don’t care who they blame, who they have to defeat in order to get power and control, that’s what they want, that’s power and control that we’re not going to give them.”
According to him, the Democrats intend to “oppose and hinder.”
“And you’ve seen this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil, evil, reverse, and false.”
He was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the previous recognition of Democratic Group Senator Diana Feynstein, who received a loud rating from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
You've let go of the document?
Uh-oh, what?
No, I’m not waiting — it was a very bad nonverbal language — a worse language I’ve ever seen.”
Work is no longer the foundation of the church.
It's an impatience to those who express their opinions.
If I'm a member of my local community, it's not a surprise to me that I've been hurt.
In the end, I am the last of a number of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party who are told that we are not welcome – all to express my opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar turnaround because she strongly opposed antisemitism.
In my case, the censorship criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on the irony of fate, similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The report of the meeting, which was held on Friday by the Nottingham Eastern Labour Party, says that "we want these meetings to be substantive and productive", said the statement.
For most of my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Labour Party, this was the kind of meeting that took place on Friday.
Unfortunately, today, for the most part, the tone is not the same and the promise of a "better, softer" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever was.
It becomes increasingly obvious that in a Labour party different views are not allowed, and every opinion is assessed from that side of the mind, whether it is acceptable for party leadership or not.
It started soon after Jeremy became the leader, because the peers with whom I previously thought I was sharing the same political views, started to wait for me to take a step back, and I took a position with which I would have no regrets.
Every time I speak out in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – there’s a tyranny on social media that calls for an election to be cancelled, condemning the centre’s policy, saying that I’m no longer in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I was more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me, as a rule, are political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who encounter the flow of sexual or racial prejudices on a daily basis, but never give up.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuses.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer an organization that adheres to different views, and with each movement of “uncertainty” or a change in the rules of the party’s election becomes higher.
Over the past two years, I've been given a lot of advice that has called me not to go down in the spirit, not to be so loud, and then everything will be okay with me.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolgirl in charge of the kidnapping of the Tether government, because of which my schooling was done in a school-literate manner, I have tried to defend the best public services for those who are suffering the most.
I've never had to hide my political views, including in the last election.
No one in the East Nottingham could ever get lost in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership. . . . .
For those who fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is headed for Brexit, which is hurting the landlord, the enterprise and our public service, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my faith.
But in fact, the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it's my constituents, whether they'll be members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud of serving you, and I promise that there will be no threat of cancellation of the elections in the past year.

Air-Mellows 38 - 17: Invincible Air at the Top
Two later attempts, perhaps, several told the final result, but, without a doubt, Air deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Premier League match of Tennant.
Now they're appointing a tournament table, the only side out of ten.
In the end, it was their highest defense, as well as their best chances, which made them the hosts, coach Peter M<0xC3><0xBC>nchy had the full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve still tried our games so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Give proper air, he's braver than we are."
The 14-minute attempt by Grant Anderson, transformed by Fraser Klima, put Aira in the foreground, but the yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, received for the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to compete with the numbers, and for the non-Jayson Baggies.
Climaov extended the leadership of the Air with the help of a penalty, before, directly at the break, he killed, and then made a solo attempt, making 17-5 of the Air at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, transformed by Bagot, reduced the distance to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious injury Ruarid Nott, which was extended, and after a re-start, Air moved on through the attempt of Stafard McDowell, the accomplished Klima.
Air, performing the duties of Captain Blair McFarlane, received a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another man to pay with the help of an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the February pressure.
However, the hosts came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for beating the Klimas without a ball from the penalty line, McFersan landed behind the Air.
Klimaw made his attempt, which he did again almost after a restart, after Kyle Rowe received a blow from David Armstrong in the penalty box and sent the flanker Gregory Henry to the fifth try by the field hosts.
Still Game star seems to be ready for a new career in the restorative business
However, the star of the Ford Kieran game is about to enter the hospitality business industry after it was discovered that it had been appointed by the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular show, which he writes, and is filmed with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth series would be the final in the show series, and it seems that Kernan plans to move on after Craigslist.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kernan hopes to take part in the "flowering trade in Glasgow".
"Our Sea": Bali, which has no access to the sea, hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The Moroccans are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Civilian buildings under the blue flags.
In military-marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto "Our Sea on the Right" is drawn.
Restoring is our duty.
In all of Bali, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody conflict due to the resources of the 19th century, is still alive – as is the attempt to swim again on the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached a peak in the past decade, as Bali is awaiting an international court decision on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Balvia has an impulse, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course, it is waiting for a positive outcome,” said the Bolivian diplomat, Robert Kalsadlya.
Many Balinese will be watching the decision of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague after decades of tense talks will support the statement by Bolivia that the Chili have been obliged to hold negotiations on the sale of the land.
Eva Mar<0xC3><0xA1>les is the charismatic president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial struggle for re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly make a decision in favor of Bali, and that will change little, even if it does.
The UN, which is based in the Netherlands, has no right to take a decision on the territory of Chile and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice comes out only six months after the final arguments were considered, testifies that the case was “not complicated,” said the Chilean expert in the field of international law Paz Zarate.
And without furthering the affairs of Bali, the last four years, perhaps, have left it behind.
“The problem of access to the sea has been manipulated by the current Balinese administration,” Sarat said.
According to her, the warrior rhetoric of Marales has lost the rest of Chile's well-being.
Bali and Chili will continue to talk, but after that it will be very difficult to hold a discussion.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged messages.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltez, the representative of Bali in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bali will have “a unique opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “deal the end of 139 years with mutual benefit,” he said.
Kalsadlya also denied that Mar<0xC3><0xA1>les – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – used the maritime problem as a political support.
“Bali will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome in the past.”
North Korea says it will not be able to deploy nuclear weapons until it is able to trust the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Roy Yong Ho, said his country would never stop using its nuclear weapons until it could trust Washington to do so.
Roy made his speech at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two countries.
His comments come as the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, apparently, is on the verge of restoring a nuclear stupid diplomacy with North Korean Kim Jong Un more than three months after Singapore.
Rye says it is an "unforgettable goal" to keep the U.S. sanctions and its stand against the declaration of the end of the Korean War ever put the North on its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree to a declaration if Pyongyang does not at first launch significant steps to de-escalation.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are calling for a second summit to be held.
But there's a lot of skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang is seriously considering a withdrawal from the arsenal, which the country is probably considering as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit of Kim-Trump.
At the Paris Fashion Shows we saw the newest line in the massive headwear on the way to the store in your cities.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely close the sun, you can no longer search.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have presented on the podium a host of unusual headwear for their SS19 collection, which has exceeded the expectations of Paris Fashion Week.
This summer on Instagram was won by the popularity of impractical hats, designers of which sent their creations to the podium.
The distinctive feature of Valentino was a luxurious beige chapel, embellished with wide poles, similar to the feathers that filled the heads of the models.
Other accessories of an unusually large size included carved gemstones of the coffin, a magician's chapel and even pineapple, but they were not intended to keep their heads warm.
However, Brown also showed a selection of mudragelist masks – just to Halloween.
Many of the various-coloured masks were with sewn lips and resembled Ganibala Lecter more than high fashion.
One of them resembled a snorkel for underwater swimming with pipes and protective glasses, and the other – similar to the melted cone of ice cream.
And if you continue to adhere to the great attributes of fashion, you're in luck.
Those who follow the style, predict that huge chapels can break into our daily lives. . . .
Hats of large size go on the fifth to "La Bomba", a salami hat with poles wide in two feet, which can be seen in all, from Ryan to Emily Rataykovsky.
The cult label for a very uncomfortable hat, which was released on social networks, spurred on yet another big creature on the podium – a salami beach bag, almost as big as a model with this bag, dressed in a bathing suit.
A dark-orange bag made of raffia, tinted with raffia lace and covered with white leather handle, became an integral part of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, as the designer has had a big impact, and it would be hard to ignore the demand for non-smokers.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland retain achievements in academic success, it continues from 2018 with yet another excellent result of the exams, which is reinforced by individual and collective success in the contest, the arts, music and other fields.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are striving to ensure a better level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their students for the further higher education, their chosen career and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “When you talk to a man in a language he understands, it stays in his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.”
It's a vivid reminder that we can't rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of this year's final exams, we see that languages occupy the first place in league tables with the highest scores in independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of the students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade of A.
The data, collected in 74 schools participating in SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade A in Chinese language learning, while 72 percent – those who also studied German, 69 percent – were learning German, and 69 percent were learning English.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a vitally important skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Now languages as an subject are selected in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the academic programs of independent schools and elsewhere.
The survey, conducted by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014, showed that among the reasons that employers brought about in connection with the difficulties in filling the vacancies, 17 percent of the respondents were related to the lack of mobility.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming a necessity in order to prepare young people for future careers.
Given the more promising jobs that require knowledge of languages, these skills are becoming necessary in a globalized world. . . .
No matter which profession you choose, if you learn a different language, in the future it will be a real advantage if you have such skills for a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the multi-lingual person in the first place among the competitors.
According to a survey by YouGov, in which more than 4,000 adult Britons participated in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak well enough in a foreign language to speak, and French was the only language in which a two-digit percentage – 15 percent spoke.
That's why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
The presence of several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the languages that are taught in it.
A number of schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK with a view to the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interest is, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with a teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools will strive to provide an environment of learning that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to achieve success, regardless of what is going to happen in the future.
At the present time, it can not be denied that in the global business environment language still has a vital importance for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as “skills of international relations.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and preference for young people in Scotland.
This has to be done
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron debuts on Sunday in San Diego
The start of the wait for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start in the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Waltan has announced that James is playing at a pre-season opening on Sunday against Denver Nights in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's playing is still to be determined.
“This will be more than one and less than 48,” Waltan said on the Lakers official website.
Mike Trudel, the Lakers' chief executive, wrote that James is likely to play in a limited amount of minutes.
According to the practice, which took place this week, James was asked about his plans for the “six game pre-season schedules.”
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Trump's speech time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight, in Willingen, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaigns for the company.
This is the first of Trump's five planned speeches next week, including stops in friendly places, Tennessee, and Mississippi.
With the confirmation of the vote on the arrival of the elections to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump will try to strengthen the support of the incumbents of the interim elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of the Govt.
When does Trump's speech start tonight in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Trump's speech in Wiling, West Virginia, scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's performance in West Virginia on the Internet below in a live stream on YouTube.
Trump, most likely, this week will consider hearings on a candidacy at the Brett Kavanaugh High Court, which has problems on the grounds of charges in sexual harassment with the expected confirmation in the Senate voting for a week in a row.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to provide assistance to the republicans, who stand before the elections in November.
Thus, the company of President Trump announced that these five speeches next week are aimed at "activating the activities of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to defend and expand the majority of them, and the majority of them are in the process of expanding.
“Control over Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible, as we are entering the tense season of the pre-election campaign,” Trump’s spokesman told Reuters.
Planned at the Wesbanco Arena in Wilinga, today’s event could attract fans from Aga<0xC3><0xAF> and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media,” reports The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, a state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate in the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morris, who is the leader in the polls.
“It’s not a very good sign for Morris that the president should come to try and give him a hint in the polls,” said Simon Hedar, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team is moving forward to fight to keep hope alive on Sunday
After three one-on-one sessions on Saturday, perhaps that's exactly what it took for this Ryder Cup.
The owner of the momentum that is going on is a completely invented sports concept, in which the players sincerely believe, and nothing more than similar competitions.
So where would they say the impulse now?
“They had a six-point advantage, and now four, so I think we’re going through it with a little bit of momentum,” Jordan Sleepy said, walking for the day.
Europe's advantage, of course, is four points ahead, and in the game another twelve.
The Americans, as Spith says, feel like they've been slightly blown by the wind, and they have something to hope for, not least, because of the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and everyone can hang out.
The spot has been deadly from football to green and is an example of this.
These gargantuan cries of celebration became louder as his round lasted, and he suffered a decisive blow to play in the match on four fields when they and Thomas came down two to two.
His strike, which allowed them to win in the match of 15, was met with a similar cry, like the one that tells you that he believes that the American team is not ruled out.
“You just have to go deeper and worry about your own game,” Spicy said.
All of these players have already left.
18 points to make a mark.
In the last two days, the only players who have earned more points than Spot and Thomas are the Francisca Molinara and Tommy Flitwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
Strange, but charming couples in Europe four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Maldives" were the only couple who did not make the gods on Saturday, the second half of the day, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, Friday and the second half of the day on Friday.
It happens, and how their energy, like, runs to and from this turbulent crowd, and it confirms that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there would not be a more popular player to close the potential win at the Golf Club in Europe.
Both are desired at the same time in different locations.
The debate on the European Union's reputation is still going on.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short work on Sergey Garcia, the hero of the morning furthest when he was with Alex Noran.
The gods and the two twins in the previous nine rescued him from Spain and Sweden, from which they were never able to get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your lunch.
For matches of four balls and fours it is so interesting to watch carefully because of the interaction between the composition of the pairs, the order they give, the order they do not perform, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has so far become a better team and has taken on a significant role in the last day, but at this fourth meeting it is also shown that the U.S. team is striving to fight, in which some have doubted, especially in the United States.
Europe are entering the final of the Ryder Cup with a score of 10-6
Europe will get a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and four-ball matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired by the duo of Tommy Flitwood and Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Mallinara, the two-way victory over Tiger Woods has been set to take the results at Le Golf National to four points.
European side Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, trying to save the trophy they lost in Hazeltsin two years ago, dominated the U.S. agency's dissatisfaction in the morning, receiving a 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more opponents in a four-ball game, winning two games, but they couldn't do more.
In order to save the trophy, Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday.
Flintwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row, and he and Mallinara, who got the name Molliwood after the sensational outings, are just the second pair to win four points in their first four games.
By breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they're wonderfully solidified to beat down Woods and U.S. contender Brian Decombe 5 and 4.
Woods, who made his debut in two games on Saturday, showed a random burst of lightning, but now he has lost 19 of 29 times in four-ball and four-quarter and seven-match matches.
Justin Rose, who rested on the x games of the four balls, returned to partner Henryk Stanson in the games of the four balls before the 2 & 1 parachute Dastina Johnson and Brooks Coepka – occupying one and the other place in the world.
Europe did not have its way, although it was a pleasant, fresh day south of the west of Paris.
On Saturday, the three-time major winner Jordan Spot and Justin Thomas set a two-point control point for the Americans.
They won 2 and 1 over John Ram and Ian Pulter from Spain in a four-ball game and returned later to defeat Puller and Rory McLean 4 and 3 in the quarter-finals, losing two aways.
Only twice in the history of the Cup, the Ryder team returned from a four-point deficit that goes alone, although the owners of Furyk only need to paint to save the trophy.
However, after the next two days, which were the best, the counterattack on Sunday looks like they'll get everything done.
North Korea says it will not “in any way” disarm in a unilateral order without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said that on Saturday the United Nations is continuing sanctions that strengthen distrust of the United States, and under such conditions the country can not refuse nuclear weapons in the same way.
Ryu Yun Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Body that last year North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill", for example, the cessation of testing on nuclear and missile sites, the dismantling of the nuclear testing zone and the nuclear testing zone.
“But we don’t see a proper response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way in the first place to unilaterally disarm ourselves.”
Despite the fact that Ri republished the usual North Korean complaints against Washington's "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea was rewarded, as it did not take gradual steps to decriminalize it, he said.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump on the first in the history of the summit of the President of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on the path to the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula".
North Korea has been trying to officially end the Korean War from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the call for the lifting of tough international sanctions in relation to North Korea.
“The United States of America first insists on “denuclearization” and increasing the level of pressure with the help of sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, and even opposes “the end of the war – the end of the war.”
“The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an unforgettable dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader noted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the participants in this issue of denuclearization were not South Korea, then South Korea, not South Korea.
However, the tone of the speech Ri was sharply different from last year when he spoke at the UN General Assembly claiming that the targeting of the U.S. mainland with the help of North Korea's missiles was inevitable after the name "Mr. Zappa".
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that there was still much more to be done, and sanctions should remain in place.
Trump said he doesn’t have a time frame for this, saying, “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are discussing at the UN. The Security Council has said that it is worth rewarding Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, Secretary of the United States. Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “Execution of sanctions of the Security Council should be actively and necessarily continued until we have confidence in the full, final and final resolution.”
The Security Council stepped up sanctions against North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, the report said.
Pompeo met with Ri in the colors of the Security Council. The General Assembly then said that in the following month he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a success.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that the progress made with North Korea over the course of several hours of talks had ended with a statement to the vice president that he was predicating demands “like gangsters”.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to eliminate the missile installation and nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures”.
Trump said that, according to Kim, the "appropriate measures" he is waiting for are a guarantee of security and an attempt to normalize relations with Washington, which Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard's students are taking a course on proper rest.
Harvard University's new course this year should teach students to sleep more, and aims to fight the culture of learning at night with coffee in hand.
The scientist concluded that students at one of the best universities in the world often do not know how to properly care for themselves and their health.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspired by a talk about the impact of lack of sleep on learning, he started the course.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, “Why did I just say that now, in the last lesson?”
“She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep – it surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course, taught by students, explains why good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic achievement, as well as improve the overall mood.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health care department, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding out that students are often out of school.
The course, which lasts an hour, involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a room on the Internet, where students click on cups of coffee, blankets and books that tell about the effects of caffeine and light and how a lack of sleep affects the sports indicators, as well as the importance of exercise.
At the full stage, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive images, invites participants to think about their daily lives.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we think that they need to know this as well as everyone knows about the consequences of smoking for health,” Professor Chaisler added.
According to him, the culture of the evenings still exists, adding that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students lead to sleep deprivation, which is becoming an ever-increasing problem.
“Enhanced adequate good quality sleep should be a ‘secret weapon’ for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety,” he said, “even to avoid excess weight, since sleep deprivation makes the brain a brain drain.”
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian student who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaser in developing the course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to teach everyone on campus.
He hopes that the next step will be a request for all students to complete a similar program of study before entering the university.
Professor Chaisler recommended that students have the opportunity to set a watch to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up, aware of the harmful consequences of the "blue light", which is radiated from the monitors screens and the LEDs behind the lamp.
"Livingstan" 1:0 "Rangers": Menga kills Gerard's goal.
The Rangers suffered another parachute when Dolly Mangy's goal convinced Stephen Gerard that he would not get a 1:0 parachute at Levingstan Stadium.
Aibrax wants to record his first victory on the way to a 4-1 triumph in February in St. John's, but the team of Gary Holtman is already carrying Gerard's second parachute as a manager with 18 games to leave on his left side of the ball.
I was hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers team, inspired by the goal, didn't look like they were suffering from a parachute.
At the same time as the Rangers dropped to sixth place, Levingstan rose to third place, while the Hibernians are left behind with a difference in the balls.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems after the forward Kalum Spence is to be treated for a head injury after he has had an object thrown out of the stands.
Gerard made eight changes to the players, as a result of which Ira did not play in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Liv under the number 11, which allowed him to pick up a point from the Hearts last week, and was impressed by how well they dealt with their opponents at each step.
The Rangers had more possession of the ball, but Levigstan made more attempts to kill the ball.
They had to be killed in two minutes, when Mengee first pointed the ball through Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's gate, and then the midfielder took advantage of this chance.
James Keegan's successful penalty kick hit the cameraman Craig Halket, but his defensive partner Alan Lithow was able to make a strong hit from behind.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third of the games they hoped to kill more than they demonstrated a good game.
Alfredo Mar<0xC3><0xA1>las certainly should have been punished with a penalty of a quarter of an hour before the end when he and Stephen Lovelles met on the field, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not accept Colombia's complaint.
The Rangers managed to knock on the door only in the first half of the game, but former goalkeeper Aibrox Liam Kelly almost failed to give the goal to Lasan Kulibali and the effective attack of Ova Ehiaria.
Although the first goal in the 34th minute of Libya may have been against a further active game, no one denies that they have to show off a good game as a guest.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to break through the Jacobs gate.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher gave the post to Scott Robinson, who blocked Meng to get the chance to kill in the gate.
Gerard replaced Culibaly in the break for Ryan Kent, and this proved to be an effective hit when he ran into Marla's assailant, but the impressive Kelly ran away and blocked the blow.
But “Livingstan” continued to please the visitors, playing in the game that they liked, and the Lithos and Halket continued to share the ball after a long confrontation.
Holt's side was only able to prevail at the last minute, but McGregor played well to resist Jacobs before Litt's departure to the reserve court.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton occurred a second time after being punished with a fine when he met with Jacobs, but Tomson managed to escape.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger calculator.
A page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and PADLIKI... the day of the future physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which resulted in the development of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger's counter became a part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 film Call of the Caranad, in which the seemingly infamous scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated.
Man: Who is he on earth?
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter, which is used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put on the earphones, you really have the ability to hear the sounds of atoms that give off radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: “Tell me, is that really necessary now?”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before the 63rd anniversary of his birth.
But the inventions that bear his name continue to be used.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system to “see” the cancer cells.
The new anti-cancer vaccine can help the immune system “see” the bad cells and destroy them.
The vaccine would teach the immune system to recognize the bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
The method involves obtaining the immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then the cells can "see" the proteins, which are common in many cancer cells, and then re-introduce auxiliary cells.
The trial vaccine demonstrates the successful results for patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who has been given a vaccine to help the immune system recognize cancerous cells has found that ovarian cancer has disappeared for 18 months.
The method involves obtaining immune cells in the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" HER2 proteins, common to many cancer cells, and then be reintroduced.
This was stated by Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Our results show that there is a very promising vaccine.
“HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of anti-cancer cells that fight cancer of the small intestine, ovaries, light and thick cats,” said Prof. Berazofsky.
A similar approach to the detection of immune cells in patients and "learning" them to achieve cancer cells worked well in the treatment of leukosis.
Kanye West began the discussion in support of Trump, holding the title of MAGA, after his appearance in the SNL.
That didn't turn out well.
In the studio during the evening of Saturday night, Kanye West was despised after a speech in which he praised the United States. President Donald Trump said he would vote for a second term in 2020.
After performing his third song in the evening called "The City of Passage", when he was in the "Let's Make America Great Again" cap, he spoke out against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“How many times do I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’”
"Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began the show with the lead role of Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star boasted about Brett Cavano's performance before the Senate Judiciary Committee while considering Christine Blaise Ford's sexual assault case.
Despite the fact that the speech was not broadcast, West's words fell into the frame and were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
I don't know if he's trying to get away from West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had a hard time behind the scenes.
They were staring at me behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t come out of this mess.
They were pissed at me.
“And then they say I’m in the wrong place,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued: Do you want to see the ugly place? “Tell him he” will wear my cap of Spermman, which means that he can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try to love.
Due to his statements, the hearings were withdrawn at least twice, and the representatives of the SNS were confused by a message from Veraiti. “The whole studio was silent”.
West was adopted as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many by the performance of the song I Love It, dressed in a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the leader of TPUSA’s conservative party, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the most courageous minds I thank you for your support.”
But leading the talk show, Karen Hunter wrote that West is just who he is, and it's always wonderful.
“But I have decided not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his ‘art’, which I believe, embraces and distorts an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
“Just like us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "officially called Kenny West".
He was not the first artist to change his name, and went on to follow in the footsteps of Jeddah, also known as Puff Jeddah.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was named after Snoop Lion and, of course, the music legend who changed his name to a symbol, and then still he and the artist, formerly known as the Prince.
Attempted murder in the restoration of "Belfast"
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a second man was attacked in a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balikhamor, police said.
The defendants are expected to appear in Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the State Prosecutor's Office.
The star of the Game of Thrones, Kit Haringtan, captured the idealized brutality.
Kit Harington is known for his expanding sword and the role of John Dreams in the series "Game of Thrones" in the mid-century raw material of HBO
But the 31-year-old actor has received the stereotype of the hero Macho, which means that young boys often feel tougher to respect.
Speaking at the Culture Sunday Times, Keith said he thought “something happened” and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
The cat, who recently married her neighbor at the Game of Thrones, also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, has admitted that she feels empowered to solve this problem.
“I personally feel like a strong guy – when we were wrong with courage,” he said.
“Why do we teach men when they grow up, from the point of view of the attitude we see now?”
The cat believes that the television must be responsible for the appearance of brutality due to the very male characters.
He continued: “What lies at the beginning, and why is it taught?
Why study on television and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they have to be so confident to be the right person?
I think it’s really one of the biggest questions of our time – how are we going to change that?
It's obvious that something is going on with young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that the series would end the following summer, and he would leave the battlefield of the series and would not make docuels or sequels to the "Game of Thrones".
From November, Kit will begin to resurrect True Western Sam Shepard, who is a historical director with his brother, who is a slave.
Recently, the actor reported that he considers a meeting with his wife, Rose, the best opportunity to complete the "Game of Thrones".
“I met my wife in this series, so I got my future family, and my life here,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a character who falls in love with the character of Keith John Snow in this fantasy series, awarded the Emmy Award.
The couple announced in June 2018 at Leslie's headquarters in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China is reporting an increase in new cases by 14%
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, as it was in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection is common in some parts of China as a result of infection due to blood transfusions.
“However, the number of such people who have been infected with HIV infection through blood transfusions has been reduced to almost zero,” Chinese officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grows by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV infection through sex is the acute problem of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination in relation to LGBT people is still eating.
Because of conservative values in the country, about 70-90% of men who engage in sex with men, in the end, marry women.
Many diseases are spread from inadequacy of knowledge and sexual counter-conceptions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address this global problem.
Maxine Waters denies the malice of the elderly, the danger and the conspiracy theory of her colleagues in parliament
U.S. Congressman Maxine Watters on Saturday dismissed the accusation that her colleague had posted personal information about three U.S. senators-republicans on Wikipedia's pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that there are claims to the participants of the upper-wing and their sites.
“A lie, a lie, and a lot of ugly lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
Published information, as reported, includes home addresses and phone numbers in the United States. Sense. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Oryn Hatch, both from Utah.
The information, posted by an unknown man on the Capitol Hill during hearings by the Senate Commission on Sexual Assaults in relation to a member of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, appeared on the Internet on Thursday.
The incident took place a few days after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
“Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the source’s IP address was linked to the Waters office and provided information to a Waters team member,” Hill said.
“This unfounded claim is completely false and absolutely false,” Waters continued. . . . . .
“A member of my team, whose data, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these hoaxes and false accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unsubstantiated statement is a total lie and a total lie. . . .
The statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This refusal causes anger,” wrote Fleischer.
This shows that she doesn't have the courage to be a member of Congress.
If someone accuses them of what they didn't do, they shouldn't get caught.
They don't have to be silly.
They should not be questioned as to the motives of their accusations.
They need to be calm and friendly.
Fleischer compared Watters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh when they were accused of being over-excited during Thursday's hearings.
Amar Navara, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is contesting and taking part in the meetings in the midterm elections, also expressed in Twitter.
“This is a resounding statement if it is true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Watters said that her office had warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false statements.
“We guarantee that the culprits will be found,” she continued, “and they will take legal responsibility for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to any of my team’s employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Again takes a hit on the fictional spy Rowan Atkins.
Now it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXIT in any new British-inspired film, and this one seems to be in the comedy and action-franchise of Johnny Ingles, which began in 2003 with Johnny Ingles.
Is it possible for the satire to express itself well on how obviously dumb we look when we talk about the new export possibilities?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, incompetent Johnny English got a chance to laugh at things – his name was louder than all the comic creations he'd done for non-English gamers.
Of course, he's a secret agent, who, despite his glamorous pretensions, got a little like Cluzo with Mr. Bina's features and a little bit of a guy who brought the only note to the 2012 Alchemist's Choir of Fire at the Cherry Blossom.
Initially, his character was based on Atkins's wanderlust and international mysteries, which he once played in the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos on his way.
There are a few fun moments that haven't happened before.
I loved Johnny Inglish, who is approaching the helicopter, dressed in medieval heels, and the rotor blades are a bit bumpy on his helmet.
Atkins's gift to theatrical comedy is vividly demonstrated, but humor feels weak, and so it's strange especially when serious films such as "Agent 007: Mission Irresponsible" certainly offer comedy as a staple.
Humor feels like it's not just for adults, but also for children, and even insanely unfortunate cases of Johnny Inglish's not as inventive as Atkins' silent films in Bina's character.
The UK's long-standing concerns are a major problem for the UK.
Cyber-hacker has infiltrated the super-secret community of British spies in the UK, opening up the names of all British agents on the spot, to the disappointment of the prime agent – this is, unfortunately, a small role of Kevin Eld.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a proud and mixed actor who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible with this quasi-Terrecy-May, but not in the end.
Her intelligence advisors report that, since every true spy will be revealed, she will have to engage in some of those who are already in retirement.
And this means that for Johnny Inglish himself, everything gets complicated: now he works as a sixth teacher at a number of high school institutions and teaches how to be an unbiased operator: some good examples here, as the Inglish mukii propan.
English returned to Whitehall for an extra briefing and teamed up with his former longtime friend Bo, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Currently, because my marriage is tied to the commander of the submarine, the role of which Vicki Pepperdzin played is a bit of a waste.
So Batman and Robin get the awfully wrong things in the Queen's secret agency, where they work again, meeting with a beautiful woman, Volga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister receives a dangerous order from a charismatic technical billionaire, who states that he can solve the problems with the UK's hackers: with the notorious Jason Volt, played by Jake Laxman.
Inglisch and Bowe begin their action with the immediate things: disguise themselves under the officer, set fire to the French restaurant; create a pogrom, fight the smugglers on the board of the luxury yacht Volta; inglisch makes a clean anarchy.
All the moments are drawn for the last event, but equally pleasant and noisy, in which there are quite a lot of children on the TV.
It's pretty good material.
And as with other films about Johnny English, I couldn't think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkins a role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Labour Party has refused to develop a plan to pay the British for a four-day work week with a paycheck of five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a radical plan when the British work only four days a week, but they pay for five.
As it is reported, the party wants the leaders of the enterprises to pass on the results of the work carried out as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence, giving them an additional day off.
It was clear that the employees of the future will get pleasure from the three-day outings, but they will still get the same earnings.
The source notes that the idea corresponds to the party's economic program and plans to direct the country to support the workers.
The withdrawal of trade unions approved the transition to a four-day week as a good way to take advantage of the change in the economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “A planned review of the actions will be announced by the end of the year.
This will not happen now, but a four-day work week is an idea that corresponds to the view in the party and the overall business strategy of regulating the economy for the benefit of the workers.
The Labour Party is not the first to adopt such an idea, the Green Party promises to spend a four-day working week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the efforts of the Labour Party as a whole are not supported.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is a non-party policy goal, and it is not considered by the party.
Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to express his view of the socialist revolution in the economy. . . .
Mr. McDonnell said he had decided to return power from the “dirty directors” and “managers” to the communal enterprises.
The Chancellor's plans also foresee that the current shareholder of water resources may not get back the entire stock package, because the Labour government can make a "challenge" on the basis of the alleged violations.
He also confirmed that it is planned to put employees on the boards of companies and create joint equity funds to transfer 10 percent of the company's own funds to employees, which will include annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 sterling.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" that FBI investigators working with Kavanaugh needed to change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on his discharge to the Supreme Court at least a week. The question arises as to whether the findings of the Bureau of the Republic of Kazakhstan can be reached.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Paley, a 60-minute correspondent, asked Republicans Johnny Kennedy and Lindsay Graham about the "Sens": "Can the FBI reveal anything that could lead to change?"
Kennedy was more open-minded than his fellow South Koreans.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said, going to the court hearing: I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened and asked the reason for the accusation, asking, “Did you do this?”
He was determined and determined.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to be final.
“I think Brett Cavano has decided that this is going to be a scandalous accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett definitely denies it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
“And everyone she calls couldn’t believe it.
She is only 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the International Festival of Citizens and what has been done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York is the International Festival: an annual musical event, which has a very impressive composition of performers and performers and has a mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Citizenship Festival will take place on the big lawn of the Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the concert of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, and will be able to fly
The International Festival of Citizenship, which emerged in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Project against the Horn of the International Propaganda Group, which is hoping to end poverty due to the increase in the number of people who are facing the crisis.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (if you do not want to pay a VIP ticket) the visitor had to perform a number of tasks or "realty of the action", be a waiter, write to the leader of the country by e-mail, call and call
But how successful has the Civil Festival been for 12 years and has it been able to achieve its goal?
Is it an idea to reward people with free concerts in a real way to convince people of the need for active actions, or is it just another case of so-called “clickwiseness” – people feel that they are doing well on the Internet
Since 2011, the festival’s organizers have announced that they have registered more than 19 million “actions” from their supporters, who are trying to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have helped push influential leaders to carry out commitments to an account of more than $37 billion, which could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group made 390 comments on commitments and made at least $10 billion in claims that have already been allocated or collected.
According to the group's estimates, the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key responsibilities include the provision of food, partnership with investors and performers based in the UK, "helping children to develop in full", the promise of a guarantee of safety, the promise of a guarantee of safety in Russia.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can address the social injustices of the past,” Ambassador Tracy Ulman said in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5000 actions were carried out, which were called in the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the project "food aid", which reaches 5 million people.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “What makes you think we can end poverty?”
The Global Festival said: "It will be a long and difficult way, sometimes we will suffer from paralysis and injustice.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we will be stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wickend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Janel Monae are among a number of characters performing at this year's New York event, which will be led by Deborah Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy to “block” Russia’s oil and gas exports
“Washington can, if necessary, appeal to the Navy to prevent the release of Russian energy on the EU and Middle East markets,” U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zink said in a statement.
Zink claimed that Russia's actions in Syria, particularly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, are the basis for the study of new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to acquire energy just as much as they do in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the author, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the ability, with the help of the Navy, to ensure the openness of the seabed, and, if necessary, to organize the blockade so that their energy is not likely to enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-commercial group that positions itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less re-evaluating and replacing fuel,” he said, calling Russia a “side country” with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements came at a time when the Trump administration wants to significantly increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which for European consumers is a much cheaper option.
For this, the Trump administration’s employees, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the “wrong” gas pipeline project “North Stream 2”, which, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a “pole.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the gas pipeline "North Stream 2" at the cost of 11 billion dollars, which is created to double the power of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's tough stance on this project is starting in the economy and is an example of uncontested competition.
“I believe that we have the only view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with the U.S. Energy Minister in Russia.
The Americans were struck in response by Germany, which once again reaffirmed its support for the project.
The German Federation of German Industrialists (BDI) has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow, the main German organization representing industry.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dither Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industrialists (BDI) after a recent meeting between Chancellor Ulysses and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
"Elizabeth Warren is going to take her part in the 2020 presidential election very seriously," a Massachusetts senator said in a statement.
Massachusetts State Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would seriously consider her participation in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a speech in Hallioki City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of her involvement.
“It’s time for women to head to Washington and direct our invalid government, and I’m also talking about women in the highest places,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will take the possibility of running for president very seriously.”
During a speech in the mayor’s office, Warren lashed out at President Donald Trump, saying that he “leads the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am extremely concerned about what Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his candidacy in Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course, before the vote it is necessary for the FBI to conduct an investigation.”
However, the results of the poll, published on Thursday, showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe that she should run for president in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the political research center of the University of Safalka/Bostan Gloub, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “possible” voters said that the Senate should not vote.
Thirty-two percent of the respondents supported the decision.
The poll showed greater support from former governor David Patrick, where 38 per cent were against and 48 per cent against.
Other well-known names among the Democrats that have been discussed in connection with the potential vote in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he will officially take a decision by January.
During a visit in support of Donald Trump, Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic syndrome of Trac Palin
The 26-year-old Trac Palin spent a year in Iraq after being called into service in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence, according to the police.
“What my son is going through after his return, I can compare with the results of post-traumatic syndrome and the injuries our soldiers are returning to other families,” she said, gathering at the rally in support of Donald Trump.
Palin called this arrest a “painful question” and said that her son, along with other veterans of the war, “returns a little bit to others, overwhelmed, returning with the question of whether there is that respect for which the soldiers, the pilots, the other armies fought.”
He was arrested on Monday in Usilla, Alaska, and he was charged with domestic violence against women, obstructed by attempts to report domestic violence, the use of weapons in a drunken state, according to a press release from the BBC.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the deliberation of a new policy on the provision of port
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the debate on a new U.S. policy, which denies in the port a victim of extortion by gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts of Colombia filed an analytical record on Friday in Washington, D.C., to support the dispute over the port's delivery policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was opened in August by the U.S. Civil Rights Union against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his friends with a hard gang" raped her, but the U.S. authorities on July 20 refused at the port.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which the largest number of requests for asylum in the U.S., as countries that have serious problems with gangs and domestic violence, are coming.
The new U.S. port policy changed the 2014 decision of the Appellate Commission on Immigration, which allowed immigrants without documents, who are victims of domestic violence, to turn to the port.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia, Carl Reisin, said on Friday that the new policy “honors decades of legislative experience of states, countries and the world.”
“Federal legislation requires that applications to the port be based on specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a change violates this principle,” according to the analytic natata.
The lawyers also said in a statement that a policy that denies immigrants worsens the U.S. economy, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and “create the jobs they need.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to provide a haven for the victims of domestic violence and violence on the part of gangs.
“The port is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or political views,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
The port has never meant solving problems, not even all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue work in Pal. During an attempt to find those who survived, the number of dead doubled
Those who have survived are in a very difficult situation.
“Everything is very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother of Risha Kusuma, calming her young son with temperatures in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Pal.
"Every minute, the car "quickly" brings the bodies.
There is very little clean water.”
Residents began to return to their ruined homes, picking up the wet stuff, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-point earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Two Harris, who broke his spine and shoulder, are located outside Paul's Army Hospital, where patients are being treated on the street due to the strong stabbings that are repeated.
He had tears in his eyes when he remembered the feeling of a strong slump in the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to fight.
I was stuck under the rubble of the wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for marriage.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then the silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Threats” Using “Propaganda Advertising”
A week after the official Chinese newspaper printed a four-page ad in the U.S. daily, praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused U.S. officials of abusing Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday mentioned China Daily’s paid addition to the Des Moines Register – the state’s best-selling newspaper – after he accused China of trying to interfere in the U.S. election.
Trump's accusation that China was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what the U.S. officials in a speech with Reuters called a new phase in Washington's pressure on China.
Although the placement of advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice for the promotion of trade, now Beijing and Washington have unleashed a trade war, resulting in the mutual imposition of tariffs on imports.
Repressive tariffs, U.S. and Chinese experts have said, have been introduced to harm exporters such as contractors from the state of Iowa, who support Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, China's main exporter of agricultural goods, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, wrote Branstad in an author’s article in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, “is now doubling its efforts by printing propaganda advertisements in our free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the good American tradition of freedom of speech and the free press, by printing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Brensted wrote.
"And if you look at the newspaper kiosks in Beijing, then there you will find not so many voices against and you will not see the real reflection of other opinions that the Chinese may have about the dangerous trajectory in the economy, the greed of the frog, taking into account the fact that the frog
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers has refused to accept the proposal" to print his article, although he did not name it.
Women's suffrage campaigners are pushing back women's suffrage in the run-up to the midterm elections from Fiasco Cavano, analysts warn
While many well-known Republicans are defending a candidate for the post of Supreme Court Justice Brett Cavano in the face of several allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will get hit in response, especially from women, at times.
The emotions around this have been very strong, and most Republicans are already showing that they are ready to vote.
“These things can no longer be returned,” said Grant Rychar, a professor of political science at the Maxwell Syracuse University School of the publication “The Hill” for the article, which was printed on Saturday.
Richard said he wasn't sure that Senator Jeff Flack's (Arizona) statements about the FBI's investigation would be enough to calm down angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and in November,” said Karen Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national press secretary of the progressive group MoveOn, a newspaper from Washington.
On Friday morning, the protesters chanted "Let's go fast!" during a demonstration in the Senate Hall, when the Republicans who control the legal committee decided to postpone the candidacy of Kavanaugh, despite Dr. Christina's statement.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the democrats will be extremely great,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say they’re already tall, and that’s true.
But they can be even higher, especially among women-electors in suburbs and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who do not like the president, but often do not vote.”
Even before Ford's open statement, in which it detailed its allegations of a candidate in the Supreme Court in sexual violence, analysts believe that if Republicans insist on endorsements, there may be a serious blow to the place.
“For the Republican Party, this has become a bit of a mess,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not about the vote of the committee or the final vote, it’s about whether or not Kavanaugh will be in office. It’s about how the Republicans handled it and how they dealt with it,” noted U.S. news channel U.S. Ambassador Gai Prirupoli.
However, it looks like the Americans have split up on the question of whether Ford or Kavanaugh is right, which is a little more than the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are likely or not very sure to trust Ford's statement, and 35 percent said that they are likely or not very sure to trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that, according to them, Kavanaugh may or may not have lied in his statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following a raid by the FBI's Flake, the FBI investigates allegations by Ford and at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made a statement under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, when drunk, was pursuing her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for the Supreme Court demonstrated her genetics at a party when they were studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global network plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global network, is launching a startup that will become a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company built on the open platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows the user to choose the location of the data storage and who has permission to access this information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that by creating Inrupt, he meant “controlling the world.”
“You have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create "their own data storage on the Internet" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, case lists, calendars, fanatical and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on the same browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of personal data storage on the Internet is that only the user determines who has access to what type of information.
The company calls this “a personal strengthening of the potential with the help of data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the opportunity to bring together the resources, process, and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers who are working on a contract-based project and fund-raisers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized programs, using the tools available on the Inrupt website. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Brunners-Lee said he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make complete changes when all of their business models are reviewed immediately.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
In a Saturday publication on the issue Medium Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission “is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem for the protection of the integrity and quality of the new network created on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the Consortium of the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been very influential in promoting the neutrality of the network.
Even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the new era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: The Ascension of a Priest Awarded by the Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only priest of the Church of England, awarded by the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a participant in the battles, was commemorated in his city 100 years later.
Vice-Admiral Bernard Van was rewarded on 29 September 1918 for his involvement in the attack under Belengles and Leacourt.
However, four days later, he died from a sniper's bullet and never found out that he had received the highest British military award.
On Saturday in the town of Rashden, Narthemptanshire County, two of his grandchildren at the parade opened a memorial stone.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "very symbolic" that the stone opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded.
According to the London Gazette, September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Van led his battalion through the Canal de San Quentin “once thick an eyelash and under the strong red and bullet-like fire of a labourer.”
Then he ran to the line of fire and "with great courage" led the soldier forward, seizing the gun on his own and firing three divisions.
Lieutenant Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little more than a month later the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do, and something worthy of respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also raised a wreath after the parade, which was chaired by the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Van said that "for his great honor to take part in the parade" and added that "the marriage of a true hero was demonstrated by the support shown by many."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, they instead got Pep's lead
Just imagine, you've been up all night to watch the packed transmission from Bellator 206, and then you're denied in the main event preview.
The San Jose program had 13 battles, including six on the main map, and they aired live throughout the night on the British Channel 5.
And on the sixth morning, when Gerard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the fight, watching in the UK, they were simply relieved when the program changed to Pep's lead.
Some were disappointed after spending a sleepless night, deliberately waiting for this fight. . . .
One of the tweets on Twitter called the switch to a children’s cartoon as a “somewhat stupid joke.”
In response to a question about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said: “According to the state decree at 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate and had to be switched to a children’s program.”
"Yes, "Pepa's Pig."
Bellator chairman Scott Cocker said that in the future they will be working on the program to take into account British viewers.
“I think we’re going to discuss the possibility of a repeat, I think we can solve this issue,” Cocker said.
"But now it's the sixth morning of Sunday, and we can't solve it until Sunday in our time, and it's Monday in their time.
But we're doing everything possible.
Believe me, when the programs changed, we received a lot of messages and not all of them were pleasant.
We tried to solve the problem by considering that this is a technical error.
But it was a state-of-the-art decision.
I can assure you that this won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of shots from six to five, as we usually do, this time we wanted to cheer the fans, but we didn't try.
This is the final situation.”
"Inhuman Island Giants": Tom Daley found himself "insignificant" because of sexuality
Tom Daley, the Olympic water jumper, said he had grown up with feelings of insignificance for others because of his sexuality – but that gave him motivation on the road to success.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t understand that “not everyone is like me” until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's "Desks of the Inhuman Island" program in lead Laurent Laverne, he said he supports gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that when he had a child, he began to think less about winning the Olympics.
The traditional leader of this rather old Kirsty Young program, took a break for a few months due to the disease.
In the role of a man who turned out to be on an inhuman island, on Laverne's first program, Daley said that as a child he felt "lesser" than everyone else, because "the bourgeoisie did not accept those who liked both boys and girls."
He said: “I still think that the feeling that you are not as all and insignificant was what gave me the strength and inspiration to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "someone", he said, so that he did not disappoint those who learned about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medallist of the Olympiad became a significant activist of the LGBT movement and at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on the country not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said that he expressed his opinion because he was lucky to live openly, without persecution and wanted to give "hope" to others.
A three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – an American screenwriter, director and producer, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “it was unexpected to me.”
Daley married the owner of the Oscar, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but, according to him, the age difference doesn't matter.
“If you’re going through this at such a young age” – at the first Olympics he was 14 years old, and even after three years his father died of cancer – he said that it was difficult to find a man who would experience such an ascent and descent.
In June, they became parents, their son was named Robert Ray Black-Daly, and Daley said his “expectations” had changed completely.
“If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I need to win a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are things in the world that are more important than the Olympic gold medal.
“Robi is my gold Olympic medal.”
His son is also named after his father, Robert. His father died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he would die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to sit in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not immortal,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew that it was what I’ve dreamed of my whole life about – jumping into the water in front of my scorers at the Olympics, it’s the best feeling,” he said.
This also affected the choice of the song – Proud by Heather Small – which found in it a feedback in preparation for the Olympics and from which the ants are still running.

Michaelson, who is not in shape, remains on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Michaelson set a record on Sunday, playing his 47 games in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to get back in shape so that the event doesn't turn out to be an unfortunate one.
Michaelsana, who will play in this competition, which is held once every two years, a record 12 times, team captain Jim Furyck has sat on the bench of spares for Saturday's matches.
Instead of being at the center of events, and he was there often behind the United States team, a five-time cup winner shared his days between the work of a cheerleader and training, hoping to return to form.
Even at the peak of his career he was not the best player, and now the 48-year-old golfer is not the perfect choice for the rough terrain of Le Golf National, where rough blows are punished.
And if the field itself isn't dark enough, in the ninth game on Sunday, Michaelson will fight against the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinara, who, along with Tom Flitwood, won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are behind on the four points at the beginning of 12 singles matches, start with success, the match of Michaelson can be extremely important.
F<0xC3><0xBC>r<0xC3><0xBC>rk expressed confidence in this player, but could not say anything more.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he’d be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He’s very confident in himself.
He was accepted into the Hall of Fame and gave a lot of teams in the past and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan on two games.
I was planning more, but that's how we thought we would play.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else.”
Michaelson will break Nick Fall's record for the number of games in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
This may be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which has never been the same as the achievements in individual games.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halves, though Furyk said his presence has benefited the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, with a sense of humor, he likes to joke about people and he’s just a very good person to have on the team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to share his jokes, also this week, and it was good to see it.
He gives the team a lot more than just a game.”
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a big break could soon disappear.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant departure from the individual games of the last day at the Ryder Cup may easily disappear.
The Dutch player made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderam, where the European team under the leadership of Seva Ballesteras had a five-point lead over the Americans, but finished with a minimum lead of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You constantly remind yourself that in Valderam we had a great advantage and won the Golf, but with difficulty, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost,” said Bjorn after reviewing how the team of Class of 2018 won the 5–3 win, the 5–3 win and the 5–3 win.
“The story shows me and everyone else in the team that it’s not over yet.
We'll have to play a hundred tomorrow.
Go out on the field and do it right.
As long as it's not on the list, nothing's over.
We have a goal and that’s an attempt to win this trophy, that’s what we’re going to focus on.
I keep saying that, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that the best players in the world are on the opposite side.”
Satisfied with how his players played on the hard field for golf, Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn added: "I will never overestimate myself in this.
Tomorrow is going to be a different game.
Tomorrow's game is going to be different, and that's different.
It's just great if you're on the field with a partner and everything goes well, but if you're playing alone, then here's your true talents of a golfer.
Here's what you need to tell the players that they have to show the best tomorrow.
Now we have to leave the partner, they have to go and also show the best as an individual player.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, his rival Jim Furyck hopes for a better individual game of his own sportsmen than the one they demonstrated in the partnership, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who are in the
Furyk himself was on both sides of these matches the last day, playing in the winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had a "miracle in the Medina."
“I remember every word of it,” he said, responding to a question about how Ben Crancho, the 1999 captain set his players up for the final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we always want to have a quick start that you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
As the speed increases, the greatest pressure is exerted on those who play matches in the middle.
We made the right schedule and put the players as we liked. You know, tomorrow we will try to get some magic.”
Thomas is tasked with starting the game and is playing against Rory McLean in the main game, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flintwood and John Paulter will play against the top golfers.
“I put my players in that order because I think I’m going to close everything down like that,” Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn said of his choice for individual matches.
The launch of a new German warship has been postponed again.
The new frigate of the German Navy was due to enter service in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will appear no earlier than next year due to faulty systems and a constantly increasing cost.
The downing of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of an entirely new class of Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoting a military representative.
The ship was supposed to go into service in 2014, but the problems that arose after the construction of the ship are hampering this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warships, ordered as early as 2007, are to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will be armed with powerful weapons, various anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some "Stales" technologies, for example, reduced visibility for radars, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important features – longer periods between teh services – more new frigates may not enter their parties for up to two years.
However, constant delays mean that modern warships — which can allow Germany to demonstrate its power outside the country — are aging until they finally get into operation, Die Zeit notes.
The unlucky F125 frigate hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned its shipyard Blohm & Voss to Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media wrote about many "defects in software and equipment" that make the ship useless in a combat mission.
The shortages of software were especially important, because the Baden-Wuertemberg-class ships have only 120 sailors – half of the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship has a very high weight, which reduces its performance and limits the possibility of further upgrades.
The Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice the weight of similar class ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the price of the entire project – including the training of the crew – is also becoming a problem.
The price reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) – although initially it was 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that are accumulated with the new frigates are made especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, said the Navy "has fewer and fewer ships capable of military missions."
He said that the problem is increasing over time, because the old ships are listed, and there are no replacement ships.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were able to join the Navy.
The National Association for the Protection of Monuments has listened to the secret life of the janitors
A new study, conducted in the Highlands of Scotland, is aimed at discovering how the landscape is said to be used in the hunt for food.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behaviors of unique milk-eating mammals and to help in future actions to preserve these animals.
The research of scientists of the National Society for the Protection of Monuments of Scotland is carried out in small sayings and also in the turbulent long sayings of Dabanton in the gardens of Inver Gardens in Western Ross.
Special devices for recording will be placed in the main places of this location, in order to monitor the actions of the speakers during the season.
The company's employees and volunteers will conduct mobile research with the use of hand-held detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all the records determines the frequency of calls of the speakers, as well as those who are said to do what they do.
The map of residence and the report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Dwyer, the National Society for Conservation of Nature's advisor, hopes that the results will show which areas are most important for the geese and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the advantages of creating such habitats as meadows, and how to support forests for the habitat of kennels and other related animals.
The number of cases in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works, which affect the place of residence and destroy them.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as well as sticky nozzles for flies and some chemicals for building materials. They are also threatened by domestic cats.
They're not blind at all.
However, due to their nocturnal life, the ears said more sensitive than the eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use a complex ejection technique to detect bugs and obstacles on the way to the flight.
The National Society, which is responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about the khans.
It employs ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, check out the places of residence, and, at times, rescue events.
The organization even created the first and only Scottish kangaroo reserve in the Triumph in Damfris and Galava, where eight out of ten species of kangaroo live.
The head of the estate, David Thompson, says it's the perfect area for janitors.
"Here, at Triv, we just have a great place to say," he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a very good place to live.
But we don’t know much about the sayings yet, so our work here and in other gems will help to better understand what they need for a better life.”
He underscores the importance of checking for the presence of swans before carrying out a property repair, as one seat can be unintentionally destroyed, killing up to 400 males and young swans, which will lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
They are said to be under cover and are forbidden to kill, frighten, disturb or destroy their seats.
Elizabeth Faral, an employee of the Organisation for the Protection of Narcotic Drugs in Scotland, is calling on the public to help in this matter.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our fairy tales, and many of the species we don’t even know how their populations live.”
Randall denies the charges of rape, and his lawyers are going to go to court for a German magazine
Christiana Ranaldo called his accusations of rape “fake news,” saying that people want to “advertise themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are about to appear in court for the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published these accusations.
The forward of the Portugal and Juventus assembly was accused of raping American Catherine Majorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Then, as if he had paid her $375,000 for silence, he wrote on Friday Der Spiegel.
In the Instagram Live video, 33-year-old Ranaldu turned to 142 million of his subscribers a few hours after the charges were released, calling this message “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today’s messages are fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball owner told the camera. . . .
“They want to advertise on my behalf.
That's okay.
They want to be known by mentioning my name, but that's part of my job.
I’m a happy and good person,” he added with a smile.
Randall's lawyers are preparing a case against Der Spiegel magazine on charges that they called "an inadmissible report of suspicions in a private case," the Reuters news agency reported.
Christian Hearts, a lawyer, said the player would be required to pay compensation for “marital damages in the amount that corresponds to the severity of a violation of rights, and in recent years this is perhaps the most serious violation of personal rights.”
It was as if the incident had taken place in June 2009 in the luxury room of the Palms Hotel and Casinos in Las Vegas.
"Meeting at a nightclub between Ronald and Major as if they were returning to the football player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, as written in documents from the Clark County District Court in the state of Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after that, Ranalda hugged and said that at 99 percent, he is a "good guy" who suffers from "one percent".
The documents claim that Randall admitted that they had sex, but according to the parties.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to a bail settlement, because "the revenge was very much feared" and she was worried that she would "publicly bring it down".
A 34-year-old woman says she now wants to resume the charge because she feels a moral trauma in the case.
At a time when it seemed as if this case had taken place, Ronaldo was going to move to Madrid’s Real Madrid with Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italy’s Juventus, closing the deal at 100 million euros.
BREXIT: UK ‘always regrets’ the loss of car builders <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Britain will “always regret” losing its status as the world’s automotive leader after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clarke said in a statement.
He added that he was “disturbed” by Toyota UK’s statement to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, the company will temporarily cut production at the plant in Bernaston, near Derby, in half.
“We need an agreement,” said Mr. Clark.
Japan's carmaker said the impact of a delay on the border as a result of Brexit without a deal could lead to job cuts.
The factory in Bernaston – where Toyota Auris and Avensis are made – last year released almost 150,000 cars, of which 90% were exported to other EU countries.
“In my opinion, when Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s director at Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have raised the question of how cross-border trade will be carried out when Britain leaves the EU without a deal. Among them are Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, announces that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is related to the fact that car builders are talking about the risk of supply chains as a result of Brexit without a deal.
Toyota's production line operates on the basis of "exactly on time", when spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for cars that are made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there may be obstacles at the border that will lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
For Toyota, it will not be possible to hold a factory in Derby for more than a day stock, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr Clarke said May’s “Chuckers Plan” on future relations with the EU “was designed precisely to avoid these border checks.”
“We need an agreement. We want to get the best agreement that will not only allow today’s success, but also allow us to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“The information we receive not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicates that we need to be able to continue the work of successful supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to report how long the production will not work, but warned in the future that the added cost will reduce the factory's competitiveness and lead to a reduction in jobs.
Peter Tzuvalaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the trade union, said that the members of the trade union are very concerned: "In my opinion, if the jobs are cut, they will not be renewed.
The press secretary of the government said: “We have proposed an accurate plan of our future relationship with the EU, which deserves confidence.”
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again.
A very important meeting of Donald Trump with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “scheduled for a week” while the fight around the candidate in the Supreme Court of the United States, White House spokesman Brett Cavano said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who studies interference in elections by Russia, the connections between Trump's aides and Russia, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
To fire Trump's assistant attorney general or not, and thus put Mueller's independence at risk, oil has been pouring into the fire of Washington's planes for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record conversations with Trump, and the possibility of removing the president from office with the help of 25 amendments.
Rosenstein rejected this.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid rumors that he was going to fall behind.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting would take place on Thursday with Trump, who was at the UN headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he "wouldn't" dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid hearings at the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women, who accused him of being a prostitute, accused him of sexual harassment.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into a statement against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News Sunday program.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not yet set, maybe this week, maybe next. I think that, rather, a week later, taking into account all the other things that matter.
But everything will happen, and I always give the press the latest information.”
Some journalists are willing to dispute her assertion: Sanders has not conducted press briefings at the White House since September 10.
When Chris Wallace was on the show, he asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of the briefings was due to no disrespect to teleporters who “work in public,” though she added: “I’ll agree with the fact that they work in public.”
Then she said that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president has more meetings with answers to questions of the press than any president that was before him,” she said, adding without concrete facts: “We’ve studied these numbers.”
The briefings are taking place, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to immediately ask questions to the president of the United States, it's much better than doing it through me.
We try to do it often, you’ve seen how we’ve done it in the last few weeks. Such meetings, at which you can ask the question directly to the president, will replace the briefings.”
Trump regularly responds to questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in meetings on the street, or in press conferences with high-profile foreign guests.
The President's own press conference is rarely held.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why, when free and sometimes extravagant, he appeared in front of reporters.
The Minister of Health has written to an employee from EU countries in Scotland's health care system in front of Brexit.
The Minister of Health has written to an EU worker working in the Scottish health system to express his gratitude on behalf of the country and wish them to remain even after Brexit.
Jean Freeman sent a letter less than half a year before Britain's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of applications for residence from EU citizens who work in the country's public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the exit of our country continued. They lead to the expected decisions this autumn.
But the British government has also prepared for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very difficult time for all of you.
That's why I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
My colleagues from all EU countries, and not only, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service, also benefit the patient and our community.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us.”
Christine Abercrombie has undergone a temporary operation after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers team linebacker Christine Abercrombie has moved on to a temporary operation after receiving a head injury in a Sunday game that his team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores team, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injured player had been given a break shortly before the break.
“He went to the sideline and suddenly fell,” said Ryd.
The trainers and doctors gave Abercombe the oxygen still on the field before placing it on the violence and transferring it to establish a diagnosis.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris from WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been resuscitated at the Van derby Medical Center.
Harris added that there was "no more skill about what the injury was", and Tennessee State is trying to identify when the player got the injury.
Abercrombie, a second-class athlete, spends the first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full interceptions, giving only 18 intercepts per season.
Foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher tax rate.
According to the new plans of the Conservatives, foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher tax, and additional money will go to the help of the homeless.
This act neutralizes the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters.
The increase in the state tax is due to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance plans to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Today, Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher state tax, and that additional money will go to the help of the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters, as well as even affordable housing. It is aimed at people with high incomes.
The increase in the state tax is aimed at individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money received will go to the government's homeless housing grant program.
The increase in the current state tax, including the higher levels adopted two years ago, on the purchase of second homes and housing for rent, can amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents of the UK, which leads to an increase in prices and new buyers find it difficult to buy their first home.
Many of the country’s rich regions – especially the capital – have become “city-views” because a large number of buyers because of the border most of the time do not live in the UK.
The new policy emerged literally a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call to reduce the state tax on young buyers in order to facilitate the purchase of the first home.
He accused the large construction firms of keeping high prices on the property by taking over the land and not using it, and called on Mrs. May to cancel the quotas for affordable housing in order to make the “bad situation in the world” worse.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a major series of housing reforms, including the control of rents and the cessation of “irresponsible” eviction.
He also wants to give more power to the local council in the field of housing construction.
Ms May said: “Last year I said that I will dedicate my work to the post of Prime Minister to the restoration of the British dream – life for every new generation must be made better.
This means that we are improving the quality of our home market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their own lives.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live in the UK and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as the working people of the UK.
For too many people, the dream of having their own home is becoming more and more inaccessible, and the problem of the homeless remains very real.”
Jack Ross: “My main ambition is to run the Scottish National Assembly”
“Sanderland coach Jack Ross has said his main ambition is to one day become a coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old is tasked with restoring the club from the northeast, which is now in third place in the First League, at three points from the first.
He moved to this job in the summer, after returning to the St. Mary's in the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
But it didn’t work out,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“I grew up sick of Scotland at the Hampden Stadium with my father, and something always forced me to come back.
However, such an opportunity will emerge if I become a successful club coach.”
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach were Dick Advocate, David Moses, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neal, Roy Kin, Gus Poye and Paula Di Kania.
Former coach of Aloa Athletic says he did not feel fear of such well-known names at such a large club, having previously rejected proposals from Burnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The answer to the question, ‘Will I be able to bring this club back to the Premier League?’
According to the structure and material base of the club its place is probably in Prime Minister Liza," he said.
“It’s not just to get him back there, but I’ll consider my work a success only if I can get the club back there.”
Ross only worked as a coach for three years, before that he was assistant coach at Dumbarton and worked for 15 months at the Harts coaching staff.
He then helped Aloa return from the third league and converted Saint-Mir<0xC3><0xA8>ne from a loser, who almost made it to the Championship in the winner of the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
Recalling the work in “Aloa,” he said that “It was a really important choice.”
“I really believed that coaching was what I needed, even more than a game.
It sounds amazing, because I've worked well, earned well, and achieved some heights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I'm still going through this when it comes to stress and pressure, but coaching is what I need.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it, and for me it’s the best time of my adult life.”

According to research, the ideal time to drink a pint of beer – 17:30 on Saturday
In the hot summer, the profits of British groceries, which are struggling to survive, increased, but brought pressure on restaurant networks.
According to the statistics of the customs and bar group, sales increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but in restaurants the sales volume decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the consulting business group CGA, which collected this statistics, stated: "The long solar weather and longer than expected, the participation of the English team in the finals of the World Cup, which means that in July, there were more than
The decline in sales in restaurants by 1.8 per cent in June, only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars, which mainly sell drinks, have so far shown the best result in contrast to the restaurants.
The pubs that sell more food are also hungry in the sun, although not as strong as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to drink.
In pubs and bars, the sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent, and the sales of food decreased by three percent.”
Paul Neumann, RSM analyst on rest and location issues, said: “These results are made by the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to the volume of sales in the food market.
It's no surprise that restaurants continue to struggle, as sales have fallen by 4.8 percent per year, and it's very unpleasant when the money is constantly growing.
A long and hot summer has come at the most miserable time for operators focused on food, and time will show whether the lower temperatures in August will bring such an expected relief.”
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the recently opened ones, accounted for 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the deceleration of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker's sales tracking tool in British pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active groups, which have a total turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is an important benchmark for this trend.
Every fifth child has a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents.
The study showed that one in five children – some who were only 11 – have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers.
Study of 20,000 high school students showed the growth of "fake Insta" pages
It's a story that scares people into posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a "basic" account that shows their parents
One in five children – some of whom are only 11 – create accounts on social media accounts, which they keep secret from their parents.
The study of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth of “fake Insta” accounts – which seem to lead to the site exchange of Instagram photos.
The news has sparked fears that there will be a release of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said that they keep “pure” “basic” account records to show to their parents, and also keep private account records.
One mother, who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website, found out that she had called on others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC), found that 40 percent of adolescents aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had secret accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It’s very worrying that so many teenagers want to create places on the Internet where neither parents nor teachers will find them.”
Eileen Doyle will be the “sportman’s voice” in the Scottish Council of Athletics
Eileen Doyle was elected to the Scottish Council of Light Athletics as an observer member of the council at the body's annual general meeting.
Doyle – the most titled lightweight athlete of Scotland and CEO Ian Beatty described this event as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to get a lot of benefits from her experience at a variety of levels, including international for the last time.
“Elyde has a lot of respect in Scotland, the UK and the global sports community, and we are confident that the lightweight athletics in Scotland will get a lot of benefit from her work in the world,” said Bice.
Doyle said: “I want to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope to help manage the sport in Scotland.”
An American who won gold at 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, and two other gold medals at other Olympics, and who now works as an expert at the BBC, cannot walk after suffering a stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it was only a matter of time before I knew what I was going to do.
It was a hard job, but I've completely recovered, learned to walk again, and now I'm doing an internship!
Thank you for the message of support!”
The advertising of a small pump, where the mother compares with the cows, shared opinions on the Internet
The company for the production of small pumps shared its opinion, issuing an ad that compares feeding women with the cows they breastfeed.
To mark the launch of what’s called “the world’s first small-scale pump,” consumer company Elvie has released an Iranian music ad based on the video to show the freedom it gives to the feeding mother.
The four real mothers dance in the chorus under the song, where there are the words: “Yes, I give myself, but I don’t have a feast” and “In case you haven’t noticed, it’s not a joke, it’s my breasts.”
And he sang, "Yes, yes, yes, I am feeding the children, yes, yes, yes, I am giving my wives."
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, caused a heated discussion on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments. The reaction to the video was ambiguous, many said it was a horror of small production.
“It is a very difficult decision to use the penalties for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to give milk, only their children are selected in a few days,” wrote one viewer.
Elvie's Little Pump Is Incredibly Hidden in a Breastplate for Feeders (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “Of course, it is traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use them to advertise a small pump for a mother who doesn’t have children?”
Someone added: “Such an inconceivable advertisement.”
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman wrote that she considered the song to be “fun”.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd love to have one of those if I had breast cancer.
The smell of milk makes me feel like I'm pregnant.
It's a little crazy, but I liked it.
It’s a great product,” she wrote.
Another comment: “A very entertaining advertisement aimed at the mother, who sucks the milk pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and hears themselves as ‘penalties’.
This ad does not endorse or condemn the small business.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they were all dancing with invisible small pumps hidden in the bras.
The concept of an advertising company is based on the fact that many women, who use small pumps, feel like they are being punished.
However, the Elvie Pump pump is completely noiseless, has no wires, no pipes, and is indisputably hidden in a bra for feeding women, gives women freedom of movement, allows to keep children and even leave the house during labor.
Anna Ballari, Partner and Creative Director of Mother, commented: “Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and directional launch.
By drawing a parallel between feeding women and small cows, we wanted to pay attention to the absorption of milk and its difficulty, while demonstrating in a fun and gentle way how the new small pump will bring an extraordinary swab.
This isn't the first time Elaine has been in the spotlight.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium in clothes by Martha Jakubowski, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children with no noise are being transported to a tent camp on the Texas border.
Although the number of border crossings per month has hardly changed, the number of detained migrant children has increased sharply, partly because of the harsh rhetoric and policies carried out by the Trump administration, which have hampered the placement of migrants.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors are immigrants-illegals, who are guarded from putting their own whereabouts in the country under threat, taking responsibility for the child.
The risks increased significantly in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential sponsor and other adult members of the homeowners would need to drop fingerprints and the data would be passed on to the immigration authority.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a high-ranking immigration and customs officer, spoke before Congress with a report on the arrests by the agency of dozens of people who have appealed with a request to bail out minors without consent.
It was later reported by the agency that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior convictions.
“About 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of their hosts are in the country illegally, and a significant part of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That’s why we continue to persecute such people,” said Mr. Olbens.
For the speedy processing of children, the perpetrators have introduced new rules, which require some to appear in court for a month from the date of detention, and, according to shelter workers, the earlier standard term was 60 days.
A large number of people to submit a statement about their own legal status to an immigration judge will have to use video communication, and not be present in a court of private.
Those who don't have the resources to help out quickly will be forced to leave.
According to the workers of shelters and reports from sources in the system, which have appeared in recent months, the longer the children remain in captivity, the higher the likelihood of depression or an increase in anxiety, which can lead to a delay.
Lawyers state that in larger institutions, such as Tarnilia, these problems are found to be much more severe, as the signs that the child is in good condition are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that moving children to a tented city without giving up time for emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma many have already faced.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of “occupational forces” from the United States, France and Turkey
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the war, which continues in the country for eight years.
Mualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are located on Syrian soil illegally, on the basis of the fight against terrorism, and "they will be considered accordingly."
“They should leave immediately and not put any conditions in place,” he said at the meeting of the Assembly.
In Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions of people have had to leave their homes, the war on terrorism is “nearly over.”
He said Damascus intends to “continue this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence,” he said.
In Syria, there are about 2,000 U.S. troops, who mainly serve as instructors and advisors to the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces, which are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France's ground contingent in this devastated war-torn country is more than 1,000 troops.
On the question of refugees, Mualim said that the conditions for return were favorable and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that contain refugees abroad.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to implement their return,” he said.
“They are politicizing a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given aid in the reconstruction until a political agreement on the end of the war is reached between Assad and the opposition.
U.N. diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major stronghold of the Idlib rebels has created an opportunity for political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale offensive by Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on a province where three million people live.
However, Mualim stressed that the agreement had "precise deadlines", and expressed hope that military actions would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaida-linked Nusra front, who "will be eliminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene in the near future the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, to develop a post-conflict constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem expressed the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the commission should be limited "by reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and refrained from interference.
Why is Trump going to the second term?
In this sense, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election, when, as many liberals hope, the impeachment and scandal will not finish his presidency.
And this, without a doubt, will be “The most dramatic finale of the presidency in all of history!”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have grown more than twice – to 1.05 million on CNN and almost three times – to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, on Fox News, an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the transmission of "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC channel garnered 3.5 million viewers on the screen and surpassed the cable channels.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because we don’t understand it,” said Neil Burr, director of ABC’s drama “The Replacement” about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
In Nellie Scowell, a prolific comedy writer and author of “A Few Funny Details and a Few Hard Truths About Entering the Galivud Boys’ Club,” there is another theory.
She mentions a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The president told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he’s amusing me,’” Ms. Scowell told me.
Chaos is also worth what you can enjoy.
Of course, unlike all the rest of the TV, the storylines that come out of Washington can become as decisive a future as the case of the "Road against Wade", depending on whether the immigrant family and the aliens will be able to do so.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, if you watch for the sixth hour how a group of experts is discussing the use of the word "information not for print" with Bob Woodward in the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's jacket for $15,000 with a layer of leather (clothing, clothes and linen on canvas)

“Part of what he’s doing makes you feel like you’re watching the reality show he’s showing every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and creator of “Pawn Stark.”
You can't afford to miss even one episode, otherwise you'll fall behind the trend.
When I spoke to Mr. Flies this week, behind the windows of his house on the northern shore of the Kauai stood a hot sunny day and 30 degrees of heat, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while he wrote on CNN.
It could not have happened, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Judiciary Committee, discussing the future of the Supreme Court, which hung on her hair.
“I remember the guys when we were doing these crazy shows, and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleis told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money flows are included in a strict pre-election race of direct elections in the House of Representatives.
It is not surprising that the 17th Electoral District of Pennsylvania has covered the money bay thanks to a change in the boundaries of the districts introduced by the Congress, which is why two candidates participate in the elections for one place.
The newly repainted suburban area of Pittsburgh is surrounded by a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in the election last spring.
Lambu is opposed by another acting MP, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely in line with the new 17th.
The maps were repainted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the votes of the old districts were unconstitutional in favor of the Republicans.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district caused a decline in the funding of the company by the financial groups of the main parties, the Committee of the Congress of the Democratic Company (CCDC) and the National Committee of the Republican Company (NCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult win at a widely-lit election in the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the district with a score of 20 points.
The Democrats have a little bit of a preference for the Democrats.
The U.S. assessed the possibility of punishing El Salvador for China's support, and then stepped down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already supported Beijing's position, despite the slight opposition from Washington, D.C., the statement said.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and moved to a hotel in Panama until his partners ousted Trump's leadership.
Representatives of the State Department have decided to recall U.S. leaders of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with the "recent decisions on the non-recognition of Taiwan", the spokesman said.
However, the sanctions were considered only in relation to El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development, and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include a reduction in financial aid and a targeted restriction on the issuance of visas, would be painful for the country of Central America with its high level of unemployment and killings.
At the conclusion of the internal meetings, representatives of the North and Central America postponed the holding of a high-level conference, devoted to security and economic prosperity, which would be a continuation of a similar meeting in the past and in the future.
But by mid-September, the high-ranking officials of the administration continued to understand what they wanted the conference to take place and actually stopped consideration of the issue of Salvador's punishment.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at a conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, in a sign that the administration is advocating for the conduct of the event.
And the three U.S. envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or punishments from Washington, D.C.
The White House spokesman, Mr. Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debates, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues on condition of anonymity.
Their messages are confirmed by another, close to the administration of the analyst, who also wished to remain anonymous.
Let's learn the history
The next step could be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, about the examples of what is currently very difficult to prove in documents of a public nature.
It is reported that M<0xC3><0xBC>ller drew attention in the investigation into the possibility of Trump's and Russia's renegade in an attack on the election.
If Congress changes the host, Mr. Trump will appear before the face of responsibility to this body, just as he prepares to speak again to the electorate, and, perhaps, ultimately, to the jury of his colleagues.
There are many “ifs” and I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable, just like he is in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make a choice that will determine how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West would turn against him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have suffered a failure and have missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of blood transfusions.
The story revolves around such turning points, and the relentless march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
Right now, the United States has faced a few of these turning points.
What will happen if Mr. Trump is fired by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the newspaper wrote about the fact that last year he secretly offered to write down the words of the president and considered his prerogative.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the translation of "The Times" is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh’s case is not comprehensive or fair, or if it is upheld in the Supreme Court despite the well-deserved reliance on allegations of sexual misconduct?
And first of all, are we going to vote in the elections for Congress, which will bring Mr. Trump to justice?
If we don't pass these tests, there will be a long winter for democracy.
But I don't think we'll be disappointed by the lessons I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak habreica who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my missionary home.
She survived, immigrated to America and after 60 years sent me to light the Sabbath candles on this swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be an optimist about our future?”

Graham Dorans from Rangers is optimistic about the pre-match match with Rapide Vena
The Rangers take on Raped Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after an impressive nothing in Spain over the Villarreal at the beginning of this month will allow them to confidently leave the G-League group.
The length of the knee prevented half-back Graham Dorans from performing for the first time in the season to no more than 2-2 with Villareal, however, he believes that Rangers will be able to use this result as a trump.
“It was a significant match for us because Villareal is a strong opponent,” the 31-year-old said.
“We started the game thinking we could get something and we made good money.
Maybe we could have killed the ball in the end, but nothing in general has also been a good result.
They looked better in the first half, but in the second we took each other's hands, and we had the best half of the field.
There will be another significant event for European football on Thursday night.
I hope we can earn three points, but it will be a difficult game, as they showed a good result in the last game, but given the crowd of players on the stands, I'm sure we will be able to beat them and show the sound
"Last year was tough, both because of my injuries and the change in the club itself, but now we have a confidence factor.
The team is good, and the guys really get pleasure from the game; the trainings are productive.
Hopefully, we will be able to move forward, surpass the result of last season and succeed.”
Women lose their sleep because of the fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the participants of the survey had an accurate idea of what they wanted for themselves, few of them spoke about it with members of their families.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study reported that they had talked to their husbands about the cat's long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to discuss it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide for life insurance.
Here's what to start with.
Think about it with your husband and children: your family won't be ready to help you if you don't fulfill your wishes in advance.
Work with a consultant and family and discuss where and how to get medical help, as this choice can become an important factor in determining the cost.
Get in touch with a financial advisor's discussion. He can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy, which will help cover these expenses or you can self-insur your life – save your life.
Let's take a look at the legal documents: Predict legal battles.
Get confidence in the medical service to appoint a trusted person to control your medical care and to ensure that your wishes are fulfilled by specialists in the event that you are unable to speak up.
In addition, consider the possibility of issuing a trust in the management of the finances.
Assign a trusted person to make financial decisions and secure the payment of your accounts if you are insolvent.
Don't forget about the details: Imagine that your injured father needs immediate medical care, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about the use of drugs and the presence of allergies?
Write down these details in a written form to be ready to go.
“Not only financial issues but also the professionalism of doctors play a role,” adds Martin.
“What kind of medicine do we need?
Who will take care of the dog?
We have to plan everything.”
In Ilfracombe, a man was shot several times with a pneumatic windshield
The man got a few hits with a pneumatic winch when he went home at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, waist and arm.

Earthquakes and Tsunami in India
According to officials, at least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pula on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to grow.
Due to the disconnection, the perpetrators engaged in humanitarian aid were unable to get any information from the Dongal regent, a region north of the Pole, which is located closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-point earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in the city after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Paul and Dongal on the island of Sulawesi:
The Pole is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people as of 2017.
When the earthquake occurred and the tsunami came, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the foundation.
Dongala is a regency that extends over 180 miles (300 km) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Regency – administrative unit with status below the province, in 2017 there were 299,200 people.
Fishing and farming are the basis of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
The production of nickel is also important for the province, but mainly concentrated in Moravia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Mitigation of the Consequences of Natural Disasters, the Poles and the Dongals have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by the tsunami in Dongal, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Dongal in 1996, resulting in the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically-active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly rocked by earthquakes.
Below is a list of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indian province of Acheh in the north of Sumatra on December 26 caused tsunamis, which struck 14 countries, resulting in 226,000 deaths along the entire coast of the Indian Ocean, and an estimated 226,000 deaths per year.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes erupted on the western coast of Sumatra in late March-early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, resulting in the deaths of about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred in the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-point earthquake occurred on one of the islands of Mentawa outside Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the regency of Piji Jaya in Acheh province, causing devastation and panic, as he reminded people of the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the tsunami did not come, but more than 100 people died under the rubble of the buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the tourist island of Indonesia Lambok, resulting in the deaths of more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake has destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists without the possibility of leaving.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence in the family
Track Paylin, the eldest son of former Governor of Alaska and vice-candidate to President Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of assault.

Earthquake in India, tsunamis: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people were killed as a result of an earthquake on the Indian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-point earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and network connections are not working, and it is expected that the number of victims will increase in the coming days.

The federal prosecutor's office has called for a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York.
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Saiful Saipov, a suspect in a New York terror attack that killed eight people - a rare punishment that was not used in the state for federal crimes of 1953.
Sapov, 30 years old, in October allegedly used a hired truck of the company "Home Depot" to get on a bicycle path along the chassis of the West Side in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death sentence, according to the statement about the intention to obtain the death penalty, imposed in the Southern District of New York, the prosecutors must prove that the Saipov "intentionally" hit eight people and "intentionally".
According to the materials of the court, for both offences a possible measure of punishment in the form of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the high-ranking federal investigating judge, Akhenaten Saifov, filed an indictment with 22 points, which included eight counts of murder in support of the racket; this is usually a felony.
According to prosecutors, the attack called for “ancient and deliberate planning”, and describing the crimes committed by Saipav, used such phrases as “early, harsh, and disheartened”.
"Saifula Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, caused damage and brought loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelina, Nicolas Cleves, Ana-Lora Decadt, Darena Drake, Ariela Eralia, and Elena Erna
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last criminal case was opened in the form of a death penalty in the Southern District of New York City.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty in New York City on a federal case was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were punished after they were convicted two years earlier for conspiracy to commit adultery with the purpose of a spy.
The pair of Rosenbergs were punished on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sapov, who is leaving Uzbekistan, according to court documents, demonstrated the lack of evidence of conscience in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said that he was pleased with what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saifov told the authorities that his attack was inspired by a review of the Islamic State's video surveillance on the phone.
He also asked for permission to carry the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital palace, the police said.
He does not recognize himself guilty in the indictment, which consists of 22 points.
David Patan, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "absolutely disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision on the application of the death penalty, not on life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the pain of these events for all participants,” Patan said.
The defense team of Saipov had earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A member of parliament from Tory says Nigel Farage should hold talks on Brexit.
Today, during a protest at a Tory party conference, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army”.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel discomfort” from the Eurosceptics – as one member of parliament, Teresa May, offered her candidacy for talks with the EU.
A member of parliament from the Conservative Party, Peter Bowen, said during a march in Birmingham that Britain would have "gone out" if Mr Farage had taken office as secretary for Brexit.
But the problem that Mrs. May faced in trying to match up with her disparate supporters was even worse when the Tories, who are advocating for EU membership, staged a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister of all powers is trying to preserve the compromise agreement of the Czech Republic under constant pressure from supporters and supporters of the exit, as well as the EU itself.
The Allies insist on trying to make a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and want to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between it as a package and “disagreement”.
Mr. Bowen said at a rally in Salihal "Leave Means Leave" that he wanted to "get Chucker off the board".
He proposed that Mr Farage should be made equal and set out the obligations for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were responsible, we would have left,” he said.
A member of parliament from Wellington added: “I am in favour of Brexit, but we need to get away from the Chekker plan.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We didn’t wage world wars to be dependent.
We want to enforce our own laws in our country.”
Mr. Bowen rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay is completely irrelevant to the reality.”
Braxita's supporter and Thora's member Andrea Jenkins was also on the march, and in an interview with reporters she said: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Czech plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and activists who actually go out on the street and choose us.
Please give up the plan and start listening.” <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In a brief address to Mrs. May, she added: “The Prime Minister remains in office when he fulfills his promises.”
Mr Farage said politicians needed to be forced to “feel discomfort” when they were going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – people and politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘This won’t get you out of your hands.’”
In his address to the captured crowd, he added: “I want you to make those of our politicians who are ready to betray Brexit feel uncomfortable.
“We will mobilize the people’s army of this country, which has given us victory in Brexit, and we will never rest until we become independent, self-motivated, proud of the United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the workers of the exit passed through Birmingham, before holding a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
Several activists have been waving Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against Brexit) banners after the group's launch this weekend.
The Labour Party's Lord Adanis has raised concerns over the Conservatives over the security issues they faced because of the party program at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have ready-to-use IT systems and all the technologies for Canada plus, for a no-training limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the process of voting for the president's post
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she would “return full attention to the process of voting for the presidency.”
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about her future during a joint rally in western Massachusetts, the United States.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is about to run for re-election, opposed by Republican Party member Jeff Jill, who was Trump's co-chairman in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of discussions as a possible rival to Trump in 2020.
Since Trump's inauguration, it has been the 36th meeting with voters in the form of a general meeting that took place on Saturday in Hali<0xC3><0xB6>k.
One of the participants asked if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to “go to Washington to fix a broken government, and for that a woman should be in charge.”
The arrest occurred after the death of basketball player Simms from the team of Louisiana State University
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced that the suspect in the murder of basketball player ISL Wade Sims had been arrested on Friday.
The Batton-Rouge Police Department announced the shooting of 20-year-old Dean Simpson during a press conference that took place at 11 a.m. Eastern time.
On Friday, they published a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who was featured on it.
The 20-year-old Simms was shot Friday morning near the campus of South University.
“Waid Simms suffered a gunshot wound to the head as a result of which he died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade stepped in for a friend and was shot by the Simpsons.
During the interrogation, Simpson confessed to being at the scene of the crime, was armed and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not object to the raid and was taken under guard in the police department of the East Baton Rouge district.
Sportsman-Juneer with a growth of 6 feet, 6 inches (201 cm) grew in Baton Rouge, the Sims last season played in 32 games, of which 10 were on the scoreboard from the start, on the average spent on the scoreboard 2,9 minutes, and 5 minutes, respectively.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after winning a victory over Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Fethel on an insider's contract
Since Walter Bottas warned on Saturday at the Lewis Hamilton qualifier race, it has become clear that the orders within the Mercedes team play a significant role in the race.
Bottas pulled out a good spot on the varsity and almost left Hamilton on the loose, as he defended his place on the first two creeds and asked Fetella to attack his friend on the team.
Fettel first went on a pit-stop and left Hamilton to fight at the end of the overall mass of the riders, which was exactly what this maneuver had to become.
The pilot "Mercedes" went on a pit-stop on the lap later and went out behind Fetel, but Hamilton came out ahead after a few round-and-round maneuvers that forced the driver "Ferrari" to leave the cockpit in the inner space.
Max Farstappen, on his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the net and was in seventh place by the end of the first round.
He then led most of the race while keeping the tyres, because he wanted to finish quickly, beat Kimi Ryanen and take fourth place.
As a result, he went on a pit-stop on the 44th lap, but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight laps, so Raikanen took fourth place.
It's been a tough day because Walther's all weekend performances were fantastic and he's made himself a real gentleman if I'm allowed to say so.
“The team has done a great job of taking first and second place,” Hamilton said in a statement.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dwayne Finstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting that it was not the source of the leak of Christina Blaise Ford's letter, in which she accused the candidate of being a judge at the Verkhovna Rada.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not turn directly to Ford’s statements to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what is happening in the Senate showed how people can be “indecent and unkind”.
“The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger when you see evil, ugly, and lying people,” he said.
“When you read about press releases and leaks, then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
You remember?
Diana Finstein, is this your escape?
Remember her answer... you lost the document – “Oh, oh, what?
No, no, no.
There was nothing from me.”
Wait a minute.
We let the escape... No, we didn’t,” he added, citing the senator.
Finstein sent a letter in July detailing the allegations that Ford had made against Kavan, and he fled in early September—but Finstein denied that the escape had occurred from her office.
“I didn’t cover up Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t let her run away from her story,” Finstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
“She asked for the story to remain confidential, and I satisfied her request.”
But her refusal probably did not please the president, who commented on it during the Saturday rally: “Here’s what I’m telling you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t do it, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the candidate in the Supreme Court, accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats are using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to return power to themselves by any means.
You see the terrain, the scale, and they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control,” the president said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundy Stars – Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwayne killed two wickets for the Giants in a match against Dundee
Dandy Starrs played for Friday's injury, which was inflicted on them by Belfast Giants as part of the Elite League, winning a 5-3 return game in the home game on Saturday.
Thanks to Patrick Dwyer's and Francis Bauille Jayants' strike, they led on two shifts in the beginning.
Michael Sullivan and Jordan Cooney were the same number before Dwayne restored the leadership of the Giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bushar of Dundee equalled the number, after which Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured the team a victory with two goals.
It became the third parasitization in the Elite League for the season for Adam Kiff's team, who defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
The teams met for the fourth time in a season; in the previous three games, the Giants won.
The first goal in the fourth minute of the match (03:35) was scored by Dwayne Dueyer from the hands of Kendall McFol, and four minutes later, Baville doubled the score after the hands of David Rutherford.
In the revived first period (13:10) Sullivan discovered the number on the side of the field masters, and then Cohen equalized the number after the transfer of Matt Marquardt (15:16).
Dwayer secured the Giants' lead as he made his first stop, killing his second hideout for the meeting at the end of the first period.
The receiving side regrouped, and Bushar rescheduled the account, killing the chess player with the team's medical advantage (27:37).
Coun and Charles Carcoran helped Nielsen take Dundee to the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the win along with the team's fifth number in the middle of the final period.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are playing their last game in a home game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies, saving hundreds of passengers from the earthquake
The air traffic controller in Indonesia died heroically, ensuring the successful take-off of the plane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many disappeared without news after a major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday caused by a tsunami.
Strong underground raids are still ongoing, and many people are buried under rubble in the city of Pal.
Despite his colleagues having runaways, 21-year-old Antonio Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the dispatcher's altitude, which was wildly docked at the airport of Pal Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
It remained in place until the board of the 6321 company "Batik Air", which was at the time on the runway, landed off the ground.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he decided that it was going to be destroyed.
He later died in the hospital.
According to the Australian program ABC News, according to the representative of Air Navigation Indonesia Johannes Sirait, the decision of the dispatcher may have saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was supposed to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter went to Paul's.
“Our hearts are broken,” he added.
Meanwhile, the country's authorities are cautioning that the number of victims could reach several thousand, and the agency's threat reduction agency claims that access to the city of Dongal, Sigi and Button is limited.
Sutopa Purva Nugroh, the agency’s representative, said: “Perhaps the number of victims will continue to increase, as many bodies have still not been able to recover from the rubble.”
The flames, which reached up to six meters, devastated Paul, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
The military and commercial aircraft are carrying humanitarian aid to the country.
Risha Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the car “quickly” brings bodies.
Don't drink clean water.
There are shops all over the place.”
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help those who survived, but we don’t know what awaits them here.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesia's President Jok Vidoda arrived in Paul on Sunday and told the soldiers: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, in Indonesia, more than 550 people have been killed by earthquakes in Lambok.
A plane crash in Micronesia: according to "Air Niugini" report, one person has disappeared without news after the plane crashed in the lagoon
The airline, which carried out a flight that made an emergency landing in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, had previously claimed that all 47 passengers and the crew were happily evacuated from the plane, which was sinking, and now unresponsive.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday, it could not give a report on the whereabouts of a single passenger-man.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately report the details of the passenger; for example, his age and nationality.
The local boats helped rescue the rest of the passengers and the crew after landing the plane on the water in an attempt to land at the airport on the island of Chuvk.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday; all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash, as well as the exact sequence of events, remains unclear.
According to reports, both the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon, not reaching the landing strip.
According to some sources, the plane has crashed into the airfield.
According to the American passenger, Bill Janes, the plane was flying very low.
“It’s very successful,” Janes said.
According to him, he and others were able to cross the belt in the water before the emergency exits of the plane, which had already been dancing.
He said that the pilots panicked and began to scream, as well as that he had received a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that the marquees, which docked near the port, also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to the shore, until the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in the crash of aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea over the past twenty years, but none of them belonged to “Air Niugini”.
An analyst restores the course of events at night when a woman has been burned alive
On Saturday, the indictment concluded the presentation of evidence in the review of the case of a man who is accused of burning a resident of the state of Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice for several hours, showed that he was an attractive expert in the field of information analysis.
He described the jury as using recordings from mobile phones to learn about the moves of 29-year-old Quinton Taylor and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
As reported by The Clarion Ledger, according to Rowlett, he received news of the location from several mobile phones that showed that Taylor was with Chambers on the eve of her death, which contradicts his previous statement.
When data that his mobile phone was near Chambers's phone at a time when, according to him, he was confirmed along with his friend Michael Sentry, the police were directed to ask Sentry.
Senfard gave the demonstration on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in the city that day.
When asked by the prosecution if Telis was telling the truth about Senfard being in the van that night, he said that he was “liaring because my van was in Nashville.”
Another controversy was that of Taylor's claim that he had been acquainted with Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The records from mobile phones showed that they knew each other for a week.
According to Rowlett, shortly after her death, Chambers Telis removed her messages, calls, and contacts from her phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Haley said.
The side of the defense should start side-by-side discussions on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be referred to the jury later in the same day.

There's another black hole?!
New York girl falls on trial for 'racist' couple for 'rape' post-retirement message
A New York girl is being sued by a married couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message from her mother that she is “another black woman” with a complaint.
The couple denies that they are racists, equating calls for “possibility.”
In 2016, Lindsay Plaska-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed disappointment at discovering that the new nanny, Josel Morris, was black when she arrived on her first working day.
“NEEEEEE, THE WAY OF THE CHARACTERISTICS,” wrote Mrs. Plaska-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent a message to Mrs. Morris twice.
As reported by the New York Post, understanding the mistake, "felt the impossibility" Plaska-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, claiming that the former nanny, who was also an African-American, had been ill-equipped for work, and that I
Mrs. Morris paid for the day's work and sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is on trial and wants to get a waiver in accordance with the terms on which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract: $350 a day for six months with a residence.
“I want to show them that you can’t do that,” she told Post on Friday. “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple rejected the charges of racism, claiming that Morris' dismissal was a reasonable decision, considering that they could not trust her after they had abused her.
“My wife sent her something she shouldn’t have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” said Post’s husband, Joel Plaska.
“Would you trust your children for who you’ve dealt with rudely, even by chance?
your child's?
Isn't it?"
The plaque equates the calls to “opportunity” and reports that his wife was born just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“And you’re going to be stalking a man in that situation?
It’s pretty tough,” added a specialist in investment-banking activity.
Although the judicial deliberation is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, subjecting them to severe criticism of their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Padingtan cautioned that readers will not be able to compete with the bear who is speaking, said in a new letter.
Bond’s daughter Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, wrote about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of the person who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It’s so cool to read this, already knowing about Padingtan’s tremendous success.”
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before he dared to write a children's book about a small teddy bear, was optimistic despite the fact that his work was not accepted and added that it was "the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his final success, speaking of Padingtan, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family.”
“He was a pretty quiet man, and I didn’t get out at all,” she said.
“But since Padingtan was so real to him, it was almost a fatherly honor for a child who did something: you’ll be proud of them, even though it’s not really your merit.
I think that's the key to the success of Padingtan.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave what belonged to Padingtan himself.”
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors fought for her life freely.
"I've been calling over and over regularly to tell you that it's really bad that she can't stand," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse.
“Then I called Nad to say that she was going to die for the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tash, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctors, who gave her heart to be afraid of, slowly left her body.
She died some time ago, and that was the end.
I just had to sit there knowing it was all over the place.
I couldn't stand, cry, or cry, because there were families and people around me.
I had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, who had suffered the loss of her daughter, sat on the plane with the other passengers – and they did not know at all what she had to go through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I tilted my head and there was tears on my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was in the air that I felt a sense of compassion for Neda.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women who are shy of taking out cards to prevent suicide on the bridge. . . .
Two women who have lost their loved ones, who have committed suicide, are doing everything they can to keep other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are handing out cards with warm words and phone numbers that people can get help with on the bridge in Wales.
Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he started depression, and at the age of 18, he died of suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the way I feel,” she said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lidne, said her son was a talented chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
People said that his smile would light up any room.”
However, before his death, he quit his job because he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother's body when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says: “I am constantly concerned that this may have unpleasant consequences.”
Mrs. Davis created the cards, “so that people would know that there are people in the world you can address and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Hasfres, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, has lost Mark, her partner, with whom she lived for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he was sad, or that he was depressed, or something like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude has changed.
On the day of the feast, he was very humbled: when the children opened the gifts, he did not even look at them.”
She said his death was a great trauma for them, but it was necessary to live with it: “There was a huge hole in the family.
It's just killing us.
But we have to keep fighting and fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI begins an investigation
“I thought we could have what he wanted – limited in time and in the scope of the investigation – we could get a little bit of annihilation,” Mr. Blake said on Saturday, adding that he was worried that the committee was “disrupting” because of the fact that the track was missing.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their desperation is sometimes explained.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, when Republicans are expected to suffer from a parasitic disorder, then they will be weakened in their attempts to choose the Supreme Court they need.
George W. Bush called on the senator to lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during Bush's presidency and through him met his wife Ashley, who then worked as Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI's release of its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which now seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes during a vote in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to solve the problem of equality of votes and approve it in the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea has declined under the leadership of Kim Jong-un.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean official said in a statement.
Bo Sun, bringing data from the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the merger, said that last year there were 1,127 refugees, and in 2011 there were 2,706.
Mr. Pak said that the main reasons are enhanced border control between North Korea and China, and higher costs, which have been imposed by the smugglers for the reprocessing.
Pyongyang has not commented on this in any way.
Most of the North's refugees are from North Korea, with the reason why they are granted citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority escapes through China, with which North Korea has the longest border. It is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is very heavily protected.
China considers refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still in a state of war – have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on denuclearization.
This came after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in June in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work with the aim of fully liberating the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Roy Yang Ho accused the U.S. of not making any progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such conditions we are not going to arm ourselves first,” Mr. Roy said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh an "Esterisk", she says he shouldn't work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate in Brett Cavano's Supreme Court an "Esterisk" and said he was not suitable for working in the Supreme Court at his own pace.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t get rid of the idea that if a woman behaved like this, she would be called ‘Esterisk’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s speech to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally objected to the allegations of sexual harassment against Dr. Christina Blaise Ford when they were still teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and couldn't speak when discussing his family and the older classes of the school.
He also explicitly accused Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "a grotesque and organized killing of a person", organized by liberals, who got angry because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's speech showed that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he clearly showed that he had a bias against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the manner in which he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi has denied if she was asked if she will try the Kavanaugh impeachment, if he is elected, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say that if he doesn’t tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, then he not only shouldn’t work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now,” Pelosi said.
At the moment, Kavanaugh is the judge of the District Court of Appeal of the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the law on accessible medicine or in fact the Rows against Wade, because Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing on the confirmation of the position, Kavanaugh did not answer the question of whether he would annul certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Now is not the time for the hysterical, unbiased individuals to work in court and wait for us to say 'how wonderful this is,'" Pelozi said.
A woman should be able to do that.
It's a justifiable speech, months and years of anger just swirling, and she can't remember it without tears.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Stein told me 45 years ago.
“I don’t think it’s that rare.”
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman who was working as a director somewhere, and who said that when she got caught, she was crying, but she was developing a technique of behavior. When she got caught and started crying, she was crying and you were saying to me, ‘You’re crying, you’re crying.
But I'm angry."
I just continued the conversation.
I think it was great.”
Tears are allowed in part as a way out of the sum, because they are absolutely misunderstanding.
One of my most vivid memories from the first job I once cried out in an unrelenting rage, then I was caught by an elderly woman, a restrained chieftain, who always scared me a little bit, and dragged me to the stairs.
“Never let them see you in your tears,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think that you are sad and will be glad that they have given you.”
Patrizia Shrodar, a then-Congress-Democrat from the state of Colorado, worked with Gary Hartham in the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt got into a marriage feud on a yacht called Monkey Business and got out of the presidential race, the very angry Mrs. Schroder believed that she herself could participate in the presidential campaign.
“It wasn’t a very well thought out decision,” she told me, laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates, and I didn’t need them at all.
Someone called this situation “White Snow and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since the company has been gone for quite a long time, she did not have the funds, so she said she would not take part in the elections if she did not collect $2 million.
It was a losing situation.
It turned out that some of her supporters, who sacrificed $1000 to men, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’m going to lose?” she thought.
If she made a statement that she would not participate in the election campaign, she was so strongly caught up in emotions – thanks to the people who supported her, anger at the system, which made it so difficult to get money and was aimed at the electorate, she was angry at the election, and was angry at the election.
“You might think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalled Mrs. Shrodar, a press reaction to her condition.
“It could have been thought that my corporate sponsor is the manufacturer of Kleenex paper napkins.
I've always wondered what they're going to write about on my laptop.
“She was crying?”
Why the trade war between China and the U.S. could be good for Beijing
The first rounds of the trade war between China and the United States were deafening, and since the war is far from over, in the longer term misunderstandings between countries may be in Beijing's favor, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year, taxing China's major export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum, with taxes.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when new tariffs capped goods at a total amount of $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
Each time, Beijing responded in the same way, raising tariffs recently from five to ten percent on U.S. goods at a cost of $60 billion.
China has promised the United States a symmetrical response, and the second-largest economy will hardly be able to keep an eye on it.
In order to force Washington to step down, it is necessary to deepen the demand, but the public bias towards the US is almost unacceptable for Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure of the U.S. trade war in the long run could support China, reducing the mutual dependence of the two countries.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will start the process of a sharp economic downturn is much more dangerous than the observers previously thought,” said Abigail Grace, a deputy secretary of state.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and calls for help in building a country destroyed by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“To date, the situation in the country is more stable and secure, thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists in order to return to a normal life.
We now have all the conditions for the return of refugees to the country that they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and targeted economic measures that have been aimed at improving their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
A further 6 million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the country will not accept aid in exchange for certain conditions or assistance from countries that have been sponsoring the mujahideen.
Europe won the Raiders' Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National field in Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost a match on European soil for the sixth time and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown even when the team of Dutch captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michaelson, who competed the most in the tournament, threw his ball into the water in 3 pairs on the 16th hole, composing this match of Francesca Molinara.
Italian golfer Mallinara played well in all rounds, becoming one of the four players who have passed this field with a score of 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in the current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spies was beaten by a 5 and 4 player with the lowest rating in the European team, Thornburn Olsen from Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Paulter from England, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a has become a player who has more than all won tournaments with a career number of 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t cry today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to return the cup.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help," Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a said after the European team's victory.
He handed over the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who played the legend of American golfer Tiger Woods in a 2&1 singles match on Sunday.
“I’m very proud to have won the Tiger Woods, the man I’ve watched since I was a kid,” said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record number of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
The odd statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and is behind this indicator only from Jack Nicholson.
The American team competed with the exception of Patrick Ryde, Justin Thomas and Tney Fins, who played throughout the tournament in high-end golf.
U.S. captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing game in defense of his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they're bikers.
This morning we were able to show Europe what it was capable of.
We've been fighting.
Let's take off the hat in honor of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the American Golf Association and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
Take off your hat in front of them.
We've been bypassed."
