28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall.
The victim’s brother said that he can’t imagine anyone wanting to harm him, “Finally it went up with him again.”
The body found on Wednesday morning at Westfield Mall was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the San Francisco Department of forensics said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as a murder and the investigations are ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had worked as a chef in Boston before, had earned his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" about his death.
"We're a small team that works like a close family and we're going to miss him painfully," the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and feelings are with Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that, "things finally went up for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother.
He was a kind man with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something, to prepare us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation.
He was the brother who floated with the current.
“With everything going wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond that shone brightly every day,” he said.
Anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD’s emergency telephone number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
This was made clear by the Hollywood star in an interview.
“I’m always stuck in drawers or get glued from outside labels that usually have little to do with me and the reality.”
“I don’t always want to be perfect and successful.”
“To be honest, these things are pretty good to me.”
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of a TV with loose dutt and Mexican food, the magazine says.
To white blood, she raises the question of the child's wish: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," according to the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is Not a Child's Game", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will run with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer wins the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is predictable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues looked for a little variation with an exit on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their festive evening, they chased home to the feeding troughs in the rapid gallop.
A mile at this pace, I was afraid.
“It wasn’t a good experience,” Langer says.
And so the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany’s best golfer of all time – 101 tournament victories – was again close to horses.
He and his family were guided by the ALRV, and he didn’t even jump on a horse for photographic purposes.
Langer was in Aachen for the first time and therefore also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
During a small gala, the German Sports Aid handed over the Golden Sports Pyramid to the man from Anhausen.
There is no shortage of awards for the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the Queen of England has taken him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the Sports Pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Winkler on Saturday.
“This award means a lot to me,” says Langer, “because it will not only be awarded for sporting success, but also for social engagement.”
For decades, Langer has been promoting young people.
And so he passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. champion was included in the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the outstanding athletes are Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, Turner Eberhard Gienger, Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, Judoka Frank Wieneke and Algerich Handbaich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company migrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Clinton's and Trump's economic policy: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade deal – both Clinton and Trump want to do so.
However, the two U.S. presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a question of principle.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns of how the state can harm the economy – with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be very different, Trump said.
It will push back on regulations massively, and it is pushing for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates – for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: “The state has certain tasks to do, it has opportunities to open up to the disadvantaged, and it needs money for that.
That’s why taxes on the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say almost the same thing.
The Democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are, for example, strictly rejected by the state-critical Tea Party wing of Republicans.
So there could be internal party discussions on Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and boost coal production in the U.S.
Oil production is also expected to be possible in previously protected areas, which he wants to cancel the Paris climate agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with her investment program, calling for: “A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs.”
"It's probably going to be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the United States from international trade – but simply to better protect American jobs.
They should also be paid better, for example, Clinton demands.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says: The minimum wage has to go up, then he says it must not be changed.
However, the major discussion of the coming months is likely to develop around the tax policy of the two camps.
On one side is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics are urging him to make the budget deficit only even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least the rich to demand that they pay more taxes, and whose critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every refugee woman has experience with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who run away on their own, almost in everyday life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby that is at most one year old.
One of them put her little boy in her arms.
He looks curiously into the room with great eyes.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the area manager of Condrobs, a social assistance provider in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run, among other things.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the M<0xC3><0xBC>nchner Frauenhilfe.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men – not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
“It’s not exaggerated to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her escape,” Bahr says.
“Men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a carrier of hope,” she says.
In women, other reasons for escape prevail: "Many secretly steal from it because they see no other way out".
In their home country, they have experienced sexual violence, rape, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives her on.
On the run, this goes on.
“The fact that a tow truck requires a sexual act for a bottle of water, for example, is not a rarity,” says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Those who believe that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is wrong, Bahr tells.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and, worst of all, abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children have certainly not been born voluntarily".
Many women are so used to it that they say nothing.
“Or they don’t trust to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too great.”
As they often do not know how to help themselves, it needs more accommodation just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for accommodating refugees.
To the question of whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answer with no.
In the Upper Palatinate and the Upper Franks, for example, there is no such thing in government housing.
Even in Swabia, refugee women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, a spokesman for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are in some community accommodation floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it states: "It is very important that men and women be accommodated separately."
"If privacy fails or men and women are housed together, violence against women can occur - continuous".
Above all, the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible for women, the study says.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be read on the Andrang, which is available on the house in Munich.
“Since we’ve talked about it, we have a long waiting list,” says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Auxiliary doctors strike: demands for new anti-labour measures
Deputy medical assistants have called on their trade unions to approve new anti-labour measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked its entire council to approve more work-related measures from early September.
The JDC said ministers would have failed to address concerns about the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract that was agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government would have remained "hardly quiet" to problems, which led to the rejection of the contract.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and has called for official renegotiations of all your concerns."
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Executive Board today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating work-action measures beginning in early September.
The controversy led to assistant doctors striking six times this year, the first total failure in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA Assistant Physician Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the sessions, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract should be advantageous and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would necessarily be introduced.
Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of Foreigners"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomes his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can’t help but think that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin’s smile seemed narrow-eyed and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "loved friend" Putin - according to a report a whole five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me to suggest the opposite.
But a radiating, sustainable cold from Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting down of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was fierce.
Putin split up and accused Ankara of falling in the back of Russia.
The crime was even greater as it was committed by an alleged friend.
Rebuilding the trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
All of a sudden it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious allegations by senior officials were that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syrian territories controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently disputed this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.
Russia had some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a cease-fire are clear.
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was sacked last month in a failed coup d'état almost his office.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.
But there are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard – particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late-season storm to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West, considering its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.
To this end, there is the continuing gulf over the sniffing pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin – who is eager to take advantage of the cold mood and reduce Turkey’s relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for claiming support for the elected bodies after the attempted coup d’etat.
This is a self-evident fact for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit meeting at this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present one, as one analyst once described me, an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that have strayed from the West and feel ill-treated and are now allied.
Yet, despite the public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference stated that they had not even deleted the topic.
The president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostilities – and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet – it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
According to the bank’s CEO, the RBS brand should be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since it had to be nearly collapsed and saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists "RBS" used to protect other end-consumer financial brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, decentralized headquarters and stock exchange listing will change to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the private customer business that will get more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed as we now become more of a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to develop into the bank of brands, because how do we focus internally (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see a lot of changes.
We can re-launch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th win
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He put on Predilection, which is coached by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He followed Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
Three-time winner Dettori, who had previously won on Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too.
I’m very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori takes the plunge when he gets the victory on predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been inspiring fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already made 6,000 wins if he wasn’t just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has ridden in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the epitome of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A number of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially had difficulties returning from his six-month ban, but he showed an impressive character strength to fight his doubts and return to his best form.
And he’s not finished yet – Dettori has said before that he wants to continue competing until at least his 50th year of life.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
For many years, Ivanov was part of Putin’s closest circle of trust.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In a statement, the Kremlin said that Putin, without stating any reasons, “ordered the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration.”
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin’s website it says (in Russian) that he was later head of protocol and chief of staff of government personnel.
Speaking about his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the government’s most important task to support your work as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince you?
This step has made Moscow a mystery.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest friends and works as he did for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, the two men claimed that the chief of staff is resigning at his own request.
But despite the smiles for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
No one knows at the moment.
But the official claim — that a man once hailed as a potential president wants to lead Russia’s environmental policy at once — was met with great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said “it is true that I asked you in a conversation in early 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post – one could almost say – difficult post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once believed that after Putin’s second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, as a third term would have violated Putin’s constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before becoming president three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson Fired After Hitting Producers
Last month, Gibson was involved in a physical confrontation at the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its cancellation in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his resignation.
There were artistic differences and differences of opinion on the set.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson’s character from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been in the series since the first season of the series in 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have been putting all my heart blood into it for the past 12 years,” Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is set for September 28.
Mysteries about fish that landed in the garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that these could be the 75 fish that were spied out by a spring.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "roof blowers" that approach completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
Fife’s bridge section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 oblique ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to cross the bridge from the country.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
In total, almost 79% of all bridge decks are in their place, and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth gets a concrete kick for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge in its place.
Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure represents a significant milestone for every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking high- and low-rise construction.
After the installation of the last road deck section and its connection to the north tower deck under construction, we then had to close the remaining gaps on the north or country side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an increase of about 3%.
Heikel, as the tolerances the team is working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men have "happiness to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after being thrown off their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck an alarm on Friday at 13:20 BST after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely while their boat moved on from its own strength.
“We saw the boat revolving around her and imagined the worst,” said Vince Jones, the head of Moelfre’s rescue station.
“Fortunately, the strong winds have already pushed the boat beyond its range until we let it to water,” he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coast rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and unharmed.
The boat engine had an emergency stopper, but it got rid of the person who steered the boat when the boat was docked.
Someone has been watching over these men today.
Severely Injured - Man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured her.
As police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrator cut off the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When she came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
He then alerted his sister.
Together with her life partner, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her life partner.
On the road, they met the man’s ex-girlfriend.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig?
The SPD and the Greens believe that in the future, investors will be much more committed.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 affordable apartments in the next few years?
The SPD is proposing a "action concept of living" for the next Council meeting.
However, the dispute is programmed.
First of all, it is about the question: Who should actually build the cheap apartments?
There is a lack of regulation so far.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: “We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, you will need to show 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments in the future.”
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in stock.
However, the big point of contention in the town hall is, says Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
“We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent, of apartments as social housing.”
A new urban housing funding program, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the factions."
The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.
The left wants tough conditions for investors.
In spite of this, Bratmann said, an increase in the situation in the housing market is on the rise.
If the concept of action is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear if we will get the experts.
But the program is not yet complete: because the around 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway.
But how do you balance the loss of around 1300 more affordable apartments, whose promotion will expire in the next few years?
By 2020, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm said, out-of-bounds should now be purchased from the city.
In addition, it should be thought about getting apartments back into the price bracket.
This is possible in the western city.
At one stroke, the problem could be solved.
Because in the western city deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be taken back to the price tag for affordable apartments.
Only: This is what the owners, the housing companies do not want.
Because the number of social apartments in the western city is once again drastically increased, one moves away from the goal of the so-called mixing.
There is no longer a concentration of Social Weaknesses in only a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat."
Although it has focused on more construction sites for single-family houses.
However, that does not mean that there is no compromise yet.
Pokémon Go, a quest for health and happiness that’s worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens has been complained to many over the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the couch and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially on the TV, then on video games and lastly on smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go madness, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).
Like many pop culture phenomena, interest declined slightly before the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The market introduction in other countries was pushed by the massive demand that overburdened the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go out with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and once found can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation that played the game when she was even younger joined the craziness and ran for the couch.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in steps that the “average” person takes back every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s market launch, the number of people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who’s playing Pokémon Go – it just looks at the raw data to boost performance.
Many public health education campaigns that want to get people to “take 30 minutes to get out of the couch” and “be active every day” hit deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
Those who regularly exercise reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead you here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are humorous game spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's the matter?
A breakthrough has been made.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity before, they didn’t give us a reason to play sports the way this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will be abandoned over time.
However, due to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world while helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in women's watches
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
Hardly on the bar.
Breathtaking on the ground.
On the whole brilliant.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American tournamentr climbed to the multi-game title and widened the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American women Simone Biles turns on the swing during the women's singles final in the art tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-stakeholder title and the fifth overall, while she cements her reputation of being the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.
This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought her sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 World Champion medals – including 10 Gold medals – with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is “the best tournament I’ve ever seen.”
She was expecting a final exam in Brazil, a competition that didn’t go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be considered a disappointment.
American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the women's single-match finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday while serving as a call sign at the farewell ceremony of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted that during her long journey to the top, never having planned the future, this is not really true.
Part of their ground exercises – which include their typical tumbling pass – are tuned to Latin American music that would fit on the street at home outside the Rio Olympics.
It's no coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym, in which Boorman trained, came to power.
She has not lost a multi-competition competition since the summer of 2013, a winning series that will last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture was blurry.
Swivel bars and floor towers - in which Biles holds the world title - were laurels.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the swing bar - and set another on it with a 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman hugged her gently as she expected her final result – a pure formality – and tears flowed on Biles bright red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once described in her collection became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she was fighting for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebreak.
This time, the 22-year-old crew captain, called by the Americans "Oma", had a lead.
After her ground exercise, she threw kisses at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
As far as Biles is concerned, the fast-spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims killed in serial murder case while listening to music in car
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix’s first serial murder while they were chatting in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis’ daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a drive-in, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, according to the report.
Police said the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two more injured in Spanish residential areas within four months in nine attacks.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
It is believed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died on the spot.
One witness told police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like most of his peers, Edmund has microzephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't make it.
I can't do that.
That's what I didn't get into.
Which is not at all true -- of course, you have agreed to it," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to propose to institutionalize him.
"My first response to that was, 'I didn't know people were still doing it,'" Picciuto said.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund could not sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still can’t speak.
But he is making slow progress.
He can walk with support and ride a bike.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund designed for "Please Sing Me Something Before."
“We bring him sign language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking myself, what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven’t asked for the forecast for a long time, because I don’t expect it to be able to tell me anyone.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding gives rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call the state of emergency on Friday, with more rainfall expected throughout the day.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and that aid to the communities concerned was already underway.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is used across large parts of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service indicated that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
A flood warning system was used in southern Alabama on Friday while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The River Comite near Baton Rouge and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels after the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that downstream flooding in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas over the tributary rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams were still reaching people from the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts of southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and step-son were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose sharply overnight.
He said he had been warned by another step-son living nearby.
"We woke up and the water flowed and flowed in," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife, Hansford, said she had never seen such an elevation of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who could swim.
Hansford said all three of them had been rescued in a large military truck and taken to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding had "spread rapidly" as there continued to be heavy rainfall and that authorities are considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone from midnight until Friday morning reported 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said that the soil has been significantly wet since Wednesday due to the rains.
Authorities said heavy rains and street flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and a school dropout in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary broadcaster WWL reported that a deputy in Tangipahoa 200 reported flooded houses.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which were now flooded.
Robby Miller, head of the community, said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who were washed away by floodwaters.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuees.
“As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes,” he said.
In the town of Hammond in the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents to take, hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his data, a handful of houses were reported as flooded on Thursday, but so far none have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "holed by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time this week that a 6-year-old child is shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered several gunshot wounds, including in the thigh, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the broadcaster.
I just can't believe it.
The boy's condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy’s family informed the transmitter that he is expected to be cured again.
He should have started the first class in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical condition, the broadcaster reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are investigating whether they could be among the injured men of the perpetrators.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to be a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridge casings for assault rifles, which were traced back to various assault rifles, oversaw the torture.
It seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the walkway, there were sleeves.
So there seems to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi of the Philadelphia Police Department told the broadcaster.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and police are currently reviewing the surveillance video, according to reports.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbow on her arm when she played outside her home in the West Oak Lane residential area.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I imagine in the women’s Olympic team in the tournament, and that’s for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls of different skin color.
The structure of this team, which Aly Raisman is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one female tournament winner was an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fight event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the pinnacle of this sport, but that’s not how turn classes across the country look like.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five", because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that touring is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishing, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their Turners and families).
The majority of these turn clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the Turners receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started touring.
We need to provide the communities with countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, with a more affordable and accessible turnaround.
I founded my 20-year-old gymnastics foundation.
At my events we offered free and affordable tours in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality tours that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as educational and professional success.
It’s the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to take an interest in the tournament and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you for being so motivated by so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women will become.
Assisted Doctors Want to Organize More Strikes After Rejecting Jeremy Hunt's Proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected him.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract by force, saying the NHS was in a “nobody’s country” and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are expected to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA’s Assistant Physicians Committee, said in a statement last night: “Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will justify the current staffing crisis, and that all will be treated accordingly.”
At just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress has to be made and time runs out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks were met with reluctance to participate in the government and sometimes with deafening silence.
That was a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made only last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the suspension and address the concerns of assistant doctors".
If he does not do this, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work-fighting measures.
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were included to provide doctors on the strike poster chain coverage.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of the NHS Staff, called on the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: “Working combat measures achieve nothing but the few, but already overloaded teams and service providers and provide patients, caregivers and their families with nothing but worry, distress and disruption.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Physicians and responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other ministries to the concerns regarding prematurity and whistleblowering.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as sending out education in England, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional period, the best training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education leave and gender-specific training in the field of medicine - were the primary source of employment.
The <0xC2><0xA3>2 per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a <0xC2><0xA3>2-per-day medication after authorities have recommended that more people be given it for a longer period of time.
The anti-inhibition drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is given as early as 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS’s NICE regulator has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS’s NICE regulator has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fat-containing material in the artery walls that form linings.
When the coating breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The guideline design of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: “Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke often have disastrous consequences.”
Fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft manual does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
Culture of Political Correctness Makes Election Fraud Bleed in Muslim Areas
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the basis of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud being deliberately ignored in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to “oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
The former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that intimidation of voters for religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up detention tapes outside polling booths to intimidate intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry a certificate with them to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter just has to name his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person’s finger when they cast their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not only against election fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes along with it," he said.
The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that acting mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had “perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way” and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a copy in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
In particular, he expressed alarmingly about the fraudulent choice of letters – in which older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including conducting IDs to prove the identity.
In its report, it states: "As evidence, pressure was put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elders, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that ... state institutions would have deliberately ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric issued 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists editing ballot papers to stop "electors".
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral roll from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before the election.
Use non-removable ink on a person’s finger as soon as they have given up their voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
To carry out systematic checks on a person’s nationality to ensure that they are eligible for election.
A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection.
Prohibits political activists from editing complete ballots and envelopes of ballots.
The police have the authority to set up lockdowns to set up polling stations.
A law amendment that facilitates an accusation of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksrettungsgesetz 1983).
Photographing ban in polling stations.
Requirement that only English can be used in the polling stations (except Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees follow the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "surprising" that after the Tower Hamlet case no criminal record was posted.
"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons sufficiently - according to the high demands in criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "abhack controls" of the electoral registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said: “The court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten this reputation.
Crazy after Kate's cyclist double rider and other famous double-goers from Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio this week got out of hand with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be an impressive double-crosser for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is by far not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, who has his own famous double-crosser – at least not if you’re allowed to believe in social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympians that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Team member of the U.S. team in the archery Brady Ellison, left, is compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate’s double-crosser on the bike track, many people on the internet pointed out how a certain archer of the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio might be.
U.S. archery team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images he sees on Wolf of Wall Street star-like images surfaced.
In fact, the archer got the craziness on social media and admitted that he has been hearing from his childhood that he looks like Leo.
“I don’t see much similarity to myself, except for facial hair,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
“He’s a good looking guy, so I’ll probably take that as a compliment.”
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be even more central this year: the striking similarity between the British far-sighted Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes is said to be able to go through as a double rider for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step higher: This user is of the opinion that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another ongoing comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just sun-brown skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian of Fans has been certified to resemble an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities too
Theory put into space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the pair
A Twitter user stated her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, American football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smiles, which are almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medalist Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologises for his statement that Chinese swimmer "like a pig has died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr. 4x200m Freestyle Swimming Staff outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "was like a milf" and died during the race as "a pig".
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swim relay.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentary team to give more "color", could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like a mief, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, floated the second stage of the 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to close the gap to China.
Audiences across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "like a pig died"???
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the show."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimsuit for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many spoke to him
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize that the comment was broadcast about a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we're sorry that it happened."
CBC finally apologized more than 90 times to people who responded to the comment on Twitter
Commentator Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The network also apologised quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been made possible to be broadcast.
Last night, we quickly apologized to our viewers for the broadcast and to our followers on social media.
To clarify one, Byron’s comments referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by stating that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming team at the CBC Olympics," he said.
"I have relied on the performance of the swimmer and not on them as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyer in Primark outrages over woman trying shameless underwear in the middle of the business
The buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a primark to try on underwear.
To make the situation worse, she mustered what she looked like in it, pulled it out and put it back in the shelf.
She continued to browse and try out four pairs of underwear in a store at Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone.
The Primark store at Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before putting them back in the shelf
A mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she got back on and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing on the sales floor, she took a pair of underpants out of the outlet, pulled out her own pantyhose and pants and tried them out.
“She didn’t even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it – she just stood there, like Oskar.”
“Everyone was staring when she pulled out the underpants again, which she obviously didn’t like because she put them back in the shelf.”
She repeated the same thing with three other underpants before finally deciding that she didn’t like anything, pulled back and walked out.
“She didn’t seem to mind watching someone — or thinking about the person who would possibly buy the underwear she had tried.”
Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take underwear home that someone else had and wasn't washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I got involved, the employees tried to pull the pieces of clothing out of the sale after they went - which is just as good."
“I would hate to go home with a new pair of underwear and find out that another woman was wearing them and pulling out again and they weren’t washed.”
A Primark spokesman said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9th at our branch in Folkstone."
All the products in question have been withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect Yourself with Krav Maga from Gun Attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether you are approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear for your robber.
If you are approached from behind, you should be the first to turn around so that you can see your attacker and “get off the firing line,” says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with the knee in the bar and twist the gun out of his hands as the assailant bends in pain, hit him in the face with the run and move back as they aim the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the firing line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can not shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and pointing the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how it looks like in Mizrachi.
But keep in mind that it’s safest to hand over your money if you’re not a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright shakes his tongue for a guide to the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler underwent a serious examination of his immune system and wheezing reflex – by rejecting some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scoured his train on a Euro rail, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a sink button on a train toilet, and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before spotting each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will be getting into.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of licking the sink button of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his trip through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left him, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public lands at train stations to toilet sinks, the task of his immune system was definitely under a test
“As a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water.”
In the film, he certainly earned his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample scan showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak after its luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.
Mr. Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom.
In the film, he says, "This comes close to the worst thing I've ever smoked in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I won't touch anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We went through crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how they are linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: “Let me say it like this – I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I had instructed him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.”
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was pretty difficult.
I’m glad we’ve made some of these dirty treats on film.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all dairy bacteria surveyed were associated in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they use products that contain added dairy bacteria at least occasionally.
Social family destroyed before deloging Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An associative family left their social apartment after a delogation with a damage of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown out of their estate in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints.
After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls showed striking holes, wooden parts were broken up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.
The family have been relocated and it is believed that they now live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for house management at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the apartment will no longer be repaired.
She said: “It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don’t have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property is likely to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is famous and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons living in the apartment in the meantime and police said the terror the family had inflicted included street fights with baseball batsmen, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, fighting, and cheating.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down, old garbage was found
It was in the estate, where in the past drugs were traded, the wood parts were broken up
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to call the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing forcibly delogized her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended 11-week period to voluntarily withdraw.
The delogation was applauded by relieved neighbors who said their lives had been turned into hell.
One said, "They didn't laugh at anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they are finally gone, it will be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.
On the overcrowded side of the town hall, trash and old toys were thrown down.
He added: "It's a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as delogation is always the last step the Cornwall Housing takes into consideration.
This was a very difficult case as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and convey the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogation on the floor
Homeowners will now have to clean up the trash that surrounds the house
In 2014, police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of <0xC2><0xA3>1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she was found guilty of possession of a Class B drug for commercial purposes.
She claimed that the money for a tombstone was her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
Police say they will delogize tenants who do not adhere to the house rules
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police said the devolution was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not adhere to the house rules.
“This goes for those who think they can act without self-incrimination, as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior,” she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviors that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after a deep-seated military jet overflews beach
Sunsets in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force aircraft set off an incredible landing flight
The Air Force stated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a deep-seated jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military aircraft flying almost in a tangible vicinity over the sunbeds on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up as they began to understandably worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming to them through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: "It flew twice really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the dark and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said that the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to the poor visual conditions due to nearby surface fires, but the air forces insisted that security was not at any time compromised.
This summer, surface fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland, which also killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - strong fog and fire - which limited his vision.
The aircraft was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise.
Supercup: Barca with worries against Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona will fight on Sunday for the first step to the first title win in the new football season.
In the duel, the Catalans will advance to the Spanish Super Cup outside against FC Sevilla, and the replay will take place three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner must miss Neymar in the power show with the inferior cup finalist and reigning Europa League champion, among others, who is contesting the Olympic football tournament with Brazil.
Also missing is Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen.
During the training, the German suffered a band-aid in his knee, thus clarifying the query at Barca at least for the first time in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for the number one status for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique gave up a clear decision in this regard so far and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen made the appearance in most other applications.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4.
Lionel Messi and Co. didn’t really know how to convince on Wednesday at 3:2 in the Test match against Sampdoria.
Sevilla, in turn, has the 2:3 defeat after an extension in the European Super Cup against Real Madrid and is aiming for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona has so far 11 record-breaking successes in this competition.
Ma Long in his own league on table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympian.
On Thursday in Rio de Janeiro, the 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5,4,4) in a one-sided final.
Thus, the World Rankings-First picked up the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Finals and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese managed to make it to the finals as expected and finished the title with each other.
It was clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympia staircase was the former SVS-N<0xC3><0x96> legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sets and in time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and left their defenders alone in fair competition.
"I've played the matches so far for my country."
"In the final, I play for myself," Zhang said in a straight line.
After the match, the gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to really fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
After that, he set the pace on the record and left Zhang with only a total of 13 points.
Due to Ma’s superiority, the expected match did not develop.
However, there were not enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the game for bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitriy Ovtcharov, was then in medical treatment, had to "finally" settle for sheet metal.
By the way, Sweden’s Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and J<0xC3><0xB6>rgen Persson (42/2008) had become similarly high table tennis Olympia quarters.
Donald Trump clears ‘major problems’ in election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns, even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the previously Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment in which the usually large-scale and self-confident multi-millionaire expressed such concerns as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals inside his own Republican camp out of the race, doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing.
“We have huge problems in Utah,” Trump told evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in key states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Blame were false reports about his candidacy, he re-recorded his well-known media gossip.
Waking up republican strongholds
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, were on the same page.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered endangered.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton’s advance: “Just as I’ve done so far.”
“This will either be successful, or I’m going to take a very nice, long vacation.”
He does nothing but “tell the truth.”
“If it’s not rich for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s okay,” Trump said.
Then I will return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party is said to have threatened Trump to withdraw funds to support his election campaign, should he not be able to present better polls.
Instead, the Republicans’ candidates for Congress would be more likely to fall into the hands of the poor.
Olympia: Dreister Cheating on Doping Test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee in this case.
Kenya’s athletes are at risk after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraudulent attempt at doping control in the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee agreed to set up a disciplinary committee immediately to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the Kenyan team leader by the doping controllers.
The IAAF World Federation has asked the IOC for information on the case to force its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the IOC's subsequent measures, the IAAF will conduct an assessment," it said in an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and passed out as Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it," Kenya's head of mission Stephan Arap Soi said.
He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, which was on the World Anti-Doping Agency's training controls list.
Ferguson Rotich finished fourth in Beijing World Cup in 2015 over 800 metres.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed his country’s athletes about upcoming doping tests against cash payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return from Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences.
The announcement of the more than 2,000 doping targets imposed by the IOC before the Rio Games was unusually noted earlier that athletes from Kenya and Russia in particular are targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is in accordance with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great racer nation.
The country’s athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of ARD television reports, allegations have repeatedly been raised that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there is supposed to be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
In this way, it could be proved that in this sport was extensively and systematically baptized.
Russia’s athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
It was a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leonard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the Temple of Classics and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra pit, the Sim<0xC3><0xB3>n Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var Orchestra, led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel, shouts: "This music is full of rhythm".
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein’s music in our blood!
In this play, Bartoli plays an elderly Maria.
She remembers her love for Tony with tenderness, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because it’s musically exceptional.
And then there would be Maria’s personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she is smart, of course also na<0xC3><0xAF>ve, and very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, to my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She's an incredibly generous person.
And Bartoli gives back the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Driving is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
These are the same topics, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria.
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, died in Syria, according to reports.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death a few weeks ago in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group’s bulwark in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she intended to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to stop people from ever making that decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months became a widow.
Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in case of an election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland’s confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge in Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said during a telephone conference on Thursday that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with some degree of certainty."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton yet if she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said Clinton’s team would not bother with a new candidate.
Garland is the U.S. Supreme Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, being Lakaien and assistant to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump is unfit for the presidency.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and for men"
Treats Magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats Editor-in-Chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine differed from old-school playboys, as "Playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
It seems to me that the calendar does as well.
“We need to go back to portraying timeless and classic nudity in which both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by these images of a female body,” Shaw said in a press release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight
“Those who don’t adapt and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed suitcases,” said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the G<0xC3><0xBC>len-near Dialog und Welt Foundation.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even become "a hundred thousand", the association's chairman Ali Toprak believes.
Due to the hard work of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community in Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany.
“In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, of several hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition,” said Ali Toprak, president of the “World” on Friday.
Because the government has already covered Kurdish strongholds with criminal offences months ago, 500,000 Kurds inside Turkey are on the run.
After the failed coup, more secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start over in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
“It cannot be that a state that takes in refugees itself produces refugees in its own country,” Toprak said.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevi cities.
In this way, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The head of the federation demanded that the federal government "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters".
There is also a “witch hunt” against Erdogan’s critics in Germany.
I don’t feel safe in Germany for the first time in months.
The German branch of the G<0xC3><0xBC>len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition figures.
The branding as a G<0xC3><0xBC>len follower destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
“Whoever does not adapt and praise Erdogan sits on packed suitcases, by the way, also the Kemalists and secularists,” said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the G<0xC3><0xBC>len-near Foundation for Dialogue and Education, the “World”.
As the newspaper reports on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, before the coup, the Turks represented the largest group of asylum-seekers in Germany recognized for political persecution.
As of June 30, this was 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all asylum-seekers (39,625).
In this survey, those fleeing war, poverty or lack of perspective are not found.
Under the Basic Law, asylum-seekers are exclusively political, i.e., from the state side, individual persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.
In 2021, the national election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the heavy parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it’s not as stupid as it used to be: summer vacation, heat and country day election campaign – that’s all.
The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the voters, are on vacation.
Most holidaymakers who are in the country, on their way to Usedom, R<0xC3><0xBC>gen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country day.
There are practical problems: In the holidays, helpers are hanging posters, blowing up balloons, distributing flyers and counting votes, only trying to drive up.
Until September 4, 2016, the election day and the last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again have an election campaign almost passed by the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it’s also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It is exciting how strongly new AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, is making an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one looks away from his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary proverbial predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Elsewhere, Seeering has gotten cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the AfD’s blooming.
Their refugee policy, their "We create this" has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU, with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to campaign at the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale rallies; Merkel’s Bundestag constituency is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony there than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
“There was probably the majority from other federal states,” Vincent Kokert, secretary general of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently complained in the NDR.
But it’s also not a bad thing to listen to Angela Merkel from other parts of Germany.
Otherwise, the Nordost-CDU largely dispenses with the usual election booths on market squares and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.
This, says Kokert, only plays a “subordinate role”.
The Union has also noticed that you are breaking the ground in the country, that it has to work very hard to find a wire to the people again.
You are like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present in the far reaches of the country.
However, the advice of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his opponents is self-evident: "They have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: village parties, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used".
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD for a particularly dedicated election campaign.
In the last survey, the Social Democrats were 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just barely before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won by 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are expected to make the leap into the national day.
They make of the holiday need a modern virtue and place their campaign largely on the Internet.
"Online election campaign", it calls the country's president Claudia M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
Otherwise, green campaigners go on track to find local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is currently on a houseboat through the Lakes of Mecklenburg.
Your impression: "Wahlebo holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27 Sanitation: Restaurants Suffer from Lockdown
At the speed with which the B 27 is being repaired, there is nothing to smear.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5:30 a.m. and ends only around 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
“They’ve done everything pretty neat,” says Elvira Tetzlaff of the Jet fuel station.
This is a super team.
There is also no delay.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time, until the end of October.
The meeting of those responsible for the construction works is also praised, for example, when it comes to the establishment of relief entrances.
Since the construction site was moved south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Offterdingen has also been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation has relaxed within the place.
The citizens can now drive from the B 27 overland again on both sides.
The escape traffic through the place seems to be going back.
“There were some significant complaints,” said Florian King, Deputy Chief Executive Officer responsible for the traffic management of the renovation.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, Steinlachstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, Hafnerstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many narrow roads were looking for themselves and more familiar with their navi than the signage.
As a result, some trucks were frozen in residential areas.
As the speed limits were also not respected, the municipality strongly called for the measuring vehicle to be fitted.
“There were significant violations,” says King, who once made himself aware of the situation on the spot.
Two to three times per minute have been spent.
The fastest was on the road at 77 km/h in the Tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site was moved on, however, it has become calmer.
For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don’t like to look at the cards.
But that the B 27-sanitation in them has led to revenue inflows, lets everyone you ask look through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "customer", i.e. produce for other companies, for which the refurbishment has hardly any consequences.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "maximum slight decline" at the Maier Motor Show, but also admits that of course "the expertise is lacking".
The most prized are the locals along the road.
J. Albert G<0xC3><0xB6>hner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
That is already a threat to existence.
Not just him, but all the restaurants have hit it "hard".
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy with every euro.
The sales fine refers to “far over 50 percent”.
The road refurbishment has "rejected its operation by two years".
Half of his employees had to be fired.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been fired, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, Prime Minister J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Schmidt answered a question from G<0xC3><0xB6>hner on whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the renovation.
G<0xC3><0xB6>hner knows about other counties where something more generous was handled.
With all the complaints, G<0xC3><0xB6>hner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, it refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests are now less frequently overlooked because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive, it's beautiful somewhere else.
G<0xC3><0xB6>hner has no doubt that his regular clients will return after the end of the renovation work.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, G<0xC3><0xB6>hner maintains the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being scrutinised.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re is now proposing a thick security package.
But what does a state of tolerance have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re gives the conciliator.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, the German Interior Minister said at the presentation of his new security package.
You're not asking anyone over.
Other, further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As interior minister, however, he is on the ground of results and of a “achieveable consensus” within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburg and Ansbach, De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re had some time to pass before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
However, they are now more extensive.
One thing is already known, announced, pointed out: that a new security authority is supposed to take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor does the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and gun law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re starts a second call for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: He wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and cut off the German passport for jihadists with dual citizenship.
“This will be difficult points for the SPD,” admits the CDU man.
However, he considers this reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner does not have a chance at anyway.
A few new ideas presents de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re as well.
They have it partly in themselves: he plans quick procedures for deportations and more possibilities for arresting people before deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought to the country should first have their smartphones checked and social media accounts disclosed for a security check.
In the case of pardons for rejected asylum-seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before — for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disguise their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally weak.
Some of them are still unexplored and leave questions open.
And at some points - in the unequal treatment of sufferers, for example - the question arises: What does this have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be said in Abrede that the assassins of Ansbach and W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in the face of the high number of refugees.
And things that people were deeply concerned about, were not allowed to be outdone even during election campaigns.
The internal security is hugely focused.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburg and Ansbach.
The insecurity is great.
And yes, there are elections.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly involved in the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, it has gone up between the two parties.
First a fierce dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security policy collection of some Union interior ministers, in which the heads of resorts also demand a burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re also strives for conciliatory tones here.
He doesn't think he's going to get a double pass.
We have welcomed the discussion in Germany.
Reopening them does not make sense.
And in the case of a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package is constitutionally sound at all corners and whether it is actually "suspectable" for the coalition partner, must first show itself.
There is a lot in it that could cause controversy.
But the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the issue of internal security.
Party chief Sigmar Gabriel first signals cautious readiness for talks and says: “The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing security.”
Volkswagen is still coming through.
Despite diesel scandals, delivery figures are rising worldwide.
However, not all markets are around.
In the callback function, there is vertebrae around a term.
Volkswagen will start deliveries in the second half of the year.
Europe’s largest carmaker can still show a plus in the current year, despite the diesel industry thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
However, in July, the VW core brand weakened, mainly in Western Europe, and thus again strained the overall sales, as the company listed in the Dax reported.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 449,100 cars than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, after China’s second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the domestic market Germany, deliveries fell by almost one-sixth.
Brand sales chief J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July back to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, there has been a buy-back restriction due to "changed economic framework conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the UK’s vote to leave the EU has also been strained, a spokeswoman explained.
In the U.S., where the exhaust gas deal first escalated, there is also a minus to the beech.
A big support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony is still glimmering through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a drop in deliveries from 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Group sales manager Fred Kappler was able to continue to show a sales surplus from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered to Volkswagen during this time, 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust gas tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW calls around 2.5 million cars for refurbishment to the workshops.
In the course of the refurbishment, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After the refurbishment of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The carmaker issues a "guarantee-like" certificate to the customer after the conversion, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called in corporate circles on Friday.
The reason is legal fines.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for refitted diesel models.
This was confirmed by a VW representative at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has fully complied with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."
"Differences from this are not accepted," Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said, according to the ministry.
VW has taken over the guarantee that no deterioration occurs in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after refurbishment and all vehicle values relevant to the type approval are unchanged.
However, Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, half a year after the refurbishment come into a workshop with a motor damage – and this could result in the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interests of the customer, it is also important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal results in uncertainty as to possible warranty arrangements, as it was called.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will demand criminal interest from wealthy savers in the future – as the second institute in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "There are only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gig or daily money accounts."
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it: normal savers should “not be afraid to pay for their sparring penalty interest”.
If banks deposit money overnight with the European Central Bank (ECB), they will have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest.
This fee will be charged by Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September for deposits of more than 100,000 euros to Giro or Daily Money Accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
“The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future,” Paul said.
He has for a long time kept 40 million euros, which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not use.
“They’re on my central bank account and they’re going to cost 0.4 percent,” he said.
"I can't lay down $4,000 for every million."
The costs will now be passed on according to the causal principle.
Leaving the cash simply in the vaults of the Raiffeisen Bank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four seizures, I don't like the fifth one yet!"
Most customers had understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Only a few of them moved to other banks.
The Association of Cooperatives of Bavaria stated: "The extreme monetary policy rate of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks".
To carry them alone is "permanently not possible in the economy".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association, said: “We do not expect private customers to have to pay comprehensive fees for deposits, for this the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong.”
One banker said on Lake Tegernsee there is "a clientele that is somewhat more abundant equipped with assets".
“This can become a problem for a small bank” if they keep free money.
Founded in 1911, the cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Famous actors, sportsmen and entrepreneurs live in the region.
The cooperative association Bayern "is currently not known to any other banks that calculate a balance sheet for deposits of private customers," said Spokesperson Ernst.
The president of the Federal Association of German People’s Banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), Uwe Fr<0xC3><0xB6>hlich, had stated at the end of June: “The threshold to go into the negative towards the private customer is very, very high”.
Competition is fierce, and it threatens the migration of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not like this in general.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before you go to the comment section, to overseal it under the pseudonym NotAllSinglemenMiddle Ages with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of sound discs is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but rather to Midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased a record are expected to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It’s also not a horde of hobby collectors – it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do the results of YouGov agree?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me as I walk down a busy street in Soho, wear a modest grey suit and stun wildly before I stand, hold my hands and say something decisive like, "So let's take a closer look at that."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though Soho’s heart is slowly bursting with its charm – hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent vendors once lived – there are still a handful of fantastic record specials stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mind through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, who I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20) is a day long because of a meeting in London and going through the shops to fill up the stalls.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I appreciate it," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These sound cards, pictured above (he sent me the snap shot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he couldn’t afford when they appeared and again to buy items he sold when he was young and struggling.
"A lot of the things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a little too young to buy them for me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
This is my burden.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets are on the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who have heard about the comeback and seen themselves buying back their old records.
From the conversations I have had, people have usually gotten rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again,” he says.
This would explain the boom on followers of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took advantage of the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, from items that evoke happy youth memories.
“I think sometimes it can be filling an emptiness or possessing material possessions as a kind of comfort,” says Wez.
As a collector, this is the case, and I think it is the case for many people.
It is an easy way to engage spiritually.
“We are like their social workers!” an employee floats from a record pile.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I browse through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.
“Someone just came in here recently and said, ‘I don’t own a record player, but I’d like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it in the shelf,’” he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product load, less music load.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who only come in slowly.
Fopp, who has dedicated almost an entire floor to the records, has a more colorful audience as I enter.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the shops mentioned above – Wild Beast’s latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz drifts out of the speakers – it’s good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging mental traumas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and is looking at the variety of records available for sale.
She's more of a shopper than a shopper.
She doesn’t deserve much, so collecting records isn’t a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It’s easy to listen to music from a computer or otherwise, but the beauty of records is...” she drifts off with a in love sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While giving the appearance of patterning the jeans hotpants, I observe a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plate art".
But given that any attraction to these items means more money to the industry and some customers could send into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It’s no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like plates.
Even though my research found that the results of YouGov are correct, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, record stores and in online forums.
These people probably work hard in school or in offices.
They certainly won’t spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street record stores and leafing through records while avoiding the ghastly look of an enigmatic, 30-year-old fake moderator who’s no good over the shoulders of middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - Videobericht
Scientists say Greenland sharks have the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates sharks, says the record was for a woman who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer on demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to tear down 72 temporary stores in which people inside the warehouse goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, offer hairdressing services, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) per meal.
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also pointed out that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the deportation of people running the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of Calais prefecture were "absolutely comprehensible."
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people who “live in extremely precarious conditions.”
He said the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the downfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is run non-profit and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said that the closure "would be a disaster for these children, of which the youngest eight years are old."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of those living in the jungle camp had increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals over the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment, Martin remains a fighter
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic time trial, cycling pro Tony Martin does not want to get caught.
“I keep my eyes on the World Cup, stay confident and keep fighting,” the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He doesn’t have an explanation for his miserable 12th place at the sugar hut.
“To be honest, it’s hard for me to comment on yesterday’s time trial,” Martin said.
He had to calmly analyze the reasons that led to the debacle.
At the World Cup in October in Qatar, Martin wanted to compete for the title.
“I’m going to look at everything exactly what we’ve changed in the past.”
“This also includes my position,” wrote the three-time world champion, who had lost more than three minutes to Olympian winner Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday at 54.5 km.
Olympia: Tennis pro wins and misses semi-final
Laura Siegemund's win ended in the quarter-finals of Rio: The World Rankings-32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was only able to perform his kick once and acted powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, medal hopeful Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
Tommy Haas was the last German tennis professional to win a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of the Summer Games had last played in 1992.
Never before was a German duo in an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group steps up in start-up for live video game transmissions
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - Microsoft wants to benefit from it too.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money is flowing for the takeover, Microsoft did not share on Thursday.
Beam started its offering only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions and confront enemies as well as provide equipment items.
Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is going to help.
The advertising industry is already watching out.
Employees of the start-up, which is currently based in Seattle, Washington, are moving to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, according to Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi.
Therefore, nothing should change for the customers by taking over.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The live streaming market of video gaming activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is a member of Google’s mother Alphabet.
This is the Enforcement Trailer.
Germany’s racer must adjust to the next generation of speedometers: in various federal states, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are intended to transmit tempo particularly effectively.
The futuristic-looking Enforcement Trailer by Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges to be repaired with temporary tempolimit there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary lightning for compliance with the speed limit.
However, a permanent mobile setup can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-contained: its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement operation, and the case data is encrypted via a modem.
In addition, laser measuring technology allows all vehicles to be detected at the same time over several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as travel bans by time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In high-speed mode, you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling.
In order not to be easily stolen, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so that the wheels in the armored and by the way also bulletproof outer shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the flash from vandalism.
The trailer has been tested since 2015 according to Vitronic in various states and is now also being used.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: France recently ordered 100 pieces, following an order of 150 pieces last year.
UK Gets Silver in 7th Rugby After Fiji Gets Masterclass Gold
Britain’s impressive performance at the 7th Rugby World Cup came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fiji when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, trailing, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not-too-bad price of the silver medal – Britain’s fourth on that day – and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the boxers, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in this form in the best possible way.
It could be a comfort for GB – but it probably won’t – that at least one British will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind them.
Eight years ago, they lost every game to the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
Here they lost only one.
This slack will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks of GBs kick off with fun.
It felt like Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. were running in the buses, and the World Series winners went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau tied in the corner.
With another four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's superb tackle stopped Mann Leone Nakarawa's mountain to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the rebound and there was still over a minute of play... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravou pushed through further weak tackles of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It’s as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes in the half-time and closed the Fijian gap...for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova passed after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went on for a long time in favor of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, flags swirled and danced on the podium.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji’s playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the i-tupfelchen with another try in the last seconds.
The pfiff sounded, the Fijis embraced each other and GB kicked devastatingly beaten in the grasses.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan in the semi-finals by 20-5, and the United Kingdom pushed South Africa out of the race in a close semi-final match - Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the coach's cancer for rowing victory
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that means something.
From the first raid to the last, 220 hard hives that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the two who sat on the rudder, there were three voices in the boat. Coach Robin Williams’ echo was absent when they rode to the second Olympiagold in succession in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a standard.
Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39th unsuccessful bet, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph as a whole.
Behind every gold in the wheel is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference, and there was no one more helpful than the coach who didn’t know if he would survive that day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don’t, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to be able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside of the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is at all the right term under such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an encouragement.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station – 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediate vicinity of the victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking about it a little more than anything else and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was head of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week. That's maybe something extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a huge thank you goes to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have wished for a better coach or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm that their opponents could not keep up with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen shouted, “Stay in the process, stay in the process.”
It’s really important not to get caught up.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not going to do anything great.
We didn’t want a fireworks show today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a year off before making decisions about their future.
Glover is due to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I am an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new to me and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better," she said.
31 years as an example of clarity
The Managing Director of the Water Purpose Association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert G<0xC3><0xB6>ller, retires.
The association is considered to be "widely exemplary" in Bavaria.
A small Frankish drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
It was called in the original tone a while ago in a contribution by the Bavarian Radio.
A short time later, the Water Forum of the government of Unterfranken honored the Association of Purposes.
The work of the Veitenstein Group is considered "widely exemplary" in Bavaria.
Rupert G<0xC3><0xB6>ller, a 31-year-old employee of the Association for Purposes, has served as Managing Director for 28 years.
He was retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, annually promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 places and villages with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
Water supply contracts are available for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn’s mayor Gertrud B<0xC3><0xBC>hl (FW), recalled that Rupert G<0xC3><0xB6>ller was appointed as a water guard in 1985 and was appointed as Managing Director of the Association of Purposes in 1988.
“His tasks have been very diverse and they ranged from water management and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budgeting, calculating fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends,” said the chairman.
As outstanding events, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water lines.
There has been no stopping and you have always taken on new things because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised G<0xC3><0xB6>ller’s faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has dedicated himself with a lot of heart to his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the concept of success of the Veitensteingruppe for nitrate immersion in front of the water forum of the district of Unterfranken.
For this he has received a lot of recognition and praise.
Rupert G<0xC3><0xB6>ller, for his part, praised water guard Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best water guard and he was a faithful button.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
Highlights from his point of view, he described the well construction and the restructuring of the association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, were the pipe break at Kirchlauter’s high tank on January 3.
Here they had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the high tank of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the Drinking Water Association was handed over to Daniel St<0xC3><0xBC>rmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert G<0xC3><0xB6>ller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was diagnosed with her son, she believed she had to die.
The eight-year-old Tiago, however, has made good progress and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
“To give an example: if I ask him something that’s two years behind when I sang at Milan’s Scala, he doesn’t remember anything,” Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection to the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship status in Bargteheide - Man shoots at life partner
A 35-year-old man shot and killed his partner in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) on Friday at about 10.45 a.m.
"The man himself called us and stated that he had shot his life partner," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the run and will be publicly executed.
Meanwhile nationwide, because Sven S. could be traveling by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brown-burnt and has a flat.
Meanwhile, police have released a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man is wearing a glaze.
The man is not to be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, police said.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call the 110.
Police are talking about a "relationship state".
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The police in charge in L<0xC3><0xBC>beck did not initially want to make any information about the tathering or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim; however, they confirmed that a person had been killed.
"This is a murder crime."
"We're not saying much at the moment," said a police spokeswoman in L<0xC3><0xBC>beck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was on the scene.
Steel - Light View for German Steel Industry
The crisis-prone and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared millions of additional costs.
The financial burdens that threatened the industry from promoting eco-power are from the table.
It remains in the release of the renewable energy conversion at the existing facilities for the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutschen Allgemeinen Zeitung" (WAZ, free edition).
“I’m really happy that we were finally able to achieve that after two years of tough negotiations.”
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to cash in on the use of gas from the furnace for power generation for their own consumption.
The steel industry, according to the German industry association, threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ there is now a principled agreement with the EU Commission after talks with competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills will an EEG conversion of 20 percent occur.
But these will not be picked up in the steel industry either.
IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the EU Commission on own electricity generation.
Thus, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely defined.
Gabriel’s successful efforts for the steel industry are of particular importance.
"In terms of our 'Steel is the future' campaign, this is a first step."
“Others have to follow.”
“In the reform of emissions trading, climate and employment targets are also to be considered,” said IG Metal CEO J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure.
Last year, the situation continued to worsen as the world’s largest producer country, China, threw massive steel on the world market in the face of declining domestic demand.
European manufacturers impose price dumping on Chinese steel companies.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand, the imposed import duties on import steel have had an effect, and on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry-primous Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
In the end, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry is reacting to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to rule out closures of individual works.
Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced well six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, as the Steel Economic Association reported on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the amount produced now went back and forth for the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has fallen by two percent below the previous year’s value.
In the coming months, thanks to an improved order situation, the association expects an increase in emissions.
Community, Mind, Health: Singing is good for seniors
The singing has already accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: as a young girl, she was in school choir, in the teacher’s studio she covered the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a test, she feels balanced, happy, and overall more alive, she says.
By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describes Hackler.
Through regular interaction, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp has also made this experience in her choir: "To agree and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of coexistence".
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, Hackler says.
This is because seniors exercise a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly ask for their lungs do not get out of breath as quickly in everyday life.
Even when it comes to keeping the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Working Group of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher importance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people evokes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia find themselves at long-standing events.
When singing, the head is also asked for a special performance, explains Lenz.
Focusing on one’s own voice and on a predetermined rhythm while adapting to the other singers – this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone, practice in such a way that they don’t just focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences by singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The sense of self-worth also grows by singing in the choir.
To show myself: if I practice for a long time for something, I get better and grow beyond myself – this experience strengthens.
There are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
Those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate – even if they think they have little talent, advises Lenz.
You don’t sing alone – with 50 singing people, who can hear you when you go by a tone?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintance sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the ch<0xC3><0xB6>re in the surrounding area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the church or church leader directly.
Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.
Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask family, friends or neighbors for help with Internet research.
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - this applies to any age.
Cats react more sensitively than cats to crying young animals
In Hanover, biologists have investigated the effect of calling kittens to adult animals.
To their surprise, the miauen also did not leave the males cold - however, they always stayed the same, unlike the females.
Female cats can recognize the level of excitement of cat babies at the miaune of the little ones.
They respond ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens in great distress, as scientists from the Veterinary University and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH) have found out.
Cats also respond to the calls of kittens – but always the same.
“Obviously, the acoustic differences between the mingling of less and strongly excited young animals for males are either not noticeable or not significant,” said biologist Wiebke Konerding from MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten screams differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult kittens and eight kittens from the MHH’s animal husbandry were observed.
They were played at first by little ones who were taken out of the box for three minutes and separated by mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, which were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All the women, even those who had not yet had their own offspring, reacted differently to the scream," Konerding said.
They turned faster to the speaker when this call of the very excited kitten played.
This ability may be born or develop with the maturity of the sex.
“One surprise was that the males reacted at all,” the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noises several times in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women responded more sensitively to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, reported the biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski takes on Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan S<0xC3><0xBC>kur is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, a warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan S<0xC3><0xBC>kur.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match will take place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the ore rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is indicated.
Even in the imposition of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July, the government insisted that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
However, this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah G<0xC3><0xBC>len, who is responsible for the coup attempt.
This does not stop even before football is played.
The state prosecutor’s office issued a warrant for the arrest of former striker Hakan S<0xC3><0xBC>kur.
Thus, the now living S<0xC3><0xBC>kur in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Suk<0xC3><0xBC>r is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah G<0xC3><0xBC>len, who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days is still valid until October, in fact this has almost no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly “democracy guards” in public places across the country declared Erdogan dead on Wednesday.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the workers' club Besiktas do not traditionally count among the friends of the president.
But what unites the great majority of Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
There even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
With the Cup winner "Gala", Lukas Podolski will be back in particular.
In the last season, Cologne proved its sporting value: with 17 goals and nine appearances in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as top scorer of his club.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1-0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" praised him: "He was the best in the place."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the pre-round K.o in the Champions League, the "Lions" also leave early in the Europa League.
In the Super League, it was only six.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
“We did it and that’s the most important thing,” Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the year of the game was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who made the 14th title with 26 season hits as Super League goaltender king.
This is also the reason why fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
Meanwhile, Gomez, who is under contract at AC Florence and has only been loaned to Besiktas, had announced after the coup attempt, because of the political situation in the country not to return after his EM leave.
“If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it,” club manager Fikret Orman told Kicker magazine.
However, the striker should be willing to give up about a third of his estimated annual salary of 7.5 million euros, Orman made clear: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence".
Despite Doping: These Athletes Still Have Medal Chances at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin has already been arrested twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa may not start in Rio.
Other transferred athletics senders can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals.
The topic of doping continues to determine the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Russian swimmer Yulia Jefimowa, who had complained about her right of start shortly before the games after a doping ban, was mercilessly whipped out and ripped out at her start (100 meters breast).
There was a squeaky scene: with a set smile, she was still proudly in the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it was determined that they were not going to get gold, the audience broke into a cheering storm.
However, there are still many other athletes who, despite the doping past, will start at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was arrested twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has run even faster than before, he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m pole/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit on a six-month ban in 2010 after she was shown taking the painkiller oxycodon.
She had severe toothache after an operation, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (discuss/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, 2013 world champion and European champion tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine from 2010 to 2016.
Perkovic disputed the substantial intake and was detained for six months.
The four biggest throws this year go to the account of the big gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, had tested positive in 2010 and was locked for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt said.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammer throw, Belarus): Hardly a single athlete was subsequently unknown to so many medals.
So Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after being diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to hand out Olympia silver in 2004 for steroid doping and the EM title in 2006 for testosterone abuse.
He received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games, also unknown, on the basis of a judgment of the International Court of Sport CAS.
With 80.04 m it is ranked second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km to go, China): The world record holder and gold favorite was tested positive only in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old World Champion was found to be taking a banned food supplement, the WADA World Anti-Doping Agency’s lockdown fell mildly and ran out as early as July 13.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schn<0xC3><0xB6>ll, Friday morning.
She suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave again.
She was planning her return trip at the beginning of September.
Whether further explosions on the island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens is unclear at first.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard, says Schn<0xC3><0xB6>ll.
In Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok, two bombs exploded in an exit quarter on Thursday evening.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two explosives went up again, another person was killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the early hours.
During the detonation near the popular beach Patong with tourists, a taxi driver was injured according to police.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the explosives went into the air in a flowerbed in front of the coastal police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast required several injured.
One assumes a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.
"The bombings carry the same handwriting," Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters early Friday.
"We believe this is a coordinated attack."
It’s too early to comment on possible motives – but it’s probably about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country during the attacks.
Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," a Bangkok spokesman said.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
The authorities had received secret information in recent days about upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed about the exact time and locations.
It is unclear which group is behind the attacks.
Police have instructed their officials across the country to strengthen security around key government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are always smaller bombings in Thailand, but they usually do not target tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace that has been used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim sections of the population are advised not to travel to these provinces.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This will have a great influence on the military in the years to come.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to establish chaos as the country moved towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military run, which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is holding itself back in favor of bringing the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to seize the years-long insurgency of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country.
More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict.
Nearly a year ago, 20 people were killed in a raid on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country’s recent history.
The right-wing "Identitarian movement" has come under the guise of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several state offices, the constitutional defenders in the Bund have also monitored the group.
“We see in the ‘Identitarian movement’ indications for efforts against the liberal democratic basic order,” said Hans-Georg Maa<0xC3><0x9F>en, head of constitutional protection at the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamatory in an extremist way.
That is why we are watching the movement now as well.
The “Identitarian Movement” is a grouping of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It is opposed to "multiculty madness", "uncontrolled mass migration" and the "loss of one's own identity through alienation".
Constitutional defenders in nine states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identifiers".
Maa<0xC3><0x9F>en said his authority had closely aligned itself with the state offices in the decision.
“Groups like the ‘Identitarian movement’ are trying to get their target group where it stands,” the head of the constitutional protection said.
In general, extremists try to address them in a juvenile language, often with poppy music.
Islamists did the same thing as right-wing extremists.
This is not a paid advertisement for your own business.
Propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable to this.
That's dangerous.
Recently, reports from several federal states about contacts of "identifiers" to AfD politicians had been given.
Maa<0xC3><0x9F>en said he has no knowledge of this.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - is changing its direction by certain people who are extremist and thus become extremist.
It is crucial, therefore, whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the marked increase in law-motivated crimes and attacks on asylum-seekers and refugee accommodation, Ma<0xC3><0xA4>n said he would not speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But in recent years, we have found that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler group.
It may well be that further right-wing terrorist groups or small groups are forming, which are planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German-wide or European-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups were formed at the regional level or on social networks.
Concerned, Maas expressed concern that many attacks on the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before.
That's the worry-ridden thing.
Many of the suspects involved in attacks on asylum-seekers were previously not known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or right-wing supporters.
“So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, which may have been politically indifferent or, for example, elected CDU, SPD or left-wing, which have then become radicalized by right-wing extremist sentiments.”
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros has become an Internet hit
The Olympics or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia was swimming so slowly that he was temporarily no longer visible in the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ended his lead with a 48-second drop and placed 59th out of 59 starters.
But it was rather his non-sporty figure who attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian received a special start right from the International Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make swimming known in under-represented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, they just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Hatte is getting ready for the big race.
The first top names quickly made the round.
Some media called him "the Robel of the Whale".
In response to a "well-being belly", the English boulevard sheet "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100-meter freestyle, did not matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani’s run garnered media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to take part in a course of over 100 meters of freestyle alone.
Frenetically, Moussambani was fired at the time.
The 22-year-old learned to swim just eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop on the New Square has been robbed.
According to police, the 67-year-old Geretsrider had left her business at about 5:30 p.m. on Monday and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning around 8:15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the box.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump Doesn't See the Threat of Electoral Determination That Close
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is speaking at an election campaign event in Florida.
If there is nothing to do with the election of the U.S. president, Donald Trump already has an alternative video.
He just went on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential election in November, he doesn’t care: “Ultimately it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation,” the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with U.S. television channel CNBC.
If it’s not rich for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s okay, Trump said.
He called U.S. President Barack Obama and the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, the founder of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
At last, more and more resistance was formed within his party.
Post Rises in Trade with Electric Transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the ride is obviously great.
The Post also plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter.
Soon, the Group will start trading with the carrier.
The Post will also offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
"We want to go on sale to third parties," a postman said on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are to be delivered to other companies.
Post-CEO J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Gerdes had said there are always demand, for example from artisans.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonner Group will soon enter mass production of the vehicles.
In post-production, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long term spur a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles.
“We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020,” he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we are relocating the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on German roads since 2014.
GfK management follows disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK replaces its chief Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly – but not quite surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK pointed out that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann will be all the more insecure, the longer the successes promised by him will remain.
Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the global number five of the industry is facing a personal new beginning.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, has already resigned from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management of the board will take over the former board member Gerhard Hausruckinger as early as September 1, the company said.
He is to officially assume the role of a "professor" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
Details did not want to name a company spokesman on Friday.
Whoever will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
In investor circles, it was said on Friday that the last time the shareholders were disappointed about the continued success of the restructuring launched years ago was a big one.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK peak since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible after 5 years," it said.
Given the latest poor GfK business numbers, every shareholder will at some point become restless.
“If that were the case with BMW, so would the Quandts,” he said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the previous quarter.
At <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
Compared to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent with 721.2 million euros.
Profits in the second quarter were particularly affected by the company’s decline in value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company’s <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>139 million value write-offs, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business sector, resulted in a loss of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>148.2 million to the Group.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had generated a further Group profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus crashes in Krummh<0xC3><0xB6>rn in Graben: Eight injured
In the case of an accident of a bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummh<0xC3><0xB6>rn (Aurich County).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid a counter-traffic truck, according to her information.
The bus came to the right of the road and slipped into a ditch, as a police spokeswoman Aurich/Wittmund reported.
“Due to the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus independently,” she said.
The fire department freed the occupants.
Six ambulances and an ambulance arrived at the crash site on Landesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 2.
The uninjured passengers were taken by a bus back to the Krummh<0xC3><0xB6>rn district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company.
The investigators asked the trucker and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of wastewater from 1 October 2016 are 3.44 euros instead of 2.10 euros for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl wastewater treatment plant; 3.36 euros for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp (previously 2.26 euros) and 3.64 euros for Azendorf (previously 2.18 euros).
In the case of the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will increase at the latest, if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.
After an excessive calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinh<0xC3><0xA4>user (CSU) reported, when approving the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach, it was found that for these wastewater treatment plants there are roofs.
The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of legal bases, to operate the plants cost-covering.
From 1 October 2016, citizens, as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to get deeper into the wallet.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed to the board, a recalculation of the fees for the waste water systems of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercovers from the previous calculation period should also be balanced.
The serious increase in fees, Schmidt argued, was that all three wastewater treatment plants are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
Thus, due to the low distribution base, for example, costs for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the amount of wastewater in all three plants is slightly decreasing.
In addition, in the remaining calculation period, in all three plants, due to their age, renovation and repair costs have occurred to a considerable extent.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the waste water plant Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.
In the pump plant Welschenkahl, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be dismantled, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility can also be installed to meet the water regulations.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses included the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which should be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinh<0xC3><0xA4>user made it clear that in the case of the low waste water attack in the three plants, the costs for operation and maintenance are "full-blown".
In doing so, Schmidt added, the market community of large entertainment costs at the wastewater treatment plants have remained spared over the past 20 years.
The situation for these facilities will continue to be precarious in the view of stone houses for the long term, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water treatment plant cannot be expanded around these facilities because they are deficit facilities.
Bulgaria bookings inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were booked.
The annual average inflation over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to the CPI -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routines (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained the same as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; as well as education unchanged.
Snapchat's 'Anime' Effect Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that already limits absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unbleached, feature twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All the mistakes go to the public.
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, in which they were accused that the app would promote blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it proposed to some users this week a filter that gave them sloth eyes, false teeth and swollen cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "Yellow Face".
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded them of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely circulated over the photos, wrote that the filter was "injurious and, to put it mildly, unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very hostile Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been drawn into the devaluing extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stumbling blocks.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people — who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counterparts — might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat’s filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, “it’s much harder for such things to remain unnoticed than it used to be,” 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the largely white, male-only leadership and ended her post with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“Either they don’t have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions,” said the Chinese-American Zhu, “or they have people with other skin colors working there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable there.”
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a human resources manager who focuses on underrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said she would close her Snapchat account and added, “I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K..”
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, sets congressional committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed news service information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground, a Congressional investigation committee reported on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts, who reported how the commanders assessed their American efforts in the fight against the Islamists.
The Central Command, short for Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Message intelligence, which was typically hijacked by top-level Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of U.S. efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed for actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis of other news services.”
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The management errors in Centcom go all the way to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their predecessors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements, and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than it corresponds to the facts,” the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military recapture of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, that's all clear," said Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressional member from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Central Command’s top officials changed the intelligence reports to lower the risk posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force to life after being told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports about the Islamic State.
The report, which was published on Thursday, will be complemented by more detailed findings as investigations continue.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense are underway.
Democratic members of the News Service Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
“In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an over-restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services,” said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democrat on the committee.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of news service reports", damaged morale among analysts and "gave too little room for dissenting opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had found no evidence of a White House intervention among Centcom analysts regarding a “certain political opinion.”
The preliminary results of the congressional investigations were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon’s inspector general, who were taken in after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on reports from Congress while the Inspector General’s investigations are still underway.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense."
The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful U.S.-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the defense ministry).
Last year’s accusations, however, raised the question of whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of controversies from more than a decade ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece of writing about how the then-government under George W. Bush, despite the recommendations of many analysts, only a small amount of time went by during the pre-occupation period.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government officials, found that, contrary to the government’s statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group’s financial situation, as these provisional refineries had taken up the operation of the oil refineries.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The U.S. wins fourth game in women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain ahead
One day after shooting three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a game on Thursday against India that the American women won 3-0.
Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn’t remember ever doing that.
"I don't know," she said.
I’m not one of those people who keeps their doors in mind.
However, she knows that the American women are 4-0 in the Olympic Games and are equal in their group with the British in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will win first and second place respectively.
The first-place finisher will take the strong Dutch women a little longer out of the way that leads the other group.
However the game may come out on Saturday, the American women have triggered a surprising swirl through their success story, four years after landing at the last London Games in the last of 12 places.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time at age three had a hockey bat in her hands (their two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became a U.S. national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she was unable to qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the coach of the national team and thus began to turn things around for the better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the working pension in London that we have now.
We were able to completely pull the rudder around.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a knock-back from the nearby area.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team showed surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and kicked the ball into the goal to give the American women a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the U.S. goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a goal in each of the previous games so far.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a rushing race between competition and striving.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff, which is reached from the armchair to the swimmer to the triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and a swarm of women with thorns, could have been among those familiar names sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he were a swimmer, Turner or even a wrestler.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold at the Olympic Trampoline Tournament.
The Olympic flame does not light up every event.
Further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breaststroke and may prevail for a long time.
But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been perceived so sparsely in the last 16 years that many of the people I interviewed didn’t know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jump and by 2012 had an athlete who managed it until the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medal this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain outer charm, in part because it sounds more appropriate for the unlit ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential – the cardboard-like shivering of its never-ending impact – but also the grace of turning and diving, the two sports that it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "jumpboard."
Ascending winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet into the air and need a series of falling movements (rotations, fences and saltos) before landing on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympia program according to performance, degree of difficulty and "flight time".
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopefuls must go further in their quest for gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the pitch.
They are not only chasing the finish line or the starting wall, but also in television broadcasting another lofty goal: that of the world or of the Olympic record.
The goal-oriented pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical – and it’s enough to even stir a viewer to tears.
But it’s also what I find a bit tiresome when watching these games myself.
The trampoline offers a pause in breathing.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is at the top.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she crashes, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games.
The women’s qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men’s on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days starting at 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympia mania, they promise a calm, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general turmoil.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the assertion and objectification of male athletes – as the male U.S. tourners recently suggested according to The Wall Street Journal – then Mr. Dooley is expecting his air-calling, new fan community.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia were met with violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with police in the event of gunfire.
Is Ethiopia just about to collapse?
In the last ten years it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was merciless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters in the area.
Videos circulating about the protests, which are likely from last year or early this year, show how security forces hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is estimated by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence agencies are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia, and few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy – human rights organizations have continuously led government repression – the opposition in the country has been restrained, effectively silenced by dissidents.
Many were sent to exile or jail, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.
But that could change.
“If you oppress people and they have no other options but to protest, it breaks out,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Asia.
All the youth protested.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the use of soil to the use of fertilizers in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this delicate, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less coerced in recent years, could exploit turbulence and re-arm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding under the surface after years of pre-cooking.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does on a regular basis, especially in the event of protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians reported that they had gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Aeons, the Amharas, who come from mostly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, have thrived in politics and business, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But that is also changing right now.
“We are coordinating under one umbrella,” said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up about 6% of the population and who are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years until his death from an unpublicized disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say he was particularly keen on detecting early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to deal with opponents and make them harmless.
“The current regime lacks this basic skill,” said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested elections that, according to analysts, were seemingly rigged by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the ensuing raids many protesters were killed, even though there were fewer than in the last few months and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the Ethiopian government’s internal disfavor.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked shops run by Tigray in Gondar, an Amharic city, and hatred towards Tigray is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the protests bring the U.S. and other Western allies into a peculiar position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin walk in the garden."
Donald Trump says Obama’s claim that ISIS was founded was “Sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the “founders” of the Islamic State terror group was not meant to be serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also brings his opponents, who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant at all.
After making the announcement at an election campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump backtracked on the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early-morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation was completely serious.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn’t want to know anything about it.
The latest storm of criticism looms over Mr. Trump as he tries to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling polls on the economic situation.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held talks on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump once again tried to return to the subject.
On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he thought the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later explained "Of course I meant it sarcastic".
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to redraw back as needed.
“I think it’s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, ‘clarify’ depending on how the reaction goes,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who watches the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of detracting from the tone of the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more audacious tone as his poll scores have continued to decline.
A new poll by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, released Friday, showed a high-stakes lead in the U.S. state of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to have to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly in the spotlight in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s jokes have brought his loyal contenders into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York and one of Trump’s most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
“I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments,” Mr. Giuliani said, so he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trump’s statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them "backbenchers", completely wrong and that's why it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by letting it aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding on each of his words and being biased against him.
He scorned the “poor, miserable” television experts who were trying to understand him and said, “You can’t!”
Some of the Democrats ridiculed Mr. Trump’s apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
Once pushed over the price of the market, cafe in Greenpoint comes back
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg where you could only pay for a bar that didn’t have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue storefront.
The Soap Cherie store, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals blamed it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded, and Verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is a change, then it is also a reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide money for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, did a lot of work.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural travel bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, for this there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
“Many old customers have also been displaced by prices from Williamsburg,” he said.
Recently, on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would take the path on her own.
After the verb had closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
“I realized that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked,” she said.
Now she’s drinking coffee again, even though she ordered a blended chai tea instead of her usual iced coffee that day, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been a long-time and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
“I came quarter to seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything bagel with butter,” he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he replaces his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he was not joking about the soap business taking over the old business space.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verbs with the cold brewed coffee of the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we're going to look at her offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to exhibit it soon, making his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill the cold brewed coffee in the bottle and sell it.
There is a chance that the café will expand into a neighbouring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the venue and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
“I had to smell it,” he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a weakness for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies such as P<0xC3><0xA2>te de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and as a dessert a plum pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, “It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat.”
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the U.S., while Ziegelman tells about life in a house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective in her book "97 Orchard".
Her latest collaboration, "A Decent Meal", which will appear on Tuesday in Harper's publishing house, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snub-free snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash of 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered hackbraten, this found the pair suitable for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were made from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinners.
Coe grins.
“It must have been in the stomach like lead,” he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastries were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country dealt with being no longer the Schlaraffenland.
“It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans,” said Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Just as excited was the new budget diet: mysterious foods such as bread and cashews became staples, which cashews as a "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers," Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the focus of American cuisine for years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Unique blends were tried, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
“It wasn’t a popular addition to lunch,” says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
As never before or since, household economists—including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943—driven the country’s eating habits in such a way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “household politicians” and to meet the challenge of turning Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical treats.
In particular, the reports on the government’s response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers’ lass-mich-kuchen-essen-keeping, are tasty.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he ate like the million-pound man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a smoking gun.
He was wonderfully realistic.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt resulted in the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most heartlessly prepared.
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, dealing with food, were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as on how science has been applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple agreed to better understand the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother-in-law – for example, how she could not throw away food.
“She had a real fear of the waste of food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert President Roosevelt had eaten at noon.
"It's called Prune Whip," Ziegelman said, adding that it was a common trick to miss out on modest recipes a fancy name.
There was no beaten cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each of them accidentally dipped a spoon into the tough, brown glimmers.
Unsurprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe received a recommendation three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life on the line to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that has so far saved the lives of nearly 60,000 people, according to Bild newspaper.
2,900 volunteers are putting their own lives at risk to pull people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil guard showing him in an 11-hour rescue of a baby from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, as pictured: “For me, this is the real jihad.”
"When I die to save life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffering from respiratory distress.
“We are now eliminating the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don’t play with it,” the picture quoted his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
A rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation aboard the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland sharks are only born at the age of 150.
The Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean in an hour, reaching an average of just 1,220 meters.
Only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a speed of 2.6 km/h - and at this maximum speed is half as fast as a robbe.
However, this lifestyle, characterised by slowness, seems to be a patent concept for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least of a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Insanity", Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span, which is a world record for vertebrates.
The evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks will be rocked.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the Eismeer off the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers do not know much about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their time-lapse pace when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
Yet these sharks are still preying on: In the stomach of one animal, researchers found the remains of a robbe, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol the bottom of the iceberg and look for cadavers that dry from higher layers of water down.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks that caught fishermen from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest one measured 502 centimeters.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens cores of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is created already before the birth of the shark, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons experiments dragged larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In contrast, in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimetres, the lens core contained a small excess of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons tests, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its 2012 study.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had in their lens core normal amounts of carbon-14, which is caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 watch for a 493-centimetre-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres is believed to be even 392 years old.
It was well known that Greenlandic females only get young when they are more than four meters long.
Now researchers of length were able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood on the threshold of sexual maturity and was determined to be 156 years old, Greenland sharks are obviously allowed to reproduce for at least one and a half centuries.
This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates at the moment.
The fact that such methuses live primarily in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale with a 120-year-old harpoon tip on his neck, was also caught outside Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often also runs on sparse flames.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals also often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal absorbs heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
“A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible,” explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Construction ground in double pack
In the recent meeting, the municipal council focused on building issues.
With relief, the committee took note of Mayor Robert Putz's announcement that "the marketing of the newly designated residential areas can finally begin".
After the land, parcelling and opening questions have been clarified and requests for measurement have been made, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Stra<0xC3><0x9F>lweg" and "Sch<0xC3><0xB6>nau-West" (Binderstra<0xC3><0x9F>e area - Extension section 1) to interested parties is no longer a problem.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Sch<0xC3><0xB6>nau are equally appealing to young families and restful seniors.
As it was said, construction volunteers can immediately report to the Town Hall, and the Municipal Council is expected to consult on the allocation of parcels at its September meeting.
In order to also be able to comply with requests for the settlement of further commercial establishments associated with the creation of jobs, the Municipal Council decided to amend the land use plan, which was only newly created in the spring of this year, in sub-areas.
Thus, in the area of the sub-station, the commercial area already designated there is expanded by two parcels towards Staatsstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city on the Main therefore has the best chances to attract jobs and companies relocated from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
“It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote,” says Michael Voigtl<0xC3><0xA4>nder, head of the IW’s financial and real estate markets competence field.
According to the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money-houses can operate further from London out of financial transactions across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, it is sufficient for them to be admitted to the UK.
This is being used by large U.S. banks.
Several banks have already announced that they are moving jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which brings together the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority (EIOPA) and the ESRB Risk Board.
While the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is headquartered in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
“The proximity to the note bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervisor,” says IW-Professor Voigtl<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, but as with Dublin, its infrastructure was poorer.
Thanks to the large airport, Frankfurt is much easier to reach.
Also points the city with easily available commercial properties.
“In Paris, it’s not so easy to find free high-quality offices,” says Voigtl<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
At the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than at the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer’s corporate consultancy, the city is ranked seventh, Luxembourg ranked 19, Dublin ranked 33rd, and Paris ranked 37th.
Even if quality of life is a matter of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW says.
But London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Brexit vote, according to the economic researchers.
For this reason, the strength ratios also speak: in London, according to figures from the Helaba Landesbank at the end of 2015, around 144000 people worked in the banking industry, in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. Attorney ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by it in the Hepatitis C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was freed from a $200 million damages compensation for Merck’s violation of two patents related to Gilead’s blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge sampled Merck’s misconduct, including a mercenary, a handmaid, and others.
On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to pay the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to equalise with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and took ownership of laboratory work, which is based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs.
U.S.-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
U.S.-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters in the city left them, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are currently combing through the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters buried inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the DKS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
“The city is now under complete control, but we are currently doing clean-up work,” he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, giving the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband an income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in redundancies; the former Secretary of State gave $3 million in income from the Simon & Schuster publishing house for her book on her tenure.
Clinton’s presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, published his tax returns for the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In sharp contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and pullbacks in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited a tax review by tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
“They’re on the move,” Clinton’s campaigning assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the release of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits are completed.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it plausible that his refusal raises questions about assets, his donations to charities, his business interests, and various other connections, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already stumbled upon the topic and released a video on the Internet on Friday in which top Republican Trump is calling for his tax return to be published.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the past decades and to publish his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico reported that during the 1990s, Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years, and a New York Times economic journalist cited a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors on Friday stating that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people who earn more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama supports the proposal as well.
During an election campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called on Trump to exchange a meeting on their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to an IRS tax review and Trump had “fear” of voters and not the tax authorities.
Clinton’s campaign has published tax returns retroactively until 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons’ 2015 tax return showed that they considered only $100 of their income as wages, unlike the majority of all Americans.
Their main monetary base was a cost-effective index fund, from which the Clintons taxed dividends and revenues of USD 109,000.

Condoms with chili powder, firework bodies promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Naturalists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to keep elephants from going to human-inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chili powder.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea to do so years ago, has stepped up its support along with U.S. nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-stage method to protect their homes and harvest without using ink.
Previously, many spears were used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
“Since we developed the ... Toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, making them much more confident that they can keep elephants off their fields without harming elephants,” said Damian Bell, managing director of Honeyguide.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chilivolke" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a firework body into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition wire.
When it is lit, the condom pops up with a bang and sprays fine dust of chili powder into the air.
A touch is usually already out to chase the elephant.
One last possibility is a thrower, which shoots a gold rain fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No kiosk building at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, St. Goarer’s investment projects are adopted by businessmen with a kiss – but it is precisely the retail sector in the core city that is clearly expandable.
However, the City Council now unanimously rejected the request for the construction of a new sales kiosk on the Rhine River near the Rhine balcony under construction.
“Basically, we welcome new business people, but at this location in an exposed location on the Rhine River, this kiosk does not fit,” said Michael Hubrath for the CDU group.
Jewish director cancels Berlin hotel because Israeli pre-election was removed after "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media frenzy after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli preference because it had "requested" Arab guests, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", expressed his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and erased?
written by Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel via its own call center.
After searching for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The response he received there “shocked him,” as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was a "intended decision of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it caused even more anger in the director.
“The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-selection be deleted,” Lanzmann’s employee was quoted as saying.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the South German newspaper.
We were appalled and appalled by this event.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has contributed to exactly this hotel chain in Germany is even a bigger shame.
This does not require an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered a rather large Internet response, in which people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some suggested to the Kempinski Hotel that it had "rejected" the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Shame on you," it said in another post, pointing out that the hotel, located on the noble Kurf<0xC3><0xBC>rstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly showed all the charges against itself and called the incident a "sad" and "apologies" at Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction to not include Israel in the list of quick elections," the South German newspaper quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel as saying.
It adds that the country selection has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest the government’s reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, which led to the police using rubber floors and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay over the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, slightly less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen graffiti against the Provisional President Michel Temer spraying on the walls.
The latest protests came a few days after protesters took to the streets to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country has grown strongly, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are taking on existing ties with Iran, while new companies are willing to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade boom was achieved through deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
This year, Dzhagaryan is counting on a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, the Russian foreign ministry issued around 35,000 visas, primarily visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year are broken,” he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses Wanted: Drink Market Attacked in Waldbr<0xC3><0xB6>l
A robbery took place on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL at Waldbr<0xC3><0xB6>ler Gerberstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
Subject to a gun, three dark-clad people, who had been hiding their faces, demanded from the employee of the beverage market the release of cash and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver VW golf.
How much money has been borrowed, the police do not share.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, so they are relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible and poorly visible from the parking deck of the Rewe market.
After the attack, the attackers must run towards Gerberstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and flee from the gravel parking lot in front of the parking lot entrance with the silver-colored car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time of the incident (at 7:45 p.m.) related to the robbery should report to the police urgently.
Nagold: Play and fun at summer leisure
Eight beautiful and happy days were spent by the children and young people of the social-pedagogical day group/social group work of the Nagold Children’s Protection Federation with their caregivers during their summer vacation in Nussdorf, near M<0xC3><0xBC>hlacker.
In the quiet Freizeitheim Hardtw<0xC3><0xA4>ldle, the lively group was quartered during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
For one thing, it went to Bretten with the visit of the Strichelzoos.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special child guidance in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts.
During the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep lake in Maulbronn, which invites you to jump, swim and board.
Culinaryly, children and carers were spoilt with their own prepared body foods such as the Saure Sp<0xC3><0xA4>tzle, the Seebronner Pf<0xC3><0xA4>nnle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and T<0xC3><0xBC>binger Bolognanese.
In workshops were baptized, beautiful jewelry made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Bright Evening".
On the day of the trip home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna Soul Care Unit were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were managed together.
In order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all ministers in two years’ time, the St. Anna High Council of Ministers has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided to visit the Bishop’s Town of Freiburg, where, this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the Gate of Mercy at Freiburger M<0xC3><0xBC>nster.
16 minis made of bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Holy Rooms made their way.
On the evening before, the parish priest Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim's cross and granted the pilgrim's blessing.
From Horb the train was taken to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a M<0xC3><0xBC>nster Our Beloved Woman and thus the pilgrimage route was approached by the M<0xC3><0xBC>nster.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and lyrics.
But also on the way, the minis stopped at field crosses, chapels or churches again and again to sing together a song from a specially composed pilgrim songbook.
The parish houses of the local parishes were available for the overnight stays.
Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller made sure to have a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went to G<0xC3><0xBC>tenbach via Furtwangen.
Days later, the stage was moved to St. Peter, which was the most difficult route, but at the time of the cold heat, they had to climb about 500 meters and then climb again.
The reward earned in the evening was a shared barbecue at the Badweiher.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Visiblely relieved and happy, the minis met later in the afternoon at the Freiburger M<0xC3><0xBC>nster and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a little encouragement, God was here.
In the evening fair in the M<0xC3><0xBC>nster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by Cooperator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon it was back to Horb by train.
In the end, all the participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scott Callum Skinner storms home as Brite earns gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner retired last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the role of anchor, which his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself his own. The boy-spund made the legend proud when he stormed home to take home a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place at the London World Rail Championships in March despite Hoys' resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in a timely manner as Hinds appeared.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the scotch that has now developed.
Hindes, Kenny – who won with Hoy four years ago – and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was barely back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation, with Hinde driving in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy looked out of his position as a BBC expert and fell to Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes as they climbed onto the podium.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph with Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start, he deliberately fell onto the track.
He later retracted this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an overwhelming victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like all the GB flags on the stands like London."
We have been together as a team for the past three months.
We’ve gotten away so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win the Olympics again.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which has won seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If that’s a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrome.
With Kenny’s form, it is possible that he repeats Hoys’ victory of three Olympic gold medals in one competition.
That would mean for Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly sacred date for British sports; that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) – a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
It's the same as Hoy's.
Kenny is next to take part in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I’m just enjoying this for the moment.”
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They arrived at the target in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won in 2012 in London Gold, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be in the spotlight.
He had quarreled with officials before qualifying yesterday, when officials called him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women’s competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and collect a bunch of medals.
After a truly extraordinary portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were lowered.
Dramas took place in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first night of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks as if the now legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of Portland's meltdown due to termination of the energy contract
The future of Portland’s Victoria aluminum meltdown – as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs – is at stake as the plant operator cancels the energy supply contract and will therefore terminate all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the government’s decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to operate the facility.
A subsidy set for 20 years will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs at the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2,000 jobs – direct and indirect – could be at risk of closure.
In addition, domino effects could occur as the meltdown consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total power generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Melting Plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesea Power Plant last year.
Alcoa’s Portland melting pot is losing money and risking closure.
This step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it is expected that three more owners will cancel their contracts.
The facility is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue operating, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting process," the company said in a statement.
AGL continued to say that the contracts are so-called "security deals" that should have entered into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects that the contracts will contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," the electricity supplier said.
All potential impacts on revenues on AGL as of GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written off the value of the contracts in its $187 million annual contract in "expectation of termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts does not affect the "ability of Alcoas to operate the melting or ensure the power supply to the melting".
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which is expected to enter into force from November this year, even though it still owes an explanation as to why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn due to the bad economic conditions of the industry of the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
Referring to the statements of analysts earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consumes around 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
Should both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a significant decrease in demand on the [power market].
And that would not be good for us as a generator," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador and ran on Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for Rob and Caitlyn's problems and in the presence of the most popular show-biz-on-the-shower), all of them with the most popular show-biz and pro-sie.
This is the clichéd action of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we forgot you?", with the honesty of a cartoon girl on a broadcast site at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to take her other girls somehow to this publicity.
With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall’s big sister Kim likes to beat her on the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is a league in itself.
The September issue is Vogue’s best-selling issue of the year.
With a scope that is more like an image strip than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista, from the 832 pages of the roller 615 pages of advertising).
The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years images of the magazine were leaked before the official announcement.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or teens of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if all of this applies to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner’s success doesn’t appeal to everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world has always been a bit tense.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the pieces of misery of the moment."
These feelings boiled down again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.
But riding around on the malaise seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
It is, in the truest sense of the word, a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She does advertising for your foundation by Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sold her pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their kids.
Community law centers attract 160,000 people every year
More than 160,000 of the country’s most in need are rejected annually by community law centres, while the industry is focused on the impact of further cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly elderly people, immigrants, workers in need, victims of violence, and those who have no means of unjust denunciation and the like — are already being refused free legal advice and legal assistance when applying for legal aid.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already overburdened, are ready for further reductions.
As of June next year, these centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Law Centers, said the latest survey by the National Association of Community Law Centers found that thousands of people are already being rejected each year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government’s decision.
“Queensland’s community law centers are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people will be turned away from the important services you need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with insurmountable and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unfairly fired – all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they can’t get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent, which means that thousands of more peace-loving people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and the Minister of Justice and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to lift these cuts immediately, so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their client communities, as well as the fact that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign accused after employee allegedly pulled a gun
NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump’s campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina had fired a gun at an employee in February while they were on a Jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in Charlotte County Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini stated that he had waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "drawn a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the run into Vincent's knees," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining to local and regional campaign leaders, Bordini found that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he said in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to do damage," Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the “Second Amendment people” – gun owners and gun friends – should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected.
Trump’s campaign made it clear that the media had removed his words from the context and that he would not encourage violence.
Bordini’s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of the duty of care and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent damage to the sea.
Trump’s spokesman, Hope Hicks, was unable to reach an opinion.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
He did not respond to calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
The proceedings are Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Poll before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
The upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) marked significant losses for the SPD and CDU government parties.
This was the result of representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "image" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could barely continue to govern, this is not possible according to the Berlin polls.
In both federal states, the SPD would be the strongest party and thus have a good chance of continuing to lead the government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to a survey, the party is still just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left came to 19 percent (before 18.4%), the AfD would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the country day.
The Greens, despite a slight loss of 6% (previously 8.7%), are returning to the Schweriner Landtag.
NPD and FDP would not be represented on the national day with 3 percent each.
In the Berlin parliamentary election, the SPD was only 23 percent (2011 election: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It is still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would represent 14 percent for the first time in the House of Representatives.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the entrance as opposed to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
Email and Internet in Time: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and larger, so it was not well in hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which today would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The Nokia 9000 Communicator was launched 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices online, but they somehow come from the stone age of the internet age.
Twenty years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hannover as an "office in the west pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for those standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator to be reached.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit painfully slow.
A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded up similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and settled.
The market today is dominated by providers, all of which came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere be online, this is today for a lot of people everyday.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices have been sold, of which 555 million are missing on Samsung and Apple alone.
The worldwide sales of the devices is around 400 billion euros.
To this end, the well-running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
Around the smartphone, an entire industry has emerged.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, all easy to use via touch screen.
Apple’s victory began, even today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola, and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had a reputation.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
That’s what Apple and Asian companies like Samsung have to say.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his phone 88 times a day.
“We all have to learn to put the smartphone away,” said Janina Kugel, who is in charge of the Siemens Staff Board.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England must lead the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring not only renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was Heathrow’s biggest attraction, just as we did back in 2012 in London when we made a big effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were before us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of extending Heathrow is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in scientific growth, and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 – which was chosen as the world’s best airport terminal for five years in a row, to the T2, built in the midst of the world’s two busiest runways.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It’s time for us to guide this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as secure our future trade and create an inheritance of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and Former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Cat and Mouse Game" about ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circumvent ad blocking, a “cat and mouse game” is the same.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block ads again on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding regarding its ads in order to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth battle between the ad-blocking open source community and the surrounding community is already underway since the invention of ad-blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, around 200 million people use ad blockers worldwide; nearly four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company has aimed at ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook’s mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large share of revenue, so Facebook seems to be investing such a step as worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its “Ad Preference Tool” to give people more control over targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"For users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blockers are a stupid tool, which is why we instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people’s hands.
Woman Crossing Swiss Highway in Suspect of Suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling for witnesses after a woman was allegedly killed by several vehicles on a highway in the early hours of Thursday morning.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay in the dark "in an act of desperation" on the street and were hit by several cars, police said in Waadt.
It is obvious that a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, police said, urging them and any witnesses to report the incident.
An investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something that the public prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In each of the two cases - in which a person was running in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers did not have to assume that a pedestrian was running on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of the negligent killing after she overrun and killed a man who was on the A1 one night in August 2014 near Payerne.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident near Morges on Thursday should contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-density atmosphere might have once given up Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that the Venus might have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.
The model also highlighted the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
“In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its daytime side to the sun for almost two months,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than those of Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus, similar to the evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists.
Although probably habitable at one time, Venus — over several billion years — was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained -- the Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
On Thursday, Patrick Roy retired as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche and led to a too low right of co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternate President/General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
“Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination,” said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
I’ve been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team over the course of the summer to give him more depth, that it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today about this decision," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season at the 2013–14 Avalanches, Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the league.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Minnesota's playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches scored a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, set off strike
The labor struggles regarding wages for North Sea oil workers will be put off, while all the parties in the dispute will sit down for a new round of talks, the negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute,” it said in a joint statement.
We will hold some full-day meetings in the coming weeks, which will begin early next year to address the problems again.
The unions said their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group reduced the rates of its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate cut follows a 10-percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts give the company the space it needs to get through the market boom.
Shell has fired thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that had been exacerbated by the UK’s decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have been going on for a generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few,” he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades star cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars rotate in the cluster at different rates, and in what context the rotational periods are related to the planet's formation.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters of stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The Pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, created about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They're turning faster now.
At peak rotation rates, these mature stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable starspot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars are rotating more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
“In the ‘ballet’ of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars,” Rebull said.
Because the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.
“The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older,” Rebull said.
There is still a lot in front of us about what we would like to know more about, such as how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang their "dance shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star is leaving.
The tears at Alex Rodriguez ran faster than the U.S. baseball star in the best days from base to base.
Following his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will wear his New York Yankees jersey for the last time against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12.
“I love this game and this team.”
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14-time All-Star Game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league three times, winning the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
His signature under a ten-year contract gave him $27 million annually since 2007.
By the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will serve as a consultant and youth coach – with full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid back a long time with performance.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994–2000), the Texas Rangers (2001–2004), and since 2005 the Yankees created a few milestones.
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old is not allowed to be admitted to the baseball hall.
Because so successful was Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
As early as 2009, the superstar admitted to having taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was suspended for 211 games due to a tie in the so-called biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is believed to have received performance-enhancing drugs for years via an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the ban was reduced to 162 meetings.
“The league could have done me a favor for 2014 because I played 20 years without a break,” Rodriguez said at the time.
Even his farewell days don’t go silent.
While many baseball legends in their last games once again got the big stage, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job does not include a farewell tour."
“My job involves trying to win every game,” said Yankees coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz, and the relationship with Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson is being told, received sympathies from fans of Yankee rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the supporters sang in the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are eclipsed by the first official doping cases.
An accomplished athlete would have won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases have become known at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter hurdle runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positive and ruled out in Brazil - just before the start of the critically acclaimed athletics competition.
The diuretic Hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances, had already been detected in Chen last Sunday.
On Friday afternoon, the International Court of Sport (ICC) confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had placed fourth in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen was expected to participate in the parades over 50 m freestyle.
Chen asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B-test and a hearing.
The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and requires full cooperation from Chen in the investigations," Xinhua said in a statement: "We will cooperate with the International Court of Sport CAS and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news of the positive test at Danekova passed, the 33-year-old himself went into the offensive.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she told Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She is innocent, “the only explanation could be dietary supplements,” the athlete explained.
According to the report, it is believed that the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa has been temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-probe is already positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.
“I don’t understand why athletes don’t draw the right conclusions,” he said, “We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded.”
For example, not all weightlifters from the chronically doping-laden nation are allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone three days earlier like his brother Tomasz.
Both contest the intake, however, both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the lightweight athletes, the Danekova case is especially a serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.
The IAAF World Federation had banned the entire Russian team until an exception due to systematic doping was made, and the Kenyan runner nation produced many bad news in Rio.
In swimming sports, the previous crimes in China had also caused violent clashes between the athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
"Sun that pink lilac."
“If I see the podium over 200 m of freestyle, I want to surrender,” Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the center of an argument with Australian Mack Horton.
“I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters,” he said.
Sun had tested positive for Trimetazidine in 2014 at the Chinese Championships, but only had to sit for a three-month ban.
Data breach: How perfide blackmails hackers their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies – and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists, malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once in the past 12 months, partly multiple victims of an attack with blackmailer software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of ransomware suppression.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The perpetrators specialize their blackmailer software according to the observations of malwarebytes in view of attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the ransom amount to be extorted is significantly higher than for private users.
“We are currently watching an appallingly rapid evolution of malware,” malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski said in an interview with The World.
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the shift towards corporate attacks took place appallingly quickly in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim’s computer, it searches specifically for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the end-encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money – mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
However, where the personal photo database is at stake with private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is stopped.
Accordingly, the damage will be higher if a ransomware hits.
22 percent of affected German companies reported revenue losses from ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely shut down business, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of hospital records.
“We always say to the victims: don’t pay, you only promote the problem,” explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure’s security researchers examined user interfaces and contact with blackmailers and came to the conclusion: The perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites, or decrypt example files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-figure sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from ransomware suppression, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos explains: “An individual can write a ransomware in about a week.”
However, it is more likely that they are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software build kit to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
“Includes an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed,” says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log in to one of the forums in the background, buy the set from a criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then charge spammers with the distribution," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust that ransomware can be protected through file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
“If encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators instead threaten to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations,” explains malwarebytes chief executive Marcin Kleczynski.
Depending on the nature of the data, the damage potential is still much higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also raise completely new targets on the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get an internet-connected thermostat under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating to some victims could be worth a ransom.
If the perpetrators then block an entire manufacturing road in a factory instead of heating in the future, ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was designed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V looks rather small, the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the bottom, it doesn’t work anywhere close.
The materials of the interior are well processed and seem pleasant, only the top of the cockpit drops slightly.
More versatile than comparable vehicles, the HR-V is in the storage space.
There is not only a trunk of 453 l at elevated and 1026 l at folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seating areas of the back bench can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus provide storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very strongly thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he is expected to do his job a little quieter.
The daily consumption is 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
The direction should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves no wishes open in the tested top version "Executive".
The safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (operates up to temp 32), the collision warning system and the Track Stop Assist.
The collision warning sometimes irritates because it assesses many obstacles when ranking as "repeated objects".
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent timer responds to traffic sign recognition and speeds up if necessary.
However, full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and an HDMI jack are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.
The around 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are in order.
If you don’t want to invest that much, you will get the petrol from 20,000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust gas standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable for: crash on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because liability is only conceivable in case of hazards typical of air traffic, the Oberlandesgericht D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14) argued.
The plaintiff had broken a knee disc during the crash.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay the man compensation.
Illness case: When the organizer pays
Sick vacationers will only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case when more than ten percent of guests have proven to show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family on the second day of their Turkish holiday was severely affected by diarrhea and vomiting.
She spent almost the entire vacation in the room.
Her illness led the vacationers to a faulty sewage treatment plant that allegedly contaminated the seawater.
The family was of the opinion that the trip was deficient - and complained against the organiser.
The plaintiffs did not succeed in court.
In fact, the cleaning system was defective.
But the organiser only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
Until then, he had to assume that the sea water was fine.
So he did not violate his information obligations, according to the judgment.
For example, no contaminants were found in the water samples.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infecting each other - is a general risk of life.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburg and Ansbach in July, many people would be worried about further attacks.
The state must act decisively and at the same time respond to terrorist threats.
It is certain that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this victory to the terrorists.
However, if criminals had to leave the country more quickly, this would increase security and also strengthen the people’s approval of refugee policy.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re wants to achieve implementation of the proposals by the 2017 federal election.
He also announced a further personnel reinforcement of the security forces, "in the middle quadruple order over several years".
Sympathy for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance aims to improve the updating of gun law in such a way that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet becomes more difficult.
The last much-discussed duty of secrecy for doctors is to remain vigilant according to de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re’s words.
However, in dialogue with the medical community, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the danger of the citizens, he said with a view to, for example, mental symptoms.
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister believes that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
In order to prosecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re plans the use of hidden investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing security."
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has made a clear statement against actionism.
"This was an earmark for the sharpshooters in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re had previously rejected calls from the Union for a burka ban and the abolition of dual citizenship.
He considers a general ban on the enforcement of the law to be problematic for constitutional law.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
You can talk about rules such as road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green boss Simone Peter told the minister that he wants to simulate with ever-new anti-terror packages the power to act and act.
Left Party chief Bernd Riexinger said: "Flood slogans and a tightening of the right of residence no longer bring security to the people of this country."
Better traffic flow on the motorway transporter
It is regularly on the bypass road - here is a picture of November.
But that should change: the legal loop should be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic on the surrounding road every night when they are driving over the motorway (A 43).
The Stra<0xC3><0x9F>enbau Landesbetrieb will extend the legal tender track by 700 metres in the area between Hammer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e and the Weseler Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e exit on Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August).
Drivers can then enter directly from the Hammer road on the right.
The big advantage: the traffic splits more early, which improves the overall running on the busy section of Bundesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 51.
The idea with the extended exit was represented by the CDU group in the district of M<0xC3><0xBC>nster-West.
The narrowing of the road on the Zubringer annoys drivers especially between 17 and 19 hours.
On weekdays, the backflow reaches the bridge via the Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle hole on the B 51 just before the departure of Weseler Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
From here, the traffic is routed only one-way via the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well a quarter of a century ago.
The reason: Static calculations had resulted in the bridge no longer having the necessary carrying capacity to mainly accommodate heavy-duty traffic in two lanes.
How long this narrow pass and the associated working day-to-day stalemate will last cannot be said by the national operator in charge.
However, it can be expected with years: because the bridge has an official shelf life until 2034.
For the prolongation of the legal loophole, the state-owned company has consciously chosen the weak time in the school holidays, because there are obstacles to be expected.
The traffic is carried out on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at the construction site.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The Invisible House".
The Nima's Association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima's Association allows young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in M<0xC3><0xBC>nster.
The "Klasse International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Jungen Theater M<0xC3><0xBC>nster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by Nima's association, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 attended the stage in the Kleine Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in M<0xC3><0xBC>nster as part of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came to M<0xC3><0xBC>nster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016 and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic pictures and video animations, it was possible for them to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Young Theatre M<0xC3><0xBC>nster.
The Nima's Association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without refugee and migration backgrounds between the ages of 14 and 20 will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the increasing number of refugees, the association expects many classes that want to participate.
Rain instead of star clusters: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star-climbing geckos in the southwest of Germany at night to Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope.
The night was poorly suited for observing the celestial spectacle because of clouds and rain, the chairman of the observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, said on Friday morning.
Our hope lies in the night to Saturday.
The weather should be good, then we will definitely see many star clusters in the sky.
The constellations are Perseids, which are among the fastest stellar clusters at 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful night: tips against sleep disorders
In the evening you wander around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think about sleep long before waking up.
This is anything but relaxing.
After all, one is in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep is often or permanently unrecognizable.
How do you deal with sleep problems or sleep disorders?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be caused by a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans-G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Wee<0xC3><0x9F>, a board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What you understand on a land-based basis, however, is insomnia, i.e. a sleep disturbance.
It is precisely sleep that many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of directors of the German Haus<0xC3><0xA4>rzteverband with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
There may be organic, mental or behavioral factors, but also medications.
Not infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
“Very early awakening is especially common in depression,” says Wee<0xC3><0x9F>.
And it can be that different factors depend on each other.
For example, anyone with a tape disc incident may be ill, wakes up every two to three hours, and may start snoring about everyday problems and worries, Wee<0xC3><0x9F> gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Anyone who does not sleep well for a period of one month at least three nights a week and is affected by the day should go to the doctor, advises Wee<0xC3><0x9F>.
The impairment can look very different: one is knocked down, tired, unsleeping, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headaches.
In order to alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, or even medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - are in question.
There are hardly any licensed sleep physicians in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center of the Charité Universit<0xC3><0xA4>tsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, when sleeping problems should first be addressed to the GP, advises Wee<0xC3><0x9F>.
He can explain with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens?
For examination in the sleep lab, doctors advise, for example, in snoring with respiratory arresters, in sick daytime fatigue, in sleepwalkers, or if the cause of sleep disturbance is not found, explains Fietze.
You don’t have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
“Please don’t make lunch,” Fietze says.
After wiring, you go to bed at its normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nose glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleepers.
How can those affected get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a lot of adjustment screws on which you can put on for a better sleep.
Wee<0xC3><0x9F> counts: Regular sleep and wake-up times, not lying in bed for too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start counting right away, and this is not really conducive.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has announced on Facebook that the DSV team at Olympis has been cut off.
In December 2014, he won gold at the Doha Short Track World Championships for the first time, setting his first world record.
The former DSV-athlete Markus Deibler has now faced his former teammates who are in the spotlight via Facebook.
“In a country where an Olympic winner receives a prize of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20,000 and a jungle king of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000, no one should be surprised about missing medals,” the 26-year-old wrote on Friday night on his Facebook page.
The support system in swimming sports is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not look as closely or even operate on the topic of doping.
“I’m not saying that the controls should be stopped here,” he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deviler would have to be notified nine months before his first launch by the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That’s the way it should be with countries.
“Those who cannot be controlled by independent WADA/FINA controllers for a certain period of time before the World Cup/OS are not allowed to participate,” demanded the election citizen, who is now running an ice rink.
Airport: Bands of baggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf Airport
Civilians of the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61 on Thursday.
As a gang, the suspects had committed several pocket and luggage thefts.
By 9.30 p.m., civil officials at the airport in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf recognized a gang known to the police for past theft offences.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July this year and had done so jointly, partly and particularly professionally.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had specifically entered Germany for the commission of crimes.
In total, they had raised over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, in the meantime another remnant of the headstone plaster: The Rigaer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first glance, but the police are among the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you will pass by playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bio loading.
On the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of a gray house someone sprayed "fuck!"
Opposite of a Lidl, which is also to be demolished soon, is already being built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created here.
However, articles about this "trendy district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, are preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the residents have rental agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel has repeatedly called the area a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.
On June 22, after the rooms on the ground floor, the Cadderschmiede, with 300 police officers, were cleared, the police patrolled for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on site, blocking parts of the street and keeping visitors from crossing the house.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the evacuation had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the cheer of sympathisers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the road seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the boulevard in front of the houses in the sun, others talk before late.
There are a primary school and kindergartens in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It does not sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing leftists.
The trenches that the Berlin interior senator and the police open up between the occupants and their neighbors do not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which still has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the resulting housing projects have long belonged to Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street very close to the Rigas.
While the Mainzers had been cleared in a regular street battle under a large police order, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still partly inhabited today by the people they occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world: with them now residents from GDR times and former homeowners share their kiez.
This is also evident in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 in the case of new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: they can be seen on curved disks or freshly painted fa<0xC3><0xA7>ades, which were thrown with colored bags.
No other road has been mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-wing violence".
One reason why not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: Crimes such as bodily injury are almost exclusively directed against police officers according to statistics.
Most of the crimes are property damage, which tends to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
When it comes to violence, it’s frightening: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who certainly weren’t.
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist directly in the Rigaer.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than anywhere else".
Neugebauer has consciously moved into Rigaer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e - and stayed.
That’s why it was so important for the residents to get their way back: from the police, the politics and the media, all of whom suddenly demanded the interpretation of the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents such as new builders, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that displace the old inhabitants.
“These are, after all, real estate apartments that aren’t interesting for many here – people who aren’t so well looked after live here,” she says.
"Violence and destruction I absolutely can't heal."
But what should you do if you never listen to anyone?
There is frustration on all sides, including with the police and the residents.
For those who are angry about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: The house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.
Who pulls out should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub district can complain badly about noise there.
All persons presented only with first names have asked not to be named with their proper name
Urbach: Annika Deuschle is the new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuchle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuchle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social pedagogy supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, refugee assistance working group, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine customer from the workgroup suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-bearing wool milk sauce, which has a problem especially.
Thus, some – less mocking than rather targeting the variety of desired task areas – had meant that the administration wanted to post the post.
An administrative power was sought with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an egg-bearing wool milk sauce.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuchle.
It is mainly about organization, working with the people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been here for about six weeks.
It has fixed a 50 per cent position for three years.
“It was high time,” says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and principal actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon there will be new containers in Wasenstra<0xC3><0x9F>e
A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection.
You must accommodate the refugees in your own or rented living rooms.
The costs for the construction, rental or renovation of these properties must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to Kommune and Jobcenter.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find any private apartments.
It does not work so far, depending on private apartments, says Deuchle.
Therefore, communal apartments must be fostered, as it is called so beautiful.
So soon new containers will be set up in Wasenstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
But it is not done only with apartments.
Perspective is the key word, Regina Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a fixed stay, there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.
“More places would be good,” reports Regine customer.
Many work in the construction yard or help housewives, do charitable work - and this is motivated and very orderly, as Annika Deuchle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
It's not "employment therapy."
But work does not mean just work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
This is where the administration and volunteers come in.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are desired and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedure is a problem.
You have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach, must not work and be useless, will never integrate.
The vast majority is motivated.
However, there are also cases of problems, says customer honestly, "People who do not go at all". The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.
It's all a "mom job."
A difficult question: Are the two afraid of radicalization after recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine customer quite clearly, "what some may call na<0xC3><0xAF>ve." A residual risk can and does not exclude it.
Helpers have already been sensitized.
These incidents are also a topic for refugees.
They were afraid that the assassins would bring them to full condemnation.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,” says Regine customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So, the main and volunteers have to keep an eye out for activities on site and in the region.
They have always in the background that a new clash of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, the policy is horrendous.
Actually, it's unfair to put them helpers on the spot.
“In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we are,” says Annika Deuchle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already exhausted from integrating the previous people in a reasonable way.
There are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But if people are in need, you have to help them, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complicated because there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Searched for breaker with helicopter
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men entered an apartment in a multi-family house on the Lindenweg at about 8.50 am on Friday morning.
The resident surprised the two and beat the unstoppable into flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, wearing both blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled towards downtown.
The police used several strip crews as well as a police helicopter to capture them.
The hunt went on without success.
Perhaps the unknown fell before the act near the apartment or during their escape.
Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg: Police find out after rocker attack on Imbiss
Following an attack on an Ulmer imbiss, police are investigating six suspects from the rocker environment for serious land peace violations.
Evidence and drug use have been secured in the case of housing searches, police said on Friday.
About 20 masked men of a rock-like group had thrown bottles and stones at the window of an ambush, according to police in July.
After that, they were supposed to have attacked two guests and slightly injured one.
Then they fled.
A damage of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10000 occurred on the premises and the adjacent building.
According to investigators, there is a dispute in the Ulmer rocker environment between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
