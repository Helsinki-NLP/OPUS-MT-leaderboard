Inflation in Europe has hit the food market.
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 euro area countries was more significant compared to forecasts, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, the European Community Statistics Office in Luxembourg said.
Official forecasts have indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the key interest rate by saying that the decline in interest rates, with commodity prices rising and unemployment falling, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two per cent.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: “we must deter” inflation in order not to have to intervene on this subject any longer.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a record over the past twelve years and in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
The futures market for cereals has increased by 88 per cent and the price of soybeans has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the global oil price rose 52 percent, and last month, a barrel of black gold cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will increase from 2.1, this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, in the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce the guiding rate twice in 2008.
Gallup says government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz supporters (the Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly in early December, so since 2002, it now has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (the Poll Institute) has never before seen such low socialist support, i.e. 13 per cent.
For loyal voters, the difference would represent, because of the opposition’s greatest determination, more than two-thirds (71 percent) of the support against the support of a fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent across the population.
Of the faithful voters certain to go to vote, the number of supporters of the two parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate compared to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who felt that the country's economic situation was particularly severe was never as high, rising to 41 per cent and, according to 46 per cent, the situation is quite severe.
After the more optimistic outlook of spring and summer last year, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population anticipates an aggravation and only a tenth foresees an improvement in the situation.
In December, 71 percent of people surveyed, a majority never seen in previous Gallup polls, said the prime minister was doing his job rather poorly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny while 38 percent support Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that discontent with the prime minister can be treated without change of government.
While after the October riots, 35 per cent of the respondents wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, at present this rate is only 20 per cent; the relative majority (33 per cent) believes that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of voting intent, 60 percent of respondents said they would certainly vote, and 20 percent said that they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 per cent of those polled would certainly participate and 15 per cent of those polled would probably participate.
74 per cent of people would say no to enrollment fees in higher education, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees and 84 per cent would say no to hospital stay fees.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital stay fees.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by nearly twenty percent
The hypermarkets located in the Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs commercial triangle have kept the average price increase of 16 percent last year to the difference that this year the VAT rate has not increased.
Article of Daily Economy (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs, the usual daily Christmas Basket also increased by 16 percent on average, a value increase significantly higher than a thousand forints was shown in all hypermarkets.
Prices, “which had already flown” in major food stores in December, have not risen sharply compared to the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded the psychological threshold of at least 91 forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year’s level, however the prices of turkey net, walnut and turkey have risen sharply.
In the shops, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, we found bread of one kilo at 139 forints only.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of Coca-Cola’s registered two-liter bottle was below 200 forints, so it only cost 257 forints the registered bottle including.
It only prevents this year, in terms of Daily Basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the least expensive.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its daily Basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing the cheapest basket of last year and the cheapest basket of this year, we find a 12 percent difference whereas the difference between the cheapest basket of last year and the most expensive basket of this year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by 1,480 forints on average.
Last year, prices rose by an average of 1,206 forints, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noticeable in last year’s Christmas prices.
This process has complicated trade, hypermarkets could not clearly determine what margin to apply to products as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he may lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the increase in the prices of the Daily Basket has changed so excessively that the most expensive basket was over 1,720 forints to the value of the 2006 one, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the most expensive basket was higher than last year’s 1,630 forints and prices at least increased by 1,284 forints as well.
As we approached the two Christmas seasons, we saw a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer items increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some essential foods, the Institute of Statistics found a price increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to the Daily Basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has barely increased by more than 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have succeeded in making the price increase brutally accepted by multinationals as well.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experience, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-preservated food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, large queues formed at the boxes of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased abruptly.
But, according to our information, the turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to survey companies that they do not even reach the projected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals are making savings on disinfectants.
This year, more than a thousand infections, caused mainly by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overcrowding of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals also make savings on disinfectants.
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the traumatology department of the J<0xC3><0xA1>nos hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been detected in a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The victim of a serious car accident left the hospital but soon after he had to return due to an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to do him an important operation because of the bacteria that is in his body.
Until 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multidrug-resistant pathogen were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz, chief physician at the National Epidemiology Center.
Namely, it is the number of infections caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. by methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One-third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SAs (such as angina, amygdalitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which responds well to antibiotics, will develop a bacterium that is well resistant to antibiotics that will proliferate quickly in bad hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as a traumatic infection or septicemia, on elderly patients, small weights or having a weakened organism.
According to the director of the J<0xC3><0xA1>nos hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
Above all, we should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only, or we do not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
“These patients are isolated, the nursing staff put on rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, however, the infection cannot always be avoided.
The sampling of the sample is not in fashion
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances are not favorable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
As this infection manifests itself mainly in hospitals and seniors’ residences, hospitals should control hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these reviews.
Most cases can only be seen if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the head doctor of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and basic care, Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz said.
Many hospitals are making savings on disinfectants.
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferated from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks, but important gaps are detected in hospitals also in this area.
MRSA proliferated by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to the conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in terms of epidemic, the patients should be kept away from each other by a minimum of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in difficult financial situations, make savings on disinfectants, they lack nurses, the patients are numerous, so the risk of contamination is even greater, Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz said.
According to Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or then the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenses for social security funds, which is why we fight this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to the published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) sets out among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) as well as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, the author of a fatal accident, was not in a state of intoxication
The official finding concerning the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement was drawn up.
It can be ruled out that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has resigned from his position since, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, was in a state of drunkenness or dizziness, said Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the capital’s public ministry after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation, which has already found that the former commissioner had not consumed alcohol before getting on the wheel.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd arrondissement commissary crushed a 55-year-old man who found himself in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, into the 22nd arrondissement Kossuth Lajos Street.
(By the way, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian passage does not constitute a mitigating circumstance, according to the Road Code a car that starts a turn must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and requested his retirement because, according to the police, this accident has upset him a lot.
The investigation into this case is carried out by the Prosecutor's Office responsible for the Budapest investigations.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the outset with the magistrates in charge of conducting the investigation.
An additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, Hungarian Minister of Finance, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements with a total value of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million in Budapest on Friday to support education, transport infrastructure and the environment.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for the Hungarian budget for the financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, a credit agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million already signed by the parties.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million credit agreement also concerns the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungary, the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million can be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope in the first place as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the project of the metro line 4 was also addressed.
The parties agreed that they would discuss the possible modification of the initial contract once Hungary has finalised the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has allocated a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its appropriations according to the interest rate related to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without commitment commission.
Bulgaria, a paradise for the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this Balkan country little mentioned in the past.
What, or who bought on this EU market that is always the cheapest but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular destination in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses by the cheap sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "C<0xC3><0xB4>te du Soleil", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but they are more and more numerous to look for a building in the region of Kavarna and Balk as well.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also awaken the interest of investors and they are also more and more numerous to buy in the very inexpensive corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, offers attractive opportunities as well, with business and office spaces promising the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on track to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
The more vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are simultaneously looking to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. At the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old detached houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, proximity to a large city, shops and generally that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since last December, Bulgaria is listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving a medium or long-term surplus value.
The price of the capital’s buildings is constantly rising as a result of an increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria; however, in the last 5 years, they have increased by 21 per cent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to the communication of G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Waters, the meetings of the professionals end on Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which is expected to define the efforts to be made after the Kyoto Protocol’s emission reduction period until 2012.
At the moment, there are lively discussions on this issue between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, at the moment, they did not want to discuss exact figures, although they were prepared to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent compared to 1990 levels by 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries are committed, except for emissions reductions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries that need it.
An agreement was also signed on the assistance to be provided to developing countries.
The support fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board of directors likely within the framework of the United Nations Global Environment Facility (GEF), Piac és Profit (Market and Profit) said in a statement.
Six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Waters, confirms the EU’s ambition to keep its role as a flagship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the “Agreement after 2012”, and was ready to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30 per cent and also to reduce their capacity by 30 per cent in all other major regions.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol signatory countries had aimed at a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and the total of the 15 EU members of that time took the commitment by 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the 1985-87 period, and our country will fulfil its commitment, the Ministry of the Environment said in a press release.
The issue is big in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be implemented within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the international commitments to reduce below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the Earth's average temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
Units of the British Army communicate, on the video-sharing site, recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to become popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) who became passionate about YouTube: special units operating in Afghanistan upload video footage of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the Air Force Headquarters in Kandahar and are then transferred to London or uploaded to the Internet by compatriots.
The political message is essential
Air Force soldiers have already spent 139 sequences on the net through this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered under the name "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and broadcasts videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the international peacekeeping forces also have their own YouTube channel (MNFI).
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were posted on the net to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defense, they were also used to make the public aware of the real objectives of the presence of the army abroad.
The propaganda published by this channel costs almost nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, a statement to the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defense consultant, on the other hand, also inevitably carries a political message as it justifies in a special way the well-founded military operations by the government.
The Americans made a game.
The army is disturbed because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos are passed on the sharing site that also present the death of soldiers: in the “official” propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers never avoid talking about the losses but he does not care.
In fact, many videos had already been posted on the network showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only recently been packing for the loading of these videos.
The Americans do the recruitment a little differently using the America's Army shooting game that can be downloaded for free. In this game the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and beignets in ministries
M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by taking beignets and coffee.
Another ministry will host a party with live music, another will enchant the officials with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so the power is amused.
Public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defense but it is not the Ministry employees who will be invited to it.
At Christmas, Orphelins, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for the missionary Christmas, the family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The ministry plans a budget of 25 million forints to create the year-end atmosphere.
Compared to other ministries, the National Development Agency (NF<0xC3><0x9C>) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM celebration will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the six hundred employees in bulk, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NF<0xC3><0x9C> Christmas costs 4,700,000 forints and was held Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (ILO) building with concerts and a dinner.
The rent of the room costs one million forints, the rest has been spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NF<0xC3><0x9C> is invited to another Christmas party which is organized with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a tender management company.
The building of the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre de la Ga<0xC3><0xAE>té was rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt as we have not been able to reach the person responsible.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building hosted not only the NF<0xC3><0x9C> but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, organized a ball on the occasion of St. Luca on December 7.
The ILO did not make them pay for the use of its rooms.
The ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the minister’s welcome words and the dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the evening was not mandatory at all at this ball.
The ministries of health, work and local communities are preparing a sobre party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite her employees to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected who will be invited to have a coffee and eat beignets, the press service said, the party will cost as much as 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Communities, will simply invite his collaborators to take a drink in the Ministry of Local Communities and Territorial Planning classroom.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will host a Christmas party in its large room, which 436 employees are expected to attend.
It is expected to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a glass.
Since the arrival of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, PM employees have celebrated Christmas every year in the same way.
No planned party atmosphere, the official character is reinforced not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas holiday will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Forest, and according to the ministry’s communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started by a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, the press services reported to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike are gathering
The Unions of the League and the National Workers' Councils Association will form their strike committee on Friday, which will be responsible for coordinating Monday's indefinite strike.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the health insurance bill, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant traffic jams as rail traffic will be stopped almost entirely and employees of BKV (a public transport company) will also strike until 1 p.m.
The Unions of the League will announce on Friday afternoon the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Workers' Councils Association.
The strike committee of LIGA - MOSZ will also be constituted, it will serve as the coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and, starting Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the health insurance bill, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not pass the health insurance law, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the next step.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the health insurance bill will only take place late in the evening, even at night.
Due to the planned strike on Monday, important plugs are planned in circulation: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and in the morning a portion of public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for a strike, the list of which is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report the strike for an indeterminate period, others said a temporary work stoppage.
Until Thursday afternoon the M<0xC3><0x81>V (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Trade Union of Railways (VDSZSZ) have not managed to find an agreement on minimum services, but, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are taking the train.
According to the current communications, Budapest public transport will strike from the start of service until 1pm, Budapest airport between 7am and 9am, the Industrial Trade Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike at 2am, the Trade Union of Teachers and the Union of Teachers during 2 hours.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country alternately, the Health and Social Workers' Union (EDDSZ) affiliated to the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, formulated by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new design to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be implemented from next year be introduced in several steps.
The third claim requires a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, that would allow the functions that deserve to be passed into the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Trade Union of Railways (VDSZSZ) of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary railways and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard increased the country’s risk
According to the Political Capital (Risk Analysing Division) Risk Analysis Division, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyar<0xC5><0xA1>zr<0xC3><0xA1>szért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increases, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risk warning”, the company notes that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that “in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes may occur as a result of the worsening ethnic tension already existing between the Gypsy and non-gypsy population of Hungary”.
The research institute added that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard likely to provoke this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: “Public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groups who have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Tzigans and the Hungarians.”
The problem is getting worse, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are getting stronger and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
But, according to the research institute, under the effect of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard “has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular regarding confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country”.
They recall that, as a result of increased publicity given to the reorganization of radical and far-right Hungarian groups since the autumn of 2006, many associations have been established in Hungary since the summer of 2007 with the name "National Self-Defense Association".
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their members for defense missions (catastrophic, national defense, defence of order), armed, if necessary, and mention the ineptitude of
They reported that everything was going according to the method that, based on the rancor of political society and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions from a civil point of view.
The emphasis on civil character and association status therefore serves not only to avoid the legal pitfalls of the registration of these associations in the court, but they also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk compared to neighbouring relations.
“In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and ultranationalist political actors from certain neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard’s constitution.
This influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased across the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many troubles of Rome that broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are at the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the UNB decided to set up a guard by saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defense".
According to them, over the past 17 years, the Gypsies have “terrified” Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debates in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by certain Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the constitution of their own guard as a means of resistance indicates an increase in the risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, can be read in the Risk Warning of Political Capital.
At the request of the telegraphic agency, Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, Research Director at Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could have an impact on the change of risk, they inform the public, as in the present case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common practice to reorganize the working days, the number of which will decrease next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and the US either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as rest days.
Rest days are often associated with religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the latter especially so that the wakers can rest peacefully.
In a year, we have eleven red-marked parties.
March 15 is a national holiday, commemorating the revolution of 1848, as well as October 23 which is the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on May 1 is the feast of labor and on November 1 and 2, we remember members of our family and our deceased friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, at Pentecost and at Christmas.
The days of our state holidays, national or even religious that rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases or there is only one working day left before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of the extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday preceding the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in a special regulation on the days of replacement of the days before or after the holidays.
The law extends to all employers and to all their employees, civil servants and persons working in the public service.
However, it does not apply to service companies, institutions that run uninterruptedly and in service, by their vocation, and also to days of rest.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life stops almost all over the country because according to experiments most people do overtime or take holidays that they have saved for these purposes to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The schedule will be reorganised for the first time around the Labor Day to allow employees to stay at home for four consecutive days.
Saturday 25 April will be a working day to have a rest day on Friday 2 May.
Another change is planned for October 23: Saturday, October 18, will be a working day replacing Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.
Six Useful Things That Can Terrificly Disturb Colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost more: these are things that “beautify” a workplace’s daily life.
The question is whether we are getting used to these problems or whether we are addressing the challenge and consciously avoiding ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
“Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called to the marketing service,” a colleague tells you.
That you missed an appointment?
At best he’s sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing service to tell them he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, this is done with excuses.
Before you have painful explanations, it is helpful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There’s nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool, or the phone and you can’t find them anywhere.
Do you remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk but she disappeared the next morning?
Do you accidentally find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague’s desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking, otherwise they're right to be angry at you for biting their property.
Do not bring envelopes, post-it in your pocket as it can be annoying that there is no more and that you need them right away.
Do you want the privacy of your colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop potions that spread.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don’t tell everyone your information (suppositions) about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don’t abuse his trust!
Bury the information you share and don’t discuss it with your colleagues in their absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you declaring yourself sick for no good reason?
When you call the office and you declare yourself sick on the pretext of a tearful headache because you feel sick or you think you need rest that day, think of the fact that your work, your urgent business, your future missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you are not going to work or that something can happen that would force you to stay at home, don’t forget to warn your boss and colleagues to avoid them being surprised by your absence the next day.
Peace, enrichment, telephone
You're diving into your work, but the wealth of your co-workers is getting you out of it?
Did you become, unwittingly, a witness to a phone conversation that you would have done better not to listen to?
Don’t bother your colleagues with sneezing, chanting, loud conversations (which you lead above their heads), kicks, big words, or loud-voiced dissatisfaction.
They may bother even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing others of a fault?
If your work is not done for the set time, you forget to send an important email or message, don’t blame anyone for this forget!
Do not put it on the account of any chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you made a mistake and if it presented inconveniences to others, fix the mistake!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix negligence!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Putting on a jogging and socks is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Do not put comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Don’t forget, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by putting on nice and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you are no longer interesting
We move slowly into the usual morning stopper.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm making a sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones of the hour, then a female choral joins it like a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcast Zagar's song Wings of Love.
Hungarian musical life has not spoiled us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it looks like the cap is going to be different if you listen to Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few new interesting productions born from the Hungarian digital underground begin gradually to change the overall picture and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger came from Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he set out on his own path, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an ally of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to make themselves known when he was entrusted with the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The season of Ferenc T<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>k).
The band initially playing in small clubs began to be known to a wider audience when wan2 magazine cited their first 2002 album among the 50 biggest albums on the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend who would also be competitive.
Zagar and his ensemble have become indisputably "trendy" but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label well.
The band reacted as they should, released a new and better album.
The album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, may open new avenues for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
This was a line from the former Pécs group of Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
We are fine with the reference to flying but next to the aerial music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the strongest guitar, impact of rock and roll.
Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rgy Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the first album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, we find a real radio tube, Mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the Wings of Love melodies recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is going well (?).
hvg.hu is the place to ask questions in Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: is your music well left a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs: The term music aimed at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The so-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be honest, too.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
The, people go to concerts not only the young ones of ten or twenty years old but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes that have occurred in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested to know who, or how many people are listening to your music?
Zs.B.: I’m obviously glad to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or mutual influence is already working, but it is only perceived in the unfathomable changes of the moment.
Now, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you wouldn't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He worked alone and had a career in the West.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who have confidence in each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, it was inevitable that our music would be compared to Yonderboi’s because we are many to leave his band and take another path.
hvg.hu: On the palmar<0xC3><0xA8>s of mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi, Wings of Love occupies the first place.
Many people have heard the name Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style did you consciously open up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't plan to make a tube to sell the disc.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the most difficult themes addressed throughout the album.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why are they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choral of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus the six-member choir was composed, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enih<0xC3><0xBA> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was then named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This song already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing from this song.
The set of chords attracted the voice of the song.
I even sang the song the girls later learned at night.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time but certainly we needed Divas.
With my voice she would not have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There are no solos (except for a short solo by Judy Jay), they don’t have a single role, they all sing together and they don’t sing louder than music, so music doesn’t just accompany their song.
They were behind the scene as well.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only a technical problem.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we have to forget our ego a little, forget who comes from where, who goes, or, we just have to let those wings, the wings of love, take us.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: Actually, nothing about the process of music creation, we had more difficult songs during the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything set up like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I’ve already “released” this album.
At the moment, they are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader is at risk of billions because of his inferiority complex
A stealthy fraudster.
Thus, its former employee designates the French giant Société générale, owner of the Czech bank Komer<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xAD> banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros because of him.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is just a great player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, in addition, can never be considered incapable.
Unlike all major banks, it has acknowledged in time the crisis of the U.S. mortgage market.
"He's fragile," his superiors said, who denounced him to the police.
However, if you follow Kerviel’s statement reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man’s transactions at the end of last year generated a profit of 1.6 billion euros.
The crisis is beyond the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the American crisis to win half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that so-called "sub-prime" mortgages, granted to low-income customers or those who had encountered difficulties in repayment in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he made a good bet.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
“As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn’t know how to announce it,” Kerviel said, adding that he had, of course, kept nothing for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits to having forged the reports so as not to be detected.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his trades.
Who doesn’t risk anything has nothing
Was he afraid of being discovered?
No, I'm not.
"I estimated that the mere fact that I got $1.6 billion for the bank was going to satisfy them."
Where does his willingness to take such a big risk come from?
He has only been in his position gradually.
He started working at the Société Générale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant trader and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never win as much as the others.
“From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal career,” Kerviel told investigators.
However, shortly after taking office, he won his first major success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz, he gained half a billion euros by betting on the decline of this title during the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you alone
“There was a snowball effect,” he told police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"As long as I won, they seemed to close their eyes."
This is where the start of the year comes in.
He loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion because of him.
And how has it been discovered?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
“Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another,” concludes Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech government ministers signed in a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
This represents about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly SEK 125 billion from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns as part of the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit the most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of NOK 90.8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Businesses should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of more effective new management methods.
Up to now, the Czech Republic was among the new members to be the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds.
The Tribunal has confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for a $100 million fraud (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released and was assigned to residence in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of this Central American state, as a function between 1997 and 2002, will be re-incarcerated is currently unclear, according to the AP.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison officers, either they will let German finish his sentence at home, or they will go back to prison again.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n regularly moved the government’s money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These were fictitious societies and the accounts were in reality owned by members of his family and his closest supporters.
Some of this money went into the funds that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n had created to fund his election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's the way it is.
The state budget has been adopted.
Why is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford his refusal.
Contrary to the heated debate preceding the vote on the government’s declaration of defiance, this time nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies passed this law without any problems, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is kind of a paradox.
Whether you like it or not, each chapter and each article is the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, though hidden behind the competition of power opposing government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive to the media and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
The disputes of political men are much more interested in opinion than the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three evils that the current budget is not fit to deal with at the same time:
The first being the significant share of mandate costs imposed by the law, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social burdens, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M parties.
The second being a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle, he, is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the state budget deficit that represents the biggest disadvantage.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real delay bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued, in vain, obligations, disproportionately indebted to their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from the money from taxes, tax duties and bank loans, new sources of investment.
In the past years, they were able to repay these debts by mass selling of the shares of distribution systems, in particular those of energy obtained by the state in the context of privatizations.
Today, they no longer have that source.
If the facts are based solely on official and verifiable facts, it is noted that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, as well as the rest of the world, and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is not short of it.
This was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they were indebted to the state more and more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
This is a monstrous shame that falls mainly on previous governments.
We are one of the countries that, on a global scale, are the least threatened by poverty.
We therefore do not need massive social programmes which, precisely in recent years, have, unfortunately, unnecessarily inflated themselves.
Although we have succeeded in removing some of the absurd populist spending, approved last year before the elections, if a shift in the age limit for retirement, as well as a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and will cease to exist in that country.
With little exaggeration, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become bureaucrats who mechanically distribute the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes ordinary costs to be pushed back by mandate costs.
The expected deficit of $70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not dissipated all the money they could.
If we don't really want to see politics in power become simple bureaucrats, we have to be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what happens to tax and tax reform, the calm of the necessary new pre-tax reform.
Only the latter will be able to progressively achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial markets crisis together.
Over one hundred billion dollars will thus be placed on the monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for the banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
As an example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to the auctions and, in addition, it will provide 24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the attacks on 11 September that the central banks of individual states have decided to take action at this concerted point, aimed at preventing or even reducing the effects of the financial crisis.
“This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report to clients.
“The concerted action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl said in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unreimbursed loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still waiting for more losses in billions.
“If the central banks have chosen this approach, it’s that they really need to understand what can still go on,” said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he added.
The central banks fear that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their clients.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could impact global economic growth.
The central banks made this choice after they failed to bring down the London interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual loans, even though the U.S., Canadian and English central banks had repeatedly reduced their interest rates during the fall.
“This will have the same effect as a new interest rate drop,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central bank’s approach will not help to curb the crisis, as it does not address the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the US.
President Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change is expected to harm developing countries in particular.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus has spoken again on the issue of global warming.
This time, the international conference on climate change ended in Bali was met with critical acclaim.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of the environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a curious mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between accompanying rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a word rocket, ersatz solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, in the presentation of his book, that his subject matter is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction with what his book also appears in German translation, since, he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
From now on, interested people can read their positions without being deformed.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless, in his opinion, has enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The major conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following theses: the climate is constantly evolving, the changes in it are therefore normal, there is no opinion shared by all the researchers on global warming, the effects of the current changes are neither too important nor too severe, so the effects of the current changes are not so important and do not affect them in any way, they do not affect them in any way, nor do they affect them too much.
All the more so than having the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose inverted opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous breach of freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against an integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between costs and the profit they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people have failed to renew their driver’s license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their old driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day that people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities are able to grant them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid permits will take the road.
According to the authorities, they did not renew their licence to drive especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While municipalities report a drop in the number of applications for renewal of the permit, authorities in the capital are invading applications and the number of applications for renewal of the permit has increased this week.
The City Hall caters to about 2000 customers per day.
There's a tail of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licenses.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request the delivery within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Drivers who will not be able to carry out the mandatory renewal of the driver's license by the end of the year and will take the road without a valid license will be liable, as of January, for a fine.
The offender will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence by resorting to a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2500 crowns.
According to ancient information, even a person who was not going to circulate was likely to be fined.
In doing so, she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1,000 crowns.
However, according to the Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's license is, according to him, a document that people can decide if they want to have it or not.
It is not like with the identity card which, it, must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer wish to drive should return their driver’s license.
It is enough to bring it or send it to the relevant municipality.
The driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 have another three years to carry out the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal reduced the sentences of the detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, former police officers accused of conniving with the gang of David Berdych, will serve thirteen and ten years in prison respectively.
The Supreme Court of Prague thus condemned them definitively by reducing their sentences of 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Originally, detectives from the Department for the Fight against Organized Crime risked 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, only an appeal to the Superior Court is conceivable.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is currently awaiting only the trial verdict.
However, he has already received in other trials punishments, the amount of which exceeds 16 years in prison.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal found guilty of participation in hold-ups of 19 persons, and the Superior Tribunal today dealt with appeals from 16 of them.
Most of the defendants had, since the beginning of the investigation, questioned the charge by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, members of the police, after an agreement with Berdych among other things, transmitted to criminals information from police sources, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang sent 30 percent of the lark to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
The indictment refers to the gang's criminal activity between 1999 and 2001.
In essence, armed robbery, the victims of which, in most cases, have suffered serious harm to health, but also from the abuse of power of a public agent and prohibited armaments.
In home searches, the police have in fact discovered illegally held pistols, shells with a steel core, a laser pointer for direct shooting or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has been enriched by tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly twenty men from this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other hand-lifted flights Berdych and a whole host of other people.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still in court in another trial, some cases have not yet come to court.
The main hearing avoided, for the time being, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej currently living in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision regarding their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child replacement: 12 million
Igor Veleba, the lawyer of the families in distress, wants to obtain compensation of 12 million crowns plus expenses from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer at the Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l hospital disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, this one is very high," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said at the hearing.
"In order to be able to make an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the expert report of which the opposing party has ordered the drafting.
We will check whether it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov’s family demanded a million crowns for each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better supported by men, although they were faced with remorse for not being able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, they remain less serene in the face of trauma in the news and in the face of what is happening right now, the content of the Veleba report summarized.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital on December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>k in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanov<0xC3><0xA1> in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
The governor of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina region Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il handed over, at the end of October, 100,000 crowns to each of the families for reimbursement of expenses incurred by the error of the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are required by the Civil Liability Insurance Act.
In case of failure, they must draw in the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can request help from the manager.
Up to now, the courts recognized relatively low compensation, with amounts calculated according to the tables being in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka og perdu Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xA1> krajt<0xC3><0xA1>ny (le Royaume de Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko)
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka a perdu le litige au sujet de la marque Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské krajlovst<0xC3><0xAD> (Royaume de Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, he actually used the title King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, a former collaborator of the actor.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka was not present at today's hearing.
But, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasitic about the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko speak to everyone precisely this actor and comedian.
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> is of the same opinion.
“There is a work behind us of almost ten years.
"Research for money and development of events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
“After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to paralyze our work,” he added.
A Profitable Business
According to the court, it was Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka who first used the title Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD> kr<0xC3><0xA1>l (King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko) in his television show.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD> had crowned him king in 1993.
But at the time, this had nothing to do with the project of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing passports of the Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovst<0xC3><0xAD>.
From a humorous action originally emerged a lucrative business and commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, of the company Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovst<0xC4><0x9B>.
In 1997 Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka accepted that his name and signature be mentioned in the passport and even offered to the holders of the balances on the price of the visit of his farm and his theatre shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the nude idea, published by Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in the mane<0xC5><0xBE> show, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and certainly helped the Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské krajlovstv<0xC3><0xAD> project," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was constituted by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who devoted themselves intensively to the project.
Collaboration between the present-day enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
But from there, conflicts began to build up between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, who culminated in the deposition "of King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, assumed by the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> as the mother Queen.
Then, in 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a complaint against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, requesting that the court today reject.
What could make the case clear is the planned tournament for the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
He did not want to betray the details and the date.
“We don’t want to go fast in need.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slovakia.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can of course register,” Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
I’ve never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the change in speed, driving and also that of manufacturing could, in many respects, be described as below-average.
Now, there is its successor the Peugeot 207 on the market which, it, is significantly better.
The more the combo named SW goes a step further, the more I have to think about it.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207 I complained, for example, about the headspace on the rear seats.
While there finished the complaints because the combo bodywork means that even the great devils will be comfortable in this regard.
Let's see quickly done
I’m going to go inside very quickly so I don’t repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only remark about the central tunnel that I find poor.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, given that the car looks so stylish.
The seats are comfortable and the time when you could complain about seats or folders too short is over.
The lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to the model 206.
As for the space, the increase in the dimensions of the bodywork is sensitive there too.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the already mentioned head disappear.
A box in the box
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage rack.
I have to evaluate this as very accessible (also thanks to the rear rotating ice) and a fairly easy swivel.
The blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics which constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold objects heavy enough.
But let's stop at the volume.
This makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure relative to the competition.
Apart from the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle of this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mlada Boleslav product, we find that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on vacation abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to highlight the benefits, I would mention the bottom of the box remaining after the backrests of the perfectly straight back seats, or a very low walker.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And really, that’s what should look like a 1.6 that makes walking a family hatchback.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, grows well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by <0xC5><0xA0>koda that often gives the impression of having an escape pot sealed by a snake, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's go through the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable for everyone.
However, one must be aware that one has tested a fairly well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4-litre engine of 329 900 K<0xC4><0x8D> is still passable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80,000 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
In addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automatic control of the rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
That’s a lot, but try to add additional equipment to the price of the Fabia and you’ll get a very similar figure.
All that remains is to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students into the British schools is going badly
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing concern among the remaining children about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is, for the moment, facing a series of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where the conflict between the remaining and Slovak immigrants is beginning to intensify, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The disputes, the chicane and the pitfalls between the students have transposed into the relationships between the parents.
The situation went so far that police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who hit a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The accused defends herself by claiming that the boy had insulted her by racist remarks.
The police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two teenagers.
The young girls allegedly addressed this man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we got home, a young man climbed onto the bus stop and started to spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he responded with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks," another unpleasant adventure described a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the remaining members has gone so far as to call conflicts with immigrants struggling for survival.
The cases mentioned above testify that the atmosphere in British schools between the natives and immigrants begins to be strained.
70,000 Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can happen if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
Now, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
By the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana has become the deposit and the place of transfer of the treasures that the Spanish had stolen and that they were transporting to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, built it, since everything that was a crime in the US (especially under the ban) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients, there were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings have grown and cars, belonging to the iconic symbols of the 50’s of the last century, were circulating on the broad boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Coj<0xC3><0xAD>mar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the show business and the political men of all America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph yourself on the walls of the Bodeguita de la Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars are still circulating in Havana, since the imported jigouli and fiats have long since been in such a salty, wet, rotten climate.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly decrepit, nowhere else in the area there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has the green light.
Over the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had returned from the extensive plantations in the sugar mills on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how we can see small locomotives running there, whose contemporaries are not only in museums elsewhere.
Where do you go to direct your steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most famous places.
So there is no need to write long on Varadero or on Havana.
Otherwise remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Vinales Valley to the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
An exuberant vegetation grows there on a calcareous soil.
Mogotes, calcareous balloons and rocks rise in a chandelier from the bottom of the valley, and, since the fertile land has taken over their entrails, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is the place where you probably grow the best quality Cuban tobacco.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Someone might also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was filmed.
Trinidad (country)
Old town founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It is the slave trade and that of sugar that brought him glory and wealth.
The richness was embodied in the beauty and the character of this small-sized city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed over the course of four centuries.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain massif, is a place so far apart that in the 50's of the last century, there was no road that would link this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stand aside.
Nothing was being built, and that’s why nothing was being demolished either, everyone was content to have a roof over their heads.
If in Trinidad one has more time than an afternoon, then it is worth going to see also interesting places in the area, such as Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n beach or the Sucreries valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica which animates after sunset and where the music only fades in the morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this town located in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This view is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads that lead from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross an almost unmarked landscape of human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed the Eastern corner of Cuba, thanks to its unspoiled landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in fact, she was born about a hundred years after the journey of Colomb) and from the hill where stands the old castle and the current hotel El Castillo, we see several mountains, the most of which is the table.
About the coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain massif, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the descendants of the ancients
Only, as they say, is better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, say the Americans
The lack of soldiers and necessary equipment, according to the United States, affects the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the years to come.
The mission in Afghanistan is not taking place as it should, the representatives of the countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing opposition from the Taliban movement, the eight States involved today are also discussing future plans and the coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week, through Defense Minister Robert Gates, has called NATO troops into greater activity, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the Afghan government’s authority and the intensification of development aid.
“Evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other being to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Eighty-nine percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to data from the US military, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, to 60 per cent in the southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of them in the southern part.
But, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In concrete terms, they are requesting other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan troops.
“We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about eighty percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that lasted three days.
Who is Passive
In recent months, there have also been conflicts over the issue between the countries involved if all the allies are actually doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat requirements they are subject to are not as rigorous as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate,” Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers lazy.
“Afghan thugs discovered: Germans play, while ours fight,” Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went on to counterattack by publishing a photo of a British squad during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The state debt will rise to one trillion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding 84,000 kroner is the responsibility of each Czech Republic.
The total debt rose, at the end of September, to CZK 842.7 billion.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
Thanks to a better-than-expected change in the state budget, the Ministry has reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic rose by the end of September to CZK 842.7 billion.
During the nine months of this year it has increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
As of June, it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on state debt from the beginning of October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns is the responsibility of each Czech Republic.
During the past year, the state has borrowed more than 111 billion crowns.
"For now, it seems that, thanks to a less significant deficit planned for next year, we could exceed the limit of one trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and 1 trillion crowns,” Patria Finance analyst David Marek told the iHNed.cz server.
Next Finance analyst Vladimir Pikor’s forecast is similar: “We could exceed the trillion by the end of 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene was changing, that policies were willing to save more, the date could be pushed back to 2010.
But I don’t expect that change,” he said.
The Debts Are Crossing
The debt of the state is constituted by the debts of the central government and is generated mainly by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The government debt is financed by treasury bonds, rent securities, direct loans or, for example, loans to the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic debt has so far increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's external debt has increased this year for the moment from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The debt of the so-called negotiable state reached NOK 803.3 billion at the end of September and as of June it decreased by NOK 13.7 billion.
The average requirement for the state debt was 6.5 years.
“Total debt has increased annually from the first to the third semester by 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a much too high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by the rent securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It’s bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, it indicates that there will be material to negotiate when retirement reform comes,” Pikora said.
Better than what we expected
It follows from the government's 2007 financing and debt management strategy that the government had planned to borrow NOK 159.2 billion this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a better-than-expected change in state budget savings, the ministry reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum is essentially constituted by the deficit of the state budget, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the originally planned 91.3 billion crowns.
Then, these are the maximum sources foreseen for the Czech Consolidation Agency, i.e. 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state pensions for 43 billion crowns and the repayments of loans from European loans.
She compared today in court in Khartoum for naming a plush bear
The British teacher convicted of insulting Islam in Sudan was sentenced on Thursday night by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and eviction, his lawyer said.
Britain was accused of letting students aged 6 to 7 give the name of Muhammad to a stuffed bear while any depiction of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was liable to a penalty of whiplash.
The 54-year-old British schoolgirl from Khartoum Unit High School in Sudan was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with assaulting Islam and sedition under section 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of child molestation.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asked her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the class plush bear.
“Huit names come out of the mouths of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the bear photo followed by the legend “My name is Mohamed”.
The bear itself bore no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, “I’m just sorry that she asked the children to vote for him in a name.”
Opinion shared by many students of the teacher who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never speaks of religion in class".
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Great Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians concluded a sixth and final session of discussions in Baden, Austria on Wednesday morning without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
“It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status,” European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Noting that peace in the region was "at stake", his US counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“We do not foresee violence immediately, but we are entering a very difficult period,” he added, referring to “obvious tensions.”
End of Mediation on December 10
The troika mediators, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The province’s 90%-populated future could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko deliver their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The Baden talks, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was charged with a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council from granting independence to Kosovo, are insisting on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Is it a unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, the West believes that EU-supervised independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina says she is ready to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in her favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," Kosovo Autonomous Authority President Fatmir Sejdiu said at the hotel in Baden, where these "last chance negotiations" took place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “belonged to a past that led to murder and deportation.”
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still conceivable, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade says in particular to fear a “domino effect” in a region still weakened by the 1990s independence wars.
“For Serbia,” he said, “it does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision be returned exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto.
"Kosovo's parliament will have the last word"
“Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: at the Security Council.”
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of Albanians would be made "in consultation" with the West.
Bush pulls out agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately engage in negotiations to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructures” and Israel must put an end to its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides’ obligations to the “road map” for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim “to conclude a peace treaty that resolves all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues.”
This designation covers the three thorny issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be “global and in-depth” and deal with all aspects of a settlement, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others.”
In turn, Olmert pledged that future talks would be "direct and continuous" and that "an effort would be made to lock them in the 2008 stream".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for implementing his co-existing Palestinian and Israeli “two-state vision.”
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in this direction from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the origin of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in an interview with the Saudi Arabian daily newspaper.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As every time in this type of miscellaneous fact, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police Inspectorate's (IGPN) investigation, a police car was circulating Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., Rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
“She was not in intervention but on patrol, and was driving at 40-50 km/h, without gyrohare,” a police source said.
A Kawazaki-branded green bike, “unapproved, therefore not allowed to travel on the public road” (see below) and driven by two helmetless young people, was “very lively”.
“She hit the police car on her left, after a priority refusal on the right,” a police officer said.
The control of alcoholism performed on the occupants of the vehicle proved to be negative.
The condition of the car (front collapsed, windshield stellar, bumper torn off) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>re de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for “involuntary homicide and no-person assistance in danger” to the IGPN, co-operation with the departmental management of the Valété du public safety.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor specified that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, disclaimed the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday night, confirmed “the version of the police, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left.”
Yesterday, a sort of groove, probably caused by the rubbing of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained stuck as long as the police car managed to brake.
Vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after that?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly in Villiers-le-Bel, that the police would have left the premises very quickly, thus not lending aid to the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out “any serious fault” on this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, on which one must be very careful," a police source said.
Liberation met an eyewitness of those few moments that followed the accident.
One of its windows giving precisely on the scene.
“We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to get them to be weaned,” the witness said.
There was nothing to do.”
He then saw “a completely haard policeman, who was barking.
Two others were trying to revive one of the youth, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, apparently, with the certainty that the people present in the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to the witness, the rescues arrived “about twenty minutes after the police left.”
They also performed heart massages, in vain.
“I will not let it be said that the police did not assist the young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firemen arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday repressed the first demonstrations since the state of emergency was established two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the emergency measures were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter responded by throwing stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been arrested.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers charged and injured lawyers.
Several would have been called in.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyers’ movement gathered on Monday the support of religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president “has urged the people to send flowers to judges who have spoken out against the state of emergency and debris to those who have sworn in front of Mushara.”
"Musharraf's promise no longer holds"
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly affected by the measure of exception proclaimed Saturday evening.
It was due to decide in the coming days on the legality of the re-election to the presidency on October 6, with the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was evicted and replaced.
“Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president “holds no more” after the state of emergency was established, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
The resignation of his military uniform was expected by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf was reportedly assigned to residence by his deputy head of the army.
More than one-third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) are not planned, according to a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), 40 years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
However, the liberalization of contraception has allowed for a better ‘fertility control’, according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 years has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated monthly for a couple out of five and if possible in the spring, season considered the most enjoyable to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It would have taken more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his International Space Station (ISS) crewmates to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, which is essential for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky output that has amassed the records due to its duration, its removal from habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools “bricolated” by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem emerged on Tuesday as the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a large cylindrical room soon to host the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of mooring dock for laboratory modules.
However, they must be supplied with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a 17.5-ton solar panel power production module, already present on the ISS, to put it in place at its final position.
After moving it, the crew began redeploying the solar panels of the module, which have a size of 76 meters.
And it was there that one of the panels, which unfolded like accordions, was damaged on almost a meter by a cable that stuck.
Deployment has been stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally to carry out a check-out of the Discovery shuttle, then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go to the end of the 30-meter long remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (space walker) of NASA.
Large, resistant, very adroit, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor was therefore tasked with “operating” the “injured” solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he cut off the faulty cable and installed sorts of “attempts” on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" standing near the sas and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew's commander.
The tool he used, an insulator-encased mini-hockey can to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "bricked" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of his tools and returning the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts do not return the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS Title Sanctioned on the Stock Exchange
The EADS stock is currently in sharp decline on the Paris stock exchange, after the aeronautical and defense group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with delays in the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to revise its 2007 operating result forecast following delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which condition the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost to offset the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros including more than 1 billion for Airbus," the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating profit and loss targets (EBITs) for 2007 when it presents its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further numeric details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS operating income fell by 86 per cent in 2006, mainly due to charges related to delays in another program, that of the very large A380 carrier.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspension on Sunday at the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very locked-up campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends a televised message to voters on public channels, already registered but the contents of which are kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is announced overwhelmingly.
Yesterday, the president didn’t let anything go by receiving foreign ambassadors, merely delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference – its theme of preference during the campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and we want fair, transparent and open elections, unhindered elections,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from counting.
She's calling for a campaign of pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov said there had never been “such a dirty election, even in the time of Eltsine.”
After the repression of last weekend’s protests, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsuspended legislations are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election on March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
But no successor will emerge.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and of the all-powerful united Russian party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, both the legislature and the presidential, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the mentality of the Soviet homo, they do not feel masters of their fate,” says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, goes further: civil society has slowed down in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin re-established with the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population all the more so that this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease,” says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians are "fully giving up personal responsibility", which they had briefly shown after the breakup of the USSR.
“What’s good to think about?”
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of United Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinions prefer stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor, concludes: “What good to think about?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million records stored on 27 km of the line in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were only available for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of an ex-victim or his right-holders.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, and the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive Information
Historians’ access to Bad Arolsen will allow research to be conducted “in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health of forced workers,” says Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the public opening of these nomination documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the civilians deported or subjected to forced labour and, if necessary, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees handle tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t in Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade is already reaching almost 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In April, EU foreign ministers gave their green light to the European Commission to enter into negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the EU, according to figures from the European Commission.
“A free trade pact will do a lot for both economies” and “India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,” said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants trade annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services", said the European Commission's chief executive, Daniele Smadja.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday it was concerned to ease the current return of concerns over credit conditions, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion offer at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an unusually long offer.
"To alleviate the concerns that the conditions of the financial market will be particularly tightened at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its reserves during the planned period.
The bank says 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is the first time that BoE appears to be putting five-week liquidity on the market in an open market operation.
These are usually done within a week.
The BoE added in its statement that it "stands ready to take other measures to maintain rates" of interbank loans per day online with its base rate.
The interbank rate per day on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month rate has risen to 6.6%, a higher rate since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England had been accompanied by a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from using them.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the price of the book against the euro, many preferred to subscribe to the amounts put on the market by the European Central Bank, at more favourable rates and with more discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to consider PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups on Thursday refused to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (seat at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text rejected a dozen measures adopted Tuesday by the PS's national office, including a 50% increase in the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TPP, a cheque-transportation or cadre.
UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was adjourned following the general discussion that gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between the majority and the opposition a few hours after Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS deputy leader Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the entirety of his proposals in the form of amendments to the Bill on Correctional Finance reviewed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is coming
Following many rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with someone who has inspired the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is scheduled to take place from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as the “most inspiring event” he has ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we got caught up in politics because of the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to talk to Melvin Benn and we are getting ready to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after having stood out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals are held in an urban setting.
“The European model of Melvin Benn is a field festival, while ours take place rather in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a rural festival to the European and urban to the American.
Vineland is approximately halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, is excited to support this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states “that they are interesting enough to allow to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life.”
Charlie Jones says the festival’s reception capacity is “very large,” like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
“Vineland will taste like rock, but the music will be varied, in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal to face Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood film audiences to Montreal when no one but Terminator is opposed to it.
This seduction mission is one of the functions of a delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it hard to play in the hands of the Governor?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones that they will judge the best,” he says.
The Festival Race
At the moment, however, Denis Turcotte’s priority is to promote cinema here.
The Oscars race has begun.
It will be of all the festivals of the West Coast, whether it be Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, the issue of presenting Quebec films, highlighting them and making sure the directors do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec has also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? The experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks before the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands in hopes of the arrival of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year experts are not as sure as this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market generally has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts based solely on statistics should not be made, since given the current context, uncertainties remain in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not supporters of the stock market taking off during the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market feeds on the existence of liquidity, willing to invest due to the lack of long-term alternatives with guarantees, especially in terms of fixed income, affected by the value of the stock.
For this, they believe the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not free of volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates, given the high level of gross and the danger of stimulating inflationist tensions."
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
“That’s not the best thing,” the expert says.
Ibex, the Spanish stock index, has lost nearly 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Intermoney analyst Juan Solana believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of the portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during those dates.
However, the expert notes that things will be a little different this year as he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the Constitution Day Bridge (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, said: “We are close to the technical levels and that is why we could observe a rebound in the index that could be caused based on the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the credit market crisis.”
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for driving Ibex to new maximum odds.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that “this year the great values are back for him.”
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and a few manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, said the increase will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they get into it.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other manufacturers such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” he said.
The cyclical consumption will play a major role in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do it as well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the past seven years, only for two occasions in December has been a poor month.
The authentic end-of-year rally took place in 2003, during which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the breakthrough of the technological bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (for now, Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds at computer on its end-of-year rally.
The Popular Bank will open 200 offices open 12 hours Monday to Saturday
The People’s Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 pm, and to open on Saturday from 10 am to 8:30 pm.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the Popular Bank will be decisive for other organizations to join or not to join this initiative that coincides with business hours.
This is exactly what the People’s Bank is looking for.
Attract the autonomous customers that circulate in these areas to make their purchases in the SME and street shops chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies located across Spain in about 18 months, since it is not about opening new agencies but about renovating those already existing ones.
To do this, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the shopping areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design from the interior of the branch and a new design, more modern, with brighter colors.
The bank’s chief commercial officer, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, says the renovation does not involve large investments, but hiring staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The People’s Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a de Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and with success apparently, according to Rivero.
The People’s Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others that operate under the Mundocredit brand, specializing in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which open even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where many of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
"We don't want to compete with our customers," Rivero said.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica to sell mobile phones, with external staff at the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the stock value of its rival Antena 3
We got there.
With this sentence, Paolo Vasile, a delegate of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday, at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
“The only thing that made me sad was that it wasn’t the fact that we increased more but that we decreased less,” he said.
However, he stressed that on a low market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a 2.54% increase.
This gain stabilizes its loss to 15.66% over the past year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reached 4,488,88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which gave up 1.52% yesterday and which has accumulated a 40.5% drop since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies on the Stock Exchange is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1,779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it out in terms of audience."
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first TV channel this year to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenue, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the subsidiary that manages the group’s advertising.
In order for this announced data to be real, the TV channel is expected to record a 3.6% increase in its bill for advertising for the current fiscal year compared to the 965.4 million for the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, the net billing of Antenne 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the fiscal year (up to 734.4 million) while the net revenue of TV increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for Telecinco’s best relative evolution on the stock exchange is the significant pay-out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
" We have the official compromise to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those we have already given titles with the 33% of Endemol."
According to analysts, the market is currently giving signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its earnings estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to a decrease in projected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company decreased Antenne's earnings forecast from 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and to 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves transposition of the Mifid, which came into force on November 1.
In addition to its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by MPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of organizations for the effective functioning of markets.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, as it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial consulting services for specialized social reasons as well as for natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (FIs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems to the regulated secondary markets, which face competition from current exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment services companies to disclose information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management on the market, and obliges them to keep a record of all operations they carry out, to facilitate control on the part of the CNMV.
A number of changes have been added through the Congressional Economic Commission, one of which highlights that securitized debt will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has proven itself with what happened with the debt of high-risk U.S. mortgages.
In addition, they took advantage of the transition of management has taken advantage of to legally delineate the functions that graduates in Economics may have 30 years after 1977, the royal decree that delineates the professional functions reserved for economists was approved.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to lend its product marketing services and attract new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The Harmonized Consumer Price Index increases by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which subsequently serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance on price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication complies with Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policy by providing comparable data over time and in quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same method as the one used for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be revealed on 14 December.
"IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice president and economy minister, Pedro Solbes, said the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November was a "time figure" but at the same time predicted that the price index would continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes said in the run-up to the Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential about the monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
“We were hoping for a figure of around 4%,” the Minister of Economy acknowledged compared to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42,000 million over three years with Northern Rock
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,800 million) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, it was amassing some record deposits above <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a figure that has gradually fallen in two-and-a-half months due to the mistrust of its clients and despite the 100% guarantee of that money that the Government has offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the organization with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues of British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get those remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18,000 million until reaching the target of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 million.
The tycoon group Richard Branson, known for his advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the offer of the Virgin association, which is attended by three other companies, including its favorite to save it from bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for an alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (the People's Party) earlier this morning because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo replaced the current right-wing MP Juan Morales last May, and until then municipal councilor of the town hall, and who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER chain, could be the 'minor' of this plot.
The officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urbanism Council and the possibility of new stops is not ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales’ lawyer, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, was charged.
As indicated yesterday by the SER chain to the lawyer of the deputy of the 'popular party' Juan Morales, he was arrested when leaving Morales's home with important documentation in his possession relating to the plot.
In addition, according to sources of the investigation, the object of the investigation is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
So far, eight people have been arrested.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party’s bid for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win the elections
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, to be the leader of the Spanish Socialist Party’s list for Toledo for the next general election and to be president of the Congress in the event that the Socialists are elected.
So the organizing secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal seat of that party with Zapatero.
The chief executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician of La Mancha will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside over Congress if the socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n as President of the Congress, who last November made public his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the academic context.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he noted that while citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or shouting" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems regrettable that the only local in Madrid where one cannot speak calmly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate has been interrupted 26 times on certain occasions."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n and "his know-how to do" and he did not want to do as if he was already in his position to not fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might consider "a domination".
A Climate Propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to merciless persecution, both the skeptics of its predictions and those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate an iron consistency.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a “new contract for the planet”.
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has contributed decisively to Spain being at the head of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Those responsible for non-execution, in what sectors it has occurred and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be forced us to do, what economic consequences will it cause.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has been and there will be no explanation.
This is precisely because it is about self-sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Until the hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party, it seemed so dangerous to Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With phrases that have an impact, committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not demand, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not claim that we move on a bicycle or cool off with the range.
Totana mayor and local police chief arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Hall and a hotel entrepreneur suspected of possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation reported today.
The municipal councilor was arrested at his home and taken to the town hall, where at this time many agents met, who also presented themselves to the Municipal Councillor of Urbanism and to the municipal management company of the Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three stops are in addition to the six stops carried out last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the redevelopment of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 dwellings, during the last payment of rents.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Tribunal No. 1 of Totana instructs.
The first six inmates have now been transferred to judicial custody.
According to sources, Totana’s previous municipal councillor and currently the PP’s autonomous parliamentary leader, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the former wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancé of the former municipal councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, lawyer and entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigr<0xC3><0xA1>n (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Souelo de Inmonuar, Nuaria Group agency, and through which the wine cellars would have been realized.
The investigation was carried out by the Group of Urban Crimes of the Central Operative Unit (UCO) of the Gendarmerie, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, and Las Roza.
A single person was therefore arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, which could have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with “spa”.
The company has acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that have been rehabilitated and its project is expected to double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deals with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks in the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico square; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with the comment from yesterday in Finland’s most important newspaper (certainly at the head of PISA information above the educational level in the world), the Helsinki Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that it appeared there: black-and-white, curiously.

A colleague passes the information on the introduction to the Penal Code of Offences on Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a punishable offence of a six-month to one-year sentence.
On the other hand, the theft in a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros is considered only as a fault (Article 623.1).
B. The theft in a store for a value of up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is less than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than that imposed for downloading (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the trafficking of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous battle involves a three-month to one-year sentence (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would involve a six-month to two-year sentence.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unlicensed films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the truth then someone is exaggerating.

My treating doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
That is to say, the feelings generated by workers’ monthly pay depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted through tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the neurocognition imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed."
The researchers observed that when the two people assumed they were receiving the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them was receiving double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion would require so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has relentlessly pursued the war criminals of the Balkans since the public ministry of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbosnio leader Radovan Karadzic are still at large.
Their names are in this list of which the Swiss director Marcel Sch<0xC3><0xBC>pbach’s documentary takes its title, ‘Carla’s List’ (2006, not projected exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor in Belgrade in New York who is prosecuting the fugitive and government criminals.
What insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible harms, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, driving licence age, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use that is actually made, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And that is, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is realized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium awarded and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay the compensation in case of a claim.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established by taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, driving licence age, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured, or actual use, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on the statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the rate to be paid.
That’s why people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower rate of harm than their caution.
Similarly, by using censuses, the companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the probability of having an accident.
By increasing the frequency, the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
It is for this reason that the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 must face various drawbacks when entering into a contract with an insurance at an affordable price, such as poor driving experience and old-age driving license.
While the ideal to be well insured is risk-free insurance, there are other more economical options.
The most predictable drivers can opt for any risk insurance with franchise, so that they get insurance coverage at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
“The part of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be determined based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount will be,” said Luis Noguera, the Spanish head of First Europe, an online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but for those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under the age of 25 try to be careful and avoid claims as far as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the base rate owned by the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profits.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses,” Noguera explained.
Over the age of 25 it becomes easier for drivers to contract with insurance, as the rate of claims is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is better to choose any risk insurance with franchise.
“Normally, young people cannot benefit from the experience previously gained after an accident,” says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the ‘fear of the novice’ has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children it is better that he negotiates insurance at any risk, as long as his economic situation allows him.
Child marriages are considered by insurers to be the people with the lowest rate of claims, because the increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be any risk insurance with franchise (can be 300 euros), or extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of credit.
“They have a more relaxed drive and they have a greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchisees,” says Luis Noguera.
For retirees an insurance at any risk with franchise is preferable (being this one of 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of credit.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible harms, but also because it represents an important expense, that is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us most depending on our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth of the final
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are measuring themselves next Tuesday in San Siro to look for the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the Champions League, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians totaled ten points and they already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a zero match in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to make sure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC is scheduled to play the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on December 13 this month in search of a place for the final on December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the zero match at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to come out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning the final he will be the first and will be the last to win.
A defeat by Gordon Strachan’s team could be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn’t win, but she won’t be able to computer just about that because with nine points the game goes back to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but who won (2-0) in the other direction.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening with the Scots, who have good hope of qualifying for the eighth final for the second time in the Champions League, having been beaten during the last edition by a Kaka goal during the extensions (1-0).
While waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, in case Celtic would lose, to qualify for the eighth final in order to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without the possibility of continuing the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 People Attend Vancouver’s First Spice Girls Tour Concert
The Spice Girls have started their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators since the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) announced shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting is "starting".
Around 20,000 people have run out of tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video that tells the story of the band that went mad in the late 1990s.
The meeting and world tour coincide with the release of a new album that resumes their major hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls were staged by showing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' had offered them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience that filled GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Before the start of the show, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice', which was part of the group in 1998 "due to differences between us" and which caused the group to dissolve two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw that people’s feelings have changed, the feelings for the Spice Girls have changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said of the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have settled and we appreciate each other very much."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girl last showed up in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of baby sit waiting for them.
They have five sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7).
They will be exhibiting in Madrid on December 23.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine sets off the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia ferments, thereby increasing the risk of repercussions on the export of fuel to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are carried by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to U.S. countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia’s gas-supplied monopoly company, unsuccessfully tried to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase its prices in Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50 percent more for gas supplies from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would include for Ukraine, a 40% increase in import costs from Gazprom.
“It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, reminding us that we are a country through which most of the gas transits,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters.
“The fluctuation in gas costs would probably be related to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.”
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006, the disruption of Gazprom supplies destined for Ukraine.
This has led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, resulting in an increase in prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supplies.
Russia has the largest stockpiles of gas, although most of them are still under development.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve controls on its extra-Community employees to check whether they have criminal precedents, the supervisory committee said.
The General Reviewer's warning, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland, was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health did not have any specific data on the number of overseas people he employed.
However, its report highlighted other decisive controls, properly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General carried out checks on extra-Community personnel following the attack at Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Adullah, a 28-year-old Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after darkening with his jeep in the gates of the main terminal.
He was among the three doctors who were filmed at Old Bailey in October, as they were suspected of being involved in various attempts to blow up cars in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will need to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas personnel, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out previous criminal checks, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office for the Control of Criminal precedents, thus enabling employers to undertake controls over various countries.
“While we have found that some information about the staff has been properly verified, this is not done every time,” the report states.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks he would do himself, but he also added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas personnel is available to health services.
Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls could identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
"The report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
The Scottish health authorities said they employed 1,161 overseas people, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor General pointed out that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, in part because of problems with the identification of staff members with indefinite term contracts, who might or might not choose to stay in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures for checks by health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its pre-employment policy and control system for staff members outside the ocean of the health service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work as a result of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, allied with the Health Committees, would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report, which is expected to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment checks, and valid for all employees, including people.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the bio-pic about Joy Division’s last singer, Ian Curts, won five awards, including the best film, at the British Independent Film Oscars.
The trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was cast as Curtis in this film directed by Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Judi Dench was named best actress for her role in the thriller "Notes on a Scandale"
Daniel Craig, the Bond star, won the Variety Award for enabling British film to be under international spotlight.
The awards were distributed during the ceremony at London's Round House.
Control relates Curtis' rise to success with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, aged 23.
The black and white film whose soundtrack was made by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot on a budget of just 3 million Sterling.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, won two awards, the first as the best director on stage and the second as the best director on the starting stage.
The Rock was also awarded with the Best Documentary Award for Julien Temple's film on Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The best actor award was given to Viggo Mortensen for his portrayal of the driver of a Russian mafia boss, in the London-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, best known for his portrayals of a Korean character, won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old director, who has shot films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award in honor of star Harris, starring in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to cinema,” he said.
"I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."
“I was admirable in front of this great actor today, I was extremely honored.”
The Oscars for the independent film, better known as the Bifas, are awarded by a jury of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Fans and bosses at Bifa include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Blocks 208 Terrifying Plots
Saudi Arabia said yesterday it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells handling an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clerics and armed forces.
The state television of the world’s largest oil exporter said it was one of the missile smugglers’ cells.
Al Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against the allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 troops to protect the sites, following a failed Al Qaeda attack in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper, citing a statement by the interior minister, said 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a “missile launch expert” who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 people among the inmates appear to have conspired to murder ecclesiastics and armed forces.
The government has asked clerics to do more against the Iraqi-led Saudis, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and against the US-allied Shiite Muslim government, considered heretical according to the Sunni Saudi hardline.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiastics have collaborated with the authorities to support the government-dominated royal family policy.
The activists, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government, by Osama Bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
“Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces in the last five months,” the interior minister’s spokesman told state television.
Among the detainees, there are 16 members of the Medina organized in a "media cell" to promote "takfiri thought", the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 people are accused of subsidizing the militants.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus might have had conditions similar to those of Earth, and might even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation allied to slower rotation led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is devoid of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and light storms and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt the lead there.
The findings of Venus Express, the European Space Agency’s probe, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the Earth’s potential future due to catastrophic climate change.
University of Oxford physics professor Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
“Our new data allow us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, maybe even with a habitable surface.”
Enriched uranium seized by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently from uranium, was seized by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people were arrested and the equipment is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was good for uranium, but revealed that the goods would have a value of $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to date as a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates have finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who have registered their questions submit them to candidates.
On Wednesday night, November 28, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as that of another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats for their position on warming the planet.
But this time around, the questions and answers reflected a lot of the Republican party’s conditions, which were candidates for the next election.
It is not known on what criteria, CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the You Tube clips to show to aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest addressing of a single theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strongest topics for Republicans.
CNN has asked some voters to make a phone call when they hear pleasant things: The administration has seen increases in approval when the candidates are speaking out rudely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is leading the important early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of employing clandestine immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became particularly ferocious when they were asked if they would be willing to promote “amnesia” (giving the clandestines regular status and the possibility of becoming citizens).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to deepen this topic.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps thanks to the fact that they started fighting immigration before and in a more incisive way than the others.
In general, candidates, at least regarding immigration, have the same views: stricter borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, allied with concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys made in China, or other fears about the external world, encourages Republicans to forget, or to minimize, the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate has become particularly embarrassing when other topics have been raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the gun control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether to put water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates fully believed in the content of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not about to believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another interlocutor asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
We did not expect to see Mike Huckabee – in a pole position in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – declaring that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he began to laugh and said that Jesus was too chic to run for election.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee's upswing in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious grant searches conducted by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistleblowers during Wednesday's debate.
These two have emerged from the abyss, thanks to the fact that the two party protégés fail to agree on who is the best-known and most traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party in good time and convincingly thanks to a message of success on American greatness bringing the leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of the Worker
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to darken; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this one is not particularly judicious.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no finger extra juicy conjugal foot.
But there is a revelation that a wealthy businessman would have hidden for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle of which Gordon Brown would have gone well.
Two months ago, the prime minister backtracked on his draft election, foolishly insulting British intelligence by proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The repurchase of Northern Rock, a struggling bank on the verge of crack, has demonstrated a lack of guidelines and a poor judgment in case of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative bust.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against military spending cuts: they proclaimed that being a defense minister is for them a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of false donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of the Workers (and his former chief of surveillance) have made that they had to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is heading infallibly towards the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don’t like politicians, and they don’t trust them, but they usually leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even rule for a long time, when there is a risk of suspension: the public administration is no longer working; the cabinets of ministers are making the check; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and without any more goals.
In one sense, Mr. Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his superior lieutenant.
The problems related to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions made when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he’s not directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes, such as the long-running investigation into the party’s “money-for-money” funds for members of the House of Lords, voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown is facing is not so tragic as it seems.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories party make him believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to realize the Stalinist tendencies of Mr. Brown always, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal over political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special character, who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the big political supporters are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who claimed to be aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, without knowing that it was illegal, would therefore have to be questioned, as would Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraiser who had spoken about dubious donations in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown is not involved: Nothing suggests that he was aware of these procedures, even though most of the payments made were made as a result of his arrival in government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has made half of it.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative failure, but did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on a thing he knows well, resorting to a committee of inquiry on this subject consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been tampered with, it's from the police.
In addition, there are many other things Mr. Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Public Standards of Life, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financial affairs of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to cooperate with the Tories, which could lead it to renounce its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to reconquer voters, and the only way to get a victory is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and solid skills.
Scams of cards.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see attracted swimmers, whistling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measure unrecoverable balance sheet shares or who are, more than 30 days after.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, in part because of the weakness of cardholders.
It's still too early to panic.
The costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the rate of insolvency of 3.89% in the third quarter is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A 2005 change of laws in the United States, concerning personal bankruptcy caused a sharp fall in the bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of records (and therefore insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions worsened.
In addition, the industry announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is strong enough despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the volume of emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct link of infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exists: consumers might prefer to increase their debt now that fair real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to cash flow than to the value of the asset, and therefore the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily lead to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to credit card issuers.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; as a result, credit card debt would become a priority to repay the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgage lenders and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of having a rapid resumption of the shares.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and reassess all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, the director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a consequent decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market are driving America into recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Be careful with the dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty in the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were to testify to their roles in relation to a fraud committed by Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first pleaded guilty to the seven charges of alleged collusion fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam in order to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They are due to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all pleaded guilty to having committed a fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC Group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous throughout Great Britain due to extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains a pending issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 made Fastow understand that he was the subject of the government's investigation into Enron's debacle.
The charges against the bankers, nicknamed the "Natwest three", claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the stage director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him call the bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had rated its interest in the subsidiary as zero, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper purchased the bank’s interest from the subsidiary for <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 as interest for this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in Enron's debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three Britons were released following the payment of a $1 million bail each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national corporation, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting fraud, could no longer hide his billions of debt or even propose his speculations as profitable.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of layoffs, over $60 billion in loss of market value and over $2 billion in loss for retirement plans.
Enron's founder Kenneth Lay and former President General Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the company's collapse.
Skilling has been sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were dropped because of his death from a heart attack last year.
Neither under, nor outside of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel autonomy to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“Even if no one really needs as many seats as this is more of a family-owned aircraft or for the president of a company.”
Mr. Firer was present at Gulfstream’s booth last Friday at the Millionaires’ Salon, a four-day consumer-incentive orgy, held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their booths, hoping to spark the interest of the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from yachts in jacuzzi to cars filled with diamonds such as 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was looking at a bright orange Porsche, displayed next to his stand.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest private jet market.”
“With an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas.”
“We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior fellow at the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the world’s largest spending.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another location in Moscow, a luxury industry conference allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the wealthy are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who total $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank reported that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweler.
She participated in the show for the first time with the Russian distributor, Le Groupe Bijoutier de Soho.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking in the living room on Sunday night, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, claim to be like their clients, millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Melle Yumatova, who grabbed her high-suit dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems to be primarily aimed at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to make the tail in the plugs to come up to a huge warehouse where are exposed Cadillac Escalades, platinum canifs, M<0xC3><0xB6>venpick ice cream, tables of billiards and customised duplets, apparel.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” said Mr. Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal Delf porcelain factory, in front of a wall painting of Raimbrant on blue tiles.
“The Russians are more interested in the bling bling.”
Indeed, the sellers have stated here that Russians with old capitals (10 to 15 years are too old according to Russian standards) have already switched from pop-up logos to a kind of limited-edition brand that could not be sold at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, millionaires, millionaires or tourists, go to the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he had sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and cotton mattresses encrusted with gold threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the director of sales of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with last-cry alarm systems, also said he sold to a Russian millionaire, the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalizes luxury cars, said he would sell three bracelet-like cars, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be encrusted with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of oatmeal leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconia, will not necessarily drive with such tires,” Karapetian said.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles.”
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term “Russian millionaire” is not on the agenda, given the increase in real estate prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if it’s not in cash,” he said.
“There’s more than you could think.”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the booth of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company has set up four booths representing British telephone booths, filled with mass counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passers-by arrested for throwing masses of tickets, asking their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or poking a few million.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karyev said.
Unaffiliated Surgeon Suspected of Homicide in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston was looking through the glass bay of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant and observing an ambulance that had just stopped at the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,” Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone had died.
Authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unapproved cosmetic surgeon, which the police have not yet identified, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Melle Arroyo's death, but they are waiting confidently, the results of toxicological tests that will unfortunately take time, but which should allow to solve this mysterious death that has attrited the high ranks of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been the assistant to the director of police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenacious,” McCarthy said of Melle Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
“It was like a pit bull.”
“She would have done anything to protect me.”
McCarthy said that Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she leaves two sons aged 14 and 11 as well as a daughter.
Eileen Walsj, spokesman for Union County Attorney General Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died from an unauthorized surgical operation.
“This is an opportunity to consider.”
“The investigation is continuing.”
Authorities said they arrived at her home around 3 p.m.
and found Melle arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and authorities have not said much about the investigation nor even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh was unable to confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are looking to understand if a part of the house was used as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Melle Castro's house where a fanned rosary rests in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked in the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two all-terrain bikes hung on the sides.
McCarthy said that since she arrived in Newark 25 years ago at the New York Police Department, Melle Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this,’” he said.
“She was there when I arrived, and again when I left.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce rates linked to the effervescent nature of the global stock market.
Stocks exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would try to calm credit conditions, later reducing interest rates promoted by the calming statements of the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
Stock markets explode in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, president of the Federal Reserve, said those who decide must be “flexible and pragmatic” in their actions in troubled financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure irritating markets due to these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence has partly “reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market late September and October.
If this harsh turbulence were to persist, it would increase the chances of a subsequent rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into U.S. markets, and that further declines in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also calm Wall Street with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial turmoil was accentuated as a result of Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will fire 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate for the heavy losses caused by the losing bets on real estate loans.
Only 20 jobs are planned in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55% to 13,289.40, while the largest index, the S&P 500, rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points or 2.7% closing at 6306.2 adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
In the past, the resurgence of credit difficulties in the markets has been highlighted by the strong demand for an auction of monthly sorting funds from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressures on the Bank of England to track the Fed and the ECB and inject further funds into London’s financial markets causing credit tensions have led to British banks’ monthly “Libor” borrowing rates rising 12 percent since September to a record high of 6 percent.
England is facing a call for judgment in relation to critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We face two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the No. 6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the selectors who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the President General Manager of England, began to fill out the application forms at a later date.
Whoever fails to win the No. 6 back will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is too.
It is never easy to annihilate what allows a man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach the lower level, sometimes by lack of luck more than by lack of skill.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is this the right time for Bopara to emerge?
Is it fair to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new graduates, professionals, should be promoted: but there is room for only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless he is given at least one chance?
The numbers have their importance in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a batsman must be lucky to touch the cricketer one day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison was in full shape and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors out of 33 laps to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
If it is Shah or Bopara who will play at the Asgiriya stadium, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man’s career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also struggled to emerge, who managed to become the Test's primary cricketer, and this, despite being his double-cent Australian yet again.
The probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today’s session at the Asgiriya stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and foster Shah’s greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start to the 88 Test innings in Bombay, 32 first-class cents against six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at launch.
But Shah did only ten laps during his two innings against the Caribbean in May during the Test at Lord, his Middlesex player town, and that, the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan is back in shape, claiming his place for the next match, seems to have strained his ebbs so obvious to Bo.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently capsized on a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, England's sponsor.
He reported only minor injuries, was shocked, though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at him from afar, to ask him if "he'd seen that?"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his spinning appearance allows him to do services that go to him, and that he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Could this be the true art of selection?
I would be inclined to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will play this weekend.
Buses bring people back to work, and to fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, pouring out those exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope the city has regained normalcy.
Some came back to fight against the militants who drove them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before Damascus’s arrival of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now.”
“They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!” he said, referring to the Shia militia of the clerical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to move away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned home with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S.-aided militia allowed him to hunt down Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited him back home.
One of Jordan’s newcomers is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home in northern Baghdad due to a grenade attack after he urged citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys.”
“That’s why I’m coming home today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been attracted by the growing calm of the capital since U.S. troops arrived, and to the prospect of continuing training well-armed “groups of citizens involved” and collaborating with U.S. military to defend their neighborhood.
But still others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, expressed the suspicion felt by all about the visas for exile that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, would have asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people are said to have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
“We didn’t have a problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” he said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house when I left.”
The drop in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis were driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
It is feared that a sudden influx of refugees will again increase sectarian tensions and bring fighting back.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federal state leads in terms of vocational training, and shines even by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-determination, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of the Saar, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
Up to now, students have the opportunity to complete their studies there with a double, or even a triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high proportion of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads the country’s children to higher than average schools – many of them without a Gymnasium degree.
“In Sarre, we benefit from the vocational training system,” says Axel Pl<0xC3><0xBC>nnecke, an expert in training at IW.
More than one in five young people obtain their degree in a vocational school, so the Saar is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are also relatively well developed.
Given the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That’s why the Sarrois Ministry of Education has forced higher education schools into a marketing campaign in engineering science.
“After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools,” said a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced comparative tests throughout the federated state.
For children to start learning earlier, the last year of nursery is exempt from the law - a model that other federal states copy as well.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether students’ performance improves in a sustainable way.
In PISA studies in 2003, the number of students at risk decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
In total, however, the Saar has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are better off.
And despite the sarrois, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise you could earn points in this field.
Because the language of the neighbor is mandatory in high schools - even if the sarrois are not French.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez adjusts the clocks
In Venezuela, the watches will soon do tic-tac differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will raise the half-hour timer in the South American country.
Chavez eventually became a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela reported, due to a new law, the watches will be set to less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chavez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with neighboring Colombia, due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist announced that while conservative Alvaro Uribe would remain president of Colombia, he would have no relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
“I can’t, just because of my dignity,” said Chavez, who is looking forward to a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chavez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe reportedly “cracked Venezuela’s face” with the decision, Chavez said Sunday.
In Spain, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is also in every mouth.
A new mobile phone ringtone is furious in the country: "Porc<0xC3><0xB3> no te callas" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the internet.
It was pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was annoyed by the constant interrogations of left-wing populists and who told him to shut up.
A fall in wages threatened Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, according to a forecast, a real undervalued wage threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-B<0xC3><0xB6>ckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
“The fault lies in the low wage development, the rise in value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices,” said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research, in the journal Bild.
New charges could also be applied to unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck told the newspaper Neue Osnabr<0xC3><0xBC>cker Zeitung that the projected decline in unemployment insurance of 3.3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, according to the words of the SPD politician.
We learned on Tuesday that the explosion in food and hydrocarbon prices had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices have increased by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like Earth than previously thought: the European space probe Venus Express has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind gusts at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lights on Venus.
The European "Venus Express" probe today brought evidence of this - it detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lights on Venus burst at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud clouds, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California at Los Angeles.
According to the famous theory of cypress, lightning would have made life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: “If there was life, it must have been at a very ancient date in history,” says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there should be little living things on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be the infernal twin of the Earth, but it remains a twin,” Russell said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like Earth in mass and dimensions, has been hit with such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venetian research, as no more probes were on the way for exploration of this planet since the 1980s.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" not only emphasize the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than assumed at first.
So the researchers found, in addition to the wind gusts already known at the north pole, a cloud gust at the south pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air currents in the Earth's hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet, known as a star in the evening or in the morning, revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much more slowly on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly resembles the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets were formed under similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth in the form of carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
K<0xC3><0xB6>hler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany K<0xC3><0xB6>hler calls for an end to the party dispute over the Dalai Lama's welcome to the Chancellery.
In an indirect way, he criticized the SPDs for the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst K<0xC3><0xB6>hler is concerned about the appearance of Germany and sums up the great coalition of closing the dispute over the welcome of the Dalai Lama.
“We must not present to the outside world a nation divided on this issue,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, K<0xC3><0xB6>hler showed understanding for the welcome of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for differences between cultures,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, the President of the Federal Republic stressed, but defended Merkel against the accusations that it would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional policy of a single China.
"China knows that too," K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the welcome of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this beyond the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained in particular about the CDU's "deployment policy" regarding foreign policy.
After welcoming the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only ordered German Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck (SPD), but also, according to Spiegel, frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is now demanding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize that the Dalai Lama’s welcome was a mistake.
China refuses European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in its official functions, Wen Jiabao thus backed the Chinese position.
The words and deeds of the Dalai Lama would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other present-day provinces.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fighting with police, shooting, cars on fire: Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be implemented so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not break out in the streets by violence, the German Interior Minister demanded.
Barricades that burn, breakers that shoot at the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not form in our homes as well and defuses into violence.
We need to take this seriously," he told the "New Press" in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federal states and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, it already shows its first successes."
But it would be too early for an end to the warning.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble points out at the same time as in German suburbs, there are no sociological problems either from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had fought serious street battles with the police over the past few nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned down.
With greater efforts to integrate the German government, this is what the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded.
Taking into account the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
However, there is still a need to act.
Kolat stresses the fact that the share of unemployed among young people under the age of 25 from immigration would be above average.
First of all, there should be more room for training.
Kolat insisted: “We must give young people a perspective.”
The President of the Turkish communities, however, added that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged, "But we must still be careful."
It should “live to give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training”.
In the meantime, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with projectors.
The authorities in the post have reported three arrests as well as a few burned cars and trash.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the borough.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the disturbances flooded in Toulouse.
The riots erupted after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The Utopian entry of the chancellor shows that the coalition has ended with the bottom - and that there is nothing more to expect from her.
In which country does this chancellor live?
After her unfortunate intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country that should, in the end, be governed by it.
The accusation of focusing too much on politics was repelled by Angela Merkel in a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said, and she just showed by that she doesn't want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, she made it clear to everyone how accurate this accusation was.
There was neither concrete interest nor sentiment in the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a heavy-handed politician, who flees into foreign politics and even there remains in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it congratulates again and again on the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate goals will have to be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of itself - having so little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it even two years ago.
Now it is cramped by formulas all made, that growth would affect people.
This is how she destroys her image as a pragmatist, who solves the problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy issues are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty in children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few additional sentences left for this.
In this regard, it is obvious how many times it makes lapses when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce a sentence in half precise.
She titulates in unknown terrain, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney commit themselves to a tough offensive battle – and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already breaking out on the first topic.
It would have made New York a “refugee for the clandestines,” Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
“I would say that his own house was a haven for clandestine people,” Giuliani said, blaming the former governor of Massachusetts for employing undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are on the attack: as the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users have sent via YouTube are barely more than fans.
“It is with this kind of isolationism that we have let Hitler come to power,” John McCain tells his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also taking the lesson vigorously by Vietnam’s veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called “Waterboarding,” a method of interrogation where one simulates drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign sometimes go beyond the war in Iraq and debates about torture is seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Common Room in Florida.
Whether conservative values are rented out or future tax increases are rejected, the applause flows into the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites are once again revealed.
“I made a mistake at that time,” Romney said, adding that he apologized to the base and the public for still being a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, enters a flowing node when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian life.
One day after his withdrawal as head of the army, the Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of domination by the army ends.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as head of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and had thus succumbed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his takeover by a bloodless putsch, the former general now reigns for the first time as a civilian head of state.
Through this withdrawal from the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on November 3.
Soon after his investment, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another requirement of the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, which Musharraf had held after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers from his ranks, rejected last week all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others wounded.
According to instructions from the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the border with Afghanistan.
Krautrock's parents are coming back.
Germany’s supergroups of the seventies rejoice: the three members of the Harmonia group again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return appeared recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The intended sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
It is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, 57, who owns a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, curves on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including even a beat.
And sometimes this adds inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves too much.
The fact that the Harmonia group plays again ensured a few emotions among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, of course, the name is rational in the collective memory of the pop, but in no way so durable that this group is also painfully lacking for 32 years.
But why wouldn’t the German also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the seventies?
All the more so than what is falsely called "Krautrock" has always been more prevalent in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, German pop faces were seen in the room questioning.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf and Neu! in the Pan-Greek praise, the surprise had no more limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the scene of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance in oneself and the transfiguration in the unknown is the only one.
The memory is of this fact already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during this period, the power of impact that felt was much lower than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We played first in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf, for a church-subsidised label, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly worked in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the forests of Weserbergland.
There, in a former Weser farm, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Commune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the manner of Spitzweg.
It is said that in the trash was a fanion of the choral Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
A lot of people keep Harmony away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
Because as serene and modest as the music sounded, the group suffered material misery.
The harvest of dead wood did not serve alone in the search for self.
The CD "Live 1974" that just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as well as someone believed to be remembered.
Rother issued at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and ensured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster revived itself in the 1980s and has since had more success than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe Griessem's live album to Herbert Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nemeyer.
His label Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as a German contribution inherent in contemporary music.
Neu! had already been buried on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of Krautrock's influence would be determined with regard to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s phrase hovers in the room amid the singular sounds: “The only true music, you listen to the future.”
There are photos that show producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
Projections of other black and white photos of bazaar wired tools serve to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and the battery, to shoot the instruments of the unique sounds thanks to the instruments with effects built by themselves.
Today, electronic music is similar to electronic music.
The three in great technical gnolls.
Even the choir of the house will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, one coughs and whispers under the cloud of sounds, and one sings at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
Roots have been less sought after in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the avoidance of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia is no longer annoyed by this now.
But what goes most of itself will be thoroughly covered on the stage.
Where does music start and where does it end?
It can tap on someone’s nerves (?) or give away fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderful Peace", two films re-arrange the Balkan War.
But the two are not convinced.
Either the projects rely too much on action and on the exchange of senseless shots or on the contrary they are too teary.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news is that the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is precisely there, in the saddest hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere was then found.
We had in the last place lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because too many kind and futile roles in women's sentimental films and too many press conferences on the topic of Buddhism delighted him with the desire to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch anyway "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why should today's films be as long and confused as collective conventions of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a magnificent representation full of eye-openers: in the end, his character as a war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and industry of the films were not so benevolent: a man who has had his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a monument to his ruin, has gone from his ruin to his ruin.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Suicide Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless follow-up of lost films on the Balkan War.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from the Kosovar snipers, in which one of them falls in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not presented as the only causes of all evils, this film as flat as a telefilm is lost too quickly in the action and the exchange of senseless shots.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with a war in place.
On the contrary, one can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party" why there has never really been a good movie about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioned to track the high war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, with another director and another writer (both at once Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories look strikingly similar: two males go on a small team in the forest, to accomplish something the military can’t do and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that one simply does not let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynical with a heart, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute to him a romantic adventure with a Bosniak murdered later.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, through an accelerated process, succeeds that NATO, the CIA and all the world's bounty hunters have not succeeded in five years: catch the villain for the sake of war, and there's no way to catch the villain.
It is so bad that the International Court of Justice of the Hague should be held against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) not to conduct the hunt quite intensively due to secret political agreements.
But the good intention and the bad are so similar this time that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compatious, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how it is tiresome to be evil."
Movies such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such thundering heads, but which hint at how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films about the Balkan War.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been any good films about South Africa.
What’s worth every time: when a star drags on a crisis home or a minefield, it then comes out something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arquette, “Jenseits gor Grenzen” with Angelina Jolie or “Blooddiamanten” with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
In any case, decades have still passed before Hollywood can shoot a good movie about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films still have to mature well - those that today use classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have in no way been celebrated unanimously at their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps today we know just as much about the conflicts of the world, where each hecatombe arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And this delighted the writers with the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The dictator" actually became as good as it was because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don’t want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps one should have the sarcastic and distant artistic look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It is only because some things never change."
"The big cities will always be terribly dangerous, the men will always be murdered in a horrible way and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust is critical of the cancellation of the Olympics.
The mayor's retreat with Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has been met in politics and economy with virulent criticism.
Many want to continue to fight for the Games on the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of opportunities.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday described an abandonment as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as many motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympiads.
“Without this goal, the political-sport momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures.”
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point in the longer term, "which takes another modified agenda as the starting point".
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday in his previous statements, according to which Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
“It’s not Hamburg that decides to run for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation,” Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the Sports Federation’s expected decision in early December, about Munich’s bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us that, in the time span we had planned until 2028, we will have no chance.”
However, the dream does not belong definitively to the past, said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now," HSB President G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Plo<0xC3><0x9F> said on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidature would be more in contradiction with the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the admission to the plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust reportedly described Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiades as "not a substitute" at the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Sports Higher Schools had first named Hamburg as the candidate city in the past weeks.
The mayor’s SPD faction blamed the Senate for not using this precious time in building housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grassbrook has been denied by the Senate for years because it played the map of the Olympiads and excluded the construction of housing," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded for the Little Grassbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event Factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg, for its part, would have raised a great enthusiasm.
Hamburg, however, had broken up against Leipzig.
They're not Warhol's safes.
The one who connects the concepts of Sweden and falls into wood, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or if?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol’s list of works.
A large part of the eighty Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxs of 1968 by Andy Warhol a few months ago, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm today resulted in a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes" from the "Brillo-Boxes", of which the "Brillo-Boxes" from the "Brillo-Boxes", the "Brillo-Boxes" from the "Brill", and the "Brillo-Boxes" from the same" are from the same.
The ancient history is interwoven, a disconcerting chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powdered soapboards.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These were not from Warhol (for financial reasons) but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art here, but rather their models, samples of exhibitions.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time today speak of about fifteen wooden boxes that at the time would have entered law into the history of art and auctions, as Andy Warhol's original Brillo-Boxes allowed, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached more than $100,000 in auction sales.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum wrongly claimed, later, that about one hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would then have given to him.
In fact, the 105 Hultén boxes were produced in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> only in 1990, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Bystr<0xC3><0xB6>m, curator in charge of the Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the museum’s six Brillo-Boxes, three other Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and polished with a brush, and then the appliqué.
On the contrary, the texture of the copies dating from 1990 reveals that the painting was applied directly without a layer of background on the laminated panels, using a paint roller - in addition, it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol's official Brillo-Boxes list," Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet, said: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York doesn't collect any of these, Moderna will collect any other decisions.
Already in July, the Authentication Board of course announced that it would investigate the "heavy accusations" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since then, there has been an inexorable silence.
The Rebel Soldiers of Manila Leave
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers abandon, the same ones who had retreated to a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not respond to any bloodshed.
The loyal soldiers in power had just before stormed the hotel using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been locked up in the building for hours.
About half of them stood before the courts on Wednesday due to a failed putsch attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly slump with about 30 supporters.
The military police officers, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently deserted in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal troops in power shielded the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People have enough,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who commanded before the Scouts Rangers elite unit, said other units in the army soon wanted to join the march.
Critics of the regime called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
Manila's financial district has been the scene of the attempted mutiny of some 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The uprising broke out almost 24 hours after the army refused to join it.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven putsch attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent of the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as reported by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 percent of the share capital would be held.
We've been speculating on a buy-back before.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step, we seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet reported.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its stake in the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would only hold the money for a third party, the market is reported.
Yesterday, United Internet had already acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed on the Stock Exchange 17.4 million new shares worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106.4 million.
United Internet bought it for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5.15 million for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31.1 million.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephony.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a United Internet spokesperson said.
The two companies founded the MSP holding company to absorb the competitor Freenet.
At the moment, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not make use of their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent at Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
The two companies would, however, be left open to all options, particularly to increase participation in SA Freenet, we learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
The still hard-to-predict poker on Freenet, which has been going on for months, is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers linked by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The United Internet and Drillisch Holding had a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01 per cent.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch would bring about four percent more.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment firm Vatas had already been decided in August.
