Welsh MPs don’t want to appear as “muppets”
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today as AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from across the political spectrum fear that this could lead to ridicule.
A Labour representative explained his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means "dusted", and pwp means "beautiful".
A representative for Wales party Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole was "dissatisfied" and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative for the Welsh section of the Conservative Party said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the pronunciation of the MWP is very close to the word "Muppet", which, in addition to being the name of some well-known dolls, is also a British slang word for "dust".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar manner as the letter U is pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like an "uh" sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: “Of course, it is the members themselves who have the final right of designation in terms of which name they are to be referred to.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly permission to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public hearing that showed general support for renaming the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the representatives, the Commission supported WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the alternative MWP received the most support during the public hearing.
Representatives are reportedly proposing other options, but getting all parties to come to an agreement could lead to a headache for Parliament President Elin Jones, who is scheduled to deliver a legislative draft of the name change over the next couple of weeks.
The legislation around the reform will include other changes in how the National Assembly works, including rules for disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the last right to vote on what to call them when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to decide if the country’s name should be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia will be able to vote on whether the name of their country will be changed to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbor is a requirement on their territory, and has on several occasions opposed the country’s applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to participate in the EU and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's stills – the crickets of Harlem are struggling
“The old people I spoke to have told me that before that time there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
“Now there are none of the parts.”
He said the bar's demise was understandable.
“People are socializing with each other in other ways,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local community, which everyone visits regularly.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe. “And sooner or later they will be back at the beginning.”
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who won’t help the neighborhood’s remaining resorts.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and will therefore only hasten the day when these churches must close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both wars were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A nearby black church took over the building.
St. Martin’s got a black church under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street – one of Harlem’s main shopping streets – because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused great damage to the building, and when Father Johnson's son-in-law made plans for the reconstruction, they bought into a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared the carillon to be "the church bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's has never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin’s over the past few months is a complicated interaction between architects and entrepreneurs, some of which are initiated by the church’s lay people’s leadership and others by the diocese.
The Council of Churches – the church’s leadership, made up of lay people – wrote to the diocese in July concerning its concern that the diocese would “try to impose costs” on the Council of Churches, despite the fact that the Council of Churches had not been involved in the inauguration of the architects or contractors sent to the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of openness on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he appeared for lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help, and that he and a group of others were swimming across to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he initially believed that the boy shouted out of enthusiasm over catching a lobster, but he gradually realized that the boy shouted 'I got bit!
I was bitten!”
His entire collarbone was torn up," says Hammel, who discovered the injury when he reached the boy.
“I called for everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is not known.
Swimmer Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles also said the victim was seriously injured in the upper torso.
Authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its revenue in the UK's beauty care market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-like makeup and beauty care shelves, staffed by specially trained staff.
The expanded shelves are being tested in 11 stores around the country as part of a strong entry into the UK’s 2.8 million beauty care market, which is experiencing steady growth while the sales figures for clothing and household items drop. If the attempt turns out to be successful, the concept will expand to several years.
The investment in beauty care is the result of the supermarket’s attempt to find a new area of use for the space that was previously used for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s has said it will double the number of beauty care products it offers to 3000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the store chain has never sold before.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get better space in noted brand areas, just like in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relaunches its Boutique make-up brand with mainly vegan products, because there is an increasing demand for this among younger customers.
The fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will also test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's stores, one opened in Croydon, South London last week, and the other opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
E-commerce and a new tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the sales will eventually look more and more like a department store, as the supermarket takes up the fight against the cheap stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods outside of food.
Sainsbury’s has placed Argos sales in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to upgrade its beauty care and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was settled after a dispute over the distribution of income from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281 stores to Celesio, owner of Lloyd’s Pharmacy, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We have transformed the look and design of beauty care shelves to create more welcoming environments for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will then be ready to provide advice and help.
Our brand selection is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting surroundings and convenient locations make us now a beauty care competitor that represents a new shopping experience.”
Peter Jones is ‘surprised’ after Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal worth GBP 11 million
Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones is reportedly furious after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an 11-million-dollar deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessories brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby, 37, who is the program manager for This Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons’ The Star Peter Jones by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand in the last second to focus on her own new gold-edged contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “surprised” at a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that the television’s gold medalist admitted that her new deals – worth up to GBP 1.5 million – mean she no longer has time to spare for their clothes, clothing and clothing.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop, and it was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK on his way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truthfully, it was undoubtedly Holly’s first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security over the next few decades.
Everyone is shocked that she has chosen to leave.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was just before the launch.
Now there is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters, which is now ready for sale.”
Experts believe that this morning’s programme manager, one of Britain’s most popular stars, could cost the company several million pounds due to major investments in products such as pillows and lights, fashion and cosplay, as well as a potential delay in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become brand ambassador for M&S and is to replace Ant McPartlin who hosts the ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We don’t want to comment on his business deals.”
Checkboxes "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for having made a comment some would consider "little presidential", and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much away?
Trump said in his imitation of a news anchor.
“I didn’t give anything away.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, after even declaring that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big mess on the road to nuclear disarmament by North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a “corresponding response” from the United States to its early disarmament measures.
He noted that the United States, instead, still has sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for an assembly of his voters.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a very good relationship.”
He said his work to improve Kim's relationship has yielded positive results, such as putting a stop to missile tests, helping to get hostages released and getting the remains after U.S. officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about Kim's relationship.
“It’s easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said.
Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami Hit an Island and Kill Hundreds of People
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-profit organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of Lombok's residents had lost their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for international aid to be sent in.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so it’s quite challenging,” explained Sumbang.
Save the children is now putting together a team to travel to Palu, but is not yet sure whether foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the national agency for crisis management, said Indonesian authorities are considering the situation in Palu to see if international organizations will be allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Considering the earthquakes Indonesia is constantly subjected to, the country is terribly ill-prepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Lying to protect against tsunamis is built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning siren on Palu, although a warning had been issued, has probably contributed to the death toll.
Even under the best circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquakes is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made an upgrade of Indonesia’s fall-proof infrastructure to a major point in his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on the road and railways.
But the lack of money has been a major problem for Joko’s administration, which is due to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have turned to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge with late equalisation in match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea on Saturday by scoring in the 89th minute of the game at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the Chelsea goal while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left foot before sending it to the longest corner.
The attempt went high above the box as the ball sank towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as well as it can be done, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touched the ball once and didn’t think too much about it and just kicked it further.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at the break, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker sent a pass with the heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before changing direction near the midfield and sprinting into the Liverpool half of the track.
Kovacic came up with a quick delivery on the midfield.
He then fired from a great breakthrough pass that brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the European Football League for men in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
Indonesia tsunami death toll reaches 832
The death toll from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country’s emergency management agency said on Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a 7.5-magnitude strike that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters, the agency’s spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho explained at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from razed buildings.
Police arrest a man (32) for murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation is underway after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with a stab wound at 7:55 in Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man has been arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything to contact.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan says: “We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I would like to ask anyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on their car camera, to contact them – they may have information that is critical to our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the deceased woman was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police have said they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was aimless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take several hours before they get back in.
A police officer was interrogated when he told a man that the whole area is now being treated as a place.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She repeats “it’s so horrible” over and over again.
At 2 p.m. two police cars were behind the barrier, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers were outside the barrier and had oversight of the apartment complex.
Individuals who have information are asked to send an instant message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, by referring to “log 247” from September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial drawn into the "rewrite history"
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatical Puritan supporters.
However, the Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick's publishing as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Westminster Palace would also become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s stunning depiction of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century’s opinions and is part of the historiography of a man many believe still deserves praise.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is being watched by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against pressure from outside – in his time it was, of course, about the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering.”
Death toll kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, referred only to by the surname "Yuan", was found dead and covered in blood from a ruptured pulsar near a binge on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to put vaccines on pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai province of China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered that the door to a nearby piggy bank was open.
He said that inside the pig's path there was a big madman with blood on his mouth.
A forensic study confirmed that the 250 kg pig had killed the man.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and maltreated," explained the cousin, referred to by the surname Wu, in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from the surveillance camera showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40pm on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While police gathered evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked inside to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Yuan’s family and market leadership are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Although it happens the skull is not the first time a pig has been recorded to have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on a farm in Massachusetts, and inflicted serious injuries on the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a 300 kg pig until the farmer's wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba explained to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to normal, but that the taste of blood can have a trigger effect.
“They just play.
They like to bite, and are very curious... they don’t try to hurt anyone.
You just have to show enough respect.”
Remains of Hurricane Rosa Will Lead to Heavy Rain in Southwestern U.S.
As reported, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cooler sea on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain on her journey through northern Mexico and southwestern USA over the next few days.
Rosa had a wind speed of 135 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northwards to the southwestern United States.
Pink will cause up to 25 cm of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction between tropical humidity and the approaching tremor will lead to widespread heavy rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, liquid debris and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates of up to 5–7 cm per hour in some areas, particularly areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5–10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
There are opportunities for flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert on foot as long as there is danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause river valleys to become wide-brimmed sparkling rivers, and the thunderstorm will lead to local gusts of wind that may contain dust and sand.
The approaching drought will result in local heavy rainfall for parts of the coast along Southern California.
Total rainfall above 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to liquid debris and rapid, as well as smooth roadways.
This will be the area's first rainfall of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rainforests will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and continue throughout Wednesday.
October can cause some intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder but the tropics remain very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of strong temperature differences throughout the central United States on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next couple of days, persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the Central and Eastern U.S. will likely have a warm start in October, with degrees high in the twentieth century from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast U.S.
New York City could reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that the eastern United States is most likely to have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, spread across six TV networks, saw Thursday’s gripping testimony from Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their usual broadcasts to announce Friday's big surprise at the last second, when it emerged that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had arranged for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh felt her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent sure this did not happen.
The broadcast on Friday was likely seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average viewership for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Seettal was not immediately available to other networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring office workers.
To give a bit of perspective, this is the viewer count that corresponds to the playoffs in the American Football Championship or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose critics have supported Kavanaugh’s appointment with great enthusiasm, led the way among the networks, with an average viewership of 5.69 million for the full-day poll, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was the main character in Friday’s drama.
On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras as he tried to take the elevator to a meeting of the court committee while protesters screamed and shouted at him.
He stood with his eyes lowered for several minutes as he was peeled out, while the incident was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to our country?”
He was told that “you have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake pointed out that his office has made a statement, saying the elevator doors closed that he would have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, when the court committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be passed to the entire Senate for voting.
But Flake said he was only willing to do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate within the next week, which the Democratic minority has called for.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's election had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of ‘political game’ around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused opponents of her plan to leave the EU to run “political games” with Britain’s future and undermine the nation’s interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, side by side with her own on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson has continued his attack on her so-called “Chequers” Brexit plan by saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs was “completely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of causing the LSU player's death
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) has been arrested and charged with intentional murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the basketball court.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, according to The Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish court physician released a preliminary report on Friday, stating the cause of death as a gunshot wound to the head and through the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police's task force for capturing refugees, the state police lab, the Southern University police and the locals for their contributions to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the area's police force for its "hard work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
Friday morning LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "broken" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
“This is what we fear at all times,” Wade said.
Volcano sprays ash over Mexico City
The ash squirting out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The Centro Nacional de Prevenci<0xC3><0xB3>n de Desastres, Mexico’s public agency for crisis prevention, warned Mexico’s population on Saturday that they would have to stay away from the volcano after activity rose in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within a day.
The agency monitored several cases of bullying and shaking.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering the front routes of cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is located 72 km southeast of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for independence clashed with police, while several thousand took part in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote on disbandment.
A group of masked separatists were held back by riot police, bombarding them with eggs and powder paint, which caused dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Handcuffs also broke out later in the day, when police used batons to limit fighting.
For several hours, independence protesters stood and shouted “Never forget, never forgive”, face to face with Unionist protesters shouting “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension is still high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming overreaction, but it was a poor turnout because the vote was boycotted by most who opposed the release.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after police tried to stop the vote held at polling stations across the region.
Liberation groups camped on the streets overnight to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held, however, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes of Catalonia's ability to become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy to get a voice, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had trouble keeping the pressure up this year, after which many of their notorious leaders have gone into self-imposed exile or are in detention while awaiting trial for their part in the process.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support police, said the conflict was sparked by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been jailed for a trial since late last year, announced that he will stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
“To stand for election as a candidate in the European election is the best thing I can do to condemn the repression and regression of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three 33-, 34- and 39-year-old men were arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
An armrest may have also been fired at the car at some point.
Mengas attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Uplifted Livinston stunned the Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga turned out to be crucial, and Gary Holt’s side is now equal to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has still not won the away in the Premier League this season and will play against the leaders of Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will play home games against Rapid Wien in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, has remained undefeated through six games in the division. Head coach Holt has not yet lost a game after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against its slender guests
Holt's team was supposed to have led long before they scored, as their direct approach caused countless problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only forward the kick after slipping in to meet Craig Halkett header past the goal.
The host let the Rangers play in front of him, knowing that they could create problems for their guests by deadball.
And that’s how the decisive goal came about.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to give Menga a clear lead, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
By this stage, Rangers had had had the ball mostly all the time, but the home team's defense had proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a near-scoring that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston death ball in a wide pass.
Crossings constantly entered the Livingston box and were still saved, while two criminal claims – once after Halkett’s protest against substitute Glenn Middleton, and once at hand – were ignored.
“Fenomenalt” from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all fantastic, and continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The style of play and the crew have barely changed since they got to the top again, but Holt is to have much of the honor for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated an enormously well-organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on toe raises throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, did not have my inspiration to differ with.
Although they have sometimes been very good under Gerrard, they failed to live up to this standard.
The last part of the game was labs – they only made it to the home team’s half once – and it was a bit of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just a smile and blue sky on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the NATO allies.
There have been disputes over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security as the reason a crowd of 25,000 were not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters met nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan – many of them Kurds – also let themselves be heard, criticizing both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the split that follows a man hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford collision: cyclist killed in car collision
A cyclist is killed in a collision with a passenger car in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy road in Deptford southeast of the city, around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on the spot.
The crash comes just one month after a cyclist died in a collision where the driver escaped from the scene in Childrens Street, about a mile from Saturday’s collision.
The Metropolitan Police said police are working to identify the man and alert the relatives.
Roadblocks and bus rides are on site, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Riots
Six prison officers were injured in an incident at a high-security men's prison, according to the prison authorities.
Protests broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officers are recruited to handle the incident, which involves eight inmates and is limited to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on site.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been sent in to handle an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – those responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind bars and beatings.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, riot police were called in to deal with a serious incident where employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (may be beneficial for drought areas)
It’s the fault Arizona is hit by a tropical low pressure, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week, as Hurricane Rosa’s remaining power moves through the desert areas in the southwest and brings with it flood hazards.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that rain will start late Monday night.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix noted on Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained their status as a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5–10 cm of precipitation, with up to 15 cm of precipitation at some locations in the Mongollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to get between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of rainfall is possible in some areas.
For those who are out of flood danger, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, since the southwestern United States is currently in a drought.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, which is the second highest category,” according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa lands on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum wind strength of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves 19 km/h.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific, thereby losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm force Monday evening or afternoon.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico can be severe and lead to severe flooding.
“Total rainfall of 7.5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with opportunities for up to 25 cm of rainfall,” according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which then moves on through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
“The main danger expected by Rosa or the remnants of it is very severe rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States,” according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening flooding and liquid debris and rapids in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 04.00 BST on Sunday.
He was rushed to the hospital and his condition should be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
The police have asked anyone who may have mobile footage of the incident to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “saddened under the smallness and the mind” of the Democratic Party
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the reckless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has “saddened the smallness and the mind” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the accusations by Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault against her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about his allegations during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw how brilliant, skillful and brave” Kavanaugh was that day.
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of the most accomplished lawyers of our time, with flawless misconduct in public service,” he told a rally of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred discreetly to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republicans voting in the midterms.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
I’m not really a participant, but I’m a participant,” he said.
“That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats have the goal of “resisting and hindering.”
The Senate's first midterm vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to a Republican party leader's assistant.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian landslides and tsunami, the numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed and many were pulled out to sea by huge waves thundering against the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six-meter-high waves plunged into land around sunset, destroyed everything in its path and drove many into drowning.
The tsunami hit the heels of a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami danger arose yesterday, people still engaged in activities on the beach, did not immediately escape and ended up being victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Bureau of Crisis Management (BNBP), told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami was not alone – it took cars, logs and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Someone climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survive."
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Emergency Management Agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and smashed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the force from Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times more than the force of the atomic bomb that was dropped over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the damage as “comprehensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater country's coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, located closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely crippled, completely without information" from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a press release, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but authorities said the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard shouting desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passers-by on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water comes rushing towards the beach, and rivers with buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that has prevented communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The military has begun sending transport planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated are still desperately in need of food and other necessities.
The city’s airport is only open for assistance and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to more than 800.
It's awful.
World Vision staff from Donggala have safely arrived in downtown Palu, where they have sought shelter under a tent in the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed major destruction on the road, according to Doseba Sinai.
“They told me they saw hundreds of broken houses,” he said.
It's awful.
As aid organizations began the grim preparations to deliver emergency aid, some complained that foreign aid workers with much expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis zone until it is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘Greit, this is a national disaster,’ we can open the borders for international aid, but the situation has not yet gained any status.”
As the sun goes down on Palu for the second time after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miracle stories that illuminate the gloomy news after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was freed by rescue crews after spending two days trapped in ruins with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those captured in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional should wear,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes who participated in the beach festival in Palu.
But the messages only led to gray tick marks, rather than a pair of blue tick marks.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 under mini bank refill in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who filled a mini bank in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a mini-bank into the entertainment complex and got ready to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While busy, there was another man who “runs up behind the Brink’s employee” and steals a purse that was to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspected escapees from the scene, according to the press release, but police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity must contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Creation formerly known as Kanye West.”
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for a long time, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, after she canceled on an “emotional basis,” according to the show’s creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year when discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from being Kanye, meaning the only one, to just Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a representation of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, which has previously collaborated with West, has also varied between the use of dashes and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexico’s incumbent president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed that he will never use military power against civilians as the country approaches its 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he "will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Military troops fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements swept across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Financial Support for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, an investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements regarding artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, in turn, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point as all other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next major breakthrough,” Lee said.
Double financial support may double the chance that the next major achievement in artificial intelligence comes from the United States,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop an artificial intelligence system that beat America's best Othello player, and later was a head of Microsoft Research or director of Google's Chinese department.
Lee recognized the U.S. government’s previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held, to help find the next generation’s smart heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive state grants, according to Lee.
“It’s not China that steals the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed smart heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that those who have a PhD in artificial intelligence should receive residence permit offers automatically,” he said.
China's Council of State issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other state organizations allocate money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, they are currently investing more than $100 million in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the U.S. law, which aims to establish a national artificial intelligence security commission, has been suspended for several months.
Macedonian voters vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia” to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbor is a requirement on Greek territory, and has vetoed including them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new nave, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the meeting will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: “Are you for NATO and EU membership when approving the agreement with Greece.”
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protective umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it will probably be decisive, because a high enough number of Members have said that they will comply with the outcome of the vote.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission has said they had not received any irregularity reports by 13.00.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
“I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open the doors for them to become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small scene and drew chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the vote.
“We are positive for NATO and the EU, but we will be signed in with a raised head, not thrown in the back,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our own value.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead badly needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will be for, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He says that a “yes” answer will be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of eligible voters will participate in the referendum – this is lower than the required attendance.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of those who responded have plans to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the attendance must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle the pro-Western government has encountered since it took over in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvers past Brighton's entire defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2–0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass at the start of the sequence.
He ran for a race with three Brighton defenders before coming out on the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a pass to the left that reached Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used the right shoe to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told the press.
“We talked about him going to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
He was lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the original advantage in the Premier League game.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball placed in Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a couple of touches before he led Sterling to the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was over the dead line.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12.55pm on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be a spoiler for the Rockies.
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and have no reason to bet strongly.
However, the always equally competitive Scherzer hopes to stand on the pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoffs of the Colorado team, who lead the Los Angeles Dodgers with one game in the NL West.
The Rockies got a wild card spot with a 5–2 victory over Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure their first division title.
Although we have nothing to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be what will most likely be the highest level of fighting I get to play on this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in it?”
The Nationals have not yet announced their starting pitcher for Sunday, but are reportedly likely to take the Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won 18 games this season and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 innings.
Trump's People's Assembly in West Virginia
The president referred discreetly to the situation around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while talking about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big ... I’m not a participant, but I’m a participant. That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this gruesome, gruesome group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take power back at all costs, where you can see the smallness and the badness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to override to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, aim to “resist and prevent.”
“And you see it over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “mindful and bad and ugly and dishonest.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee and named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, after which the audience bowed loudly.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um no, I’m waiting for one – it was very bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don’t tolerate people who say their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a long line of Labour Members who have been told that we are not welcome just because we say what we mean.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was censored because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding how important it is to have responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe – ironically similar things that Jeremy disagreed with former leaders about.
On the run-up to the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday evenings have been just that.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood of many of the meetings, and the promise of a “softer, more friendly” policy is too long forgotten if it ever began at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I previously believed I shared many political views with suddenly began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed to, whether they were about the nation’s security or the EU’s internal market.
When I speak in public – and it has nothing to say what I say – I receive a wealth of nasty social media messages that require me to be fired, condemn central politics and tell myself that I shouldn’t be in Labour.
And it's not just me who's experienced this.
I know that I am more fortunate than any of my colleagues, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they encounter a sea of discriminatory and racist comments every day, but never let themselves be caked.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross discrimination has become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every mistrust proposal and every change of the electoral rules will narrow the party down.
I have received a lot of advice over the past two years where I am encouraged to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much, because it will “make everything better.”
That’s not why I was involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by Thatcher’s government neglect that had led to my classroom at the public school I attended being literally fallacious, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as local councillor and government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, even in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can in any way have misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the proposal on Friday, I would just say that as the country is racing our way towards a Brexit that will harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot grasp and understand the desire to waste my time and effort on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum – it’s to those I represent, whether they’re Labour members or not: I’m proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of dismissal or political uncompromisingness will stop me from doing what I think best suits your interests.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the final result slightly, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this stunningly entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They are now at the top of the table and are the only undefeated of the ten.
In the end, there was as much of their superior defense as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities they had given to the home team that led to the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be pleased.
“We have been challenged in our games so far and are still undefeated, so I must be happy with that,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “All the honor to Ayr, they were better at taking advantage of the opportunities than we were.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, with a goal kick from Frazier Climo gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, loaned from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to level the position, and Jason Baggot performed a goalless try.
Climo strengthened Ayr's lead with a penalty kick before he, just before a break, scored and scored a solo attempt to change the position to 17–5 at a break.
But Melrose started the second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, with a goal kick from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This became a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried out on stretchers, and from the start, Ayr's management further increased the oath of a try from Stafford McDowell, with a goal kick from Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blain Macpherson, then got a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having an extra man on the field to the fullest with an attempt by Bruce Colvine without a target, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team came back strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling Climo when he did not have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown at the throw-in behind the advancing Ayr maul.
Climo performed a goal kick, as he did again almost entirely from the start, after Kyle Rowe acquired David Armstrong's boxing kick and sent flankers Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth try.
Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to be heading into the catering business – it was recently discovered that he is named as the director of a restaurant company with a gift certificate.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, for which he writes scripts and plays along with his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' finale, and it looks like Kiernan is now planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s “living restaurant business.”
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, a country without a coastline, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a rigging-covered marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea-blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it.”
The entire nation-state of Bolivia still has fresh memories of the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, and the country longs for once again being able to sail the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be greater than they have been for decades, with Bolivia awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has momentum, community spirit and peace of mind, and of course awaits the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the judgment of the International Court of Justice on big screen in many different places in the country, in the hope that the court in The Hague will give its verdict in favor of Bolivia’s claim that Chile – after decades of sporadic negotiations – is committed to negotiating to give Bolivia its own garden.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – facing a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also staked heavily on Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to a return to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly take Bolivia’s party, and that very little would change if it had done so.
The UN body, as the team in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give away Chilean land, and has stipulated that it will not decide the outcome of any negotiations.
That the judgment of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the latest arguments were heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” according to Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia’s cause, the last four years may actually have made things worse.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has tarnished any remaining goodwill on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations on one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court's decision came unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will provide “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile” and “to put an end to 139 years of disagreement, to the benefit of both parties.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, has used the maritime situation as a political shelling.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
“Knowledge is an opportunity to see what we must do to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear weapons won’t happen unless they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never lower its nuclear weapons if they cannot trust U.S. authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to abide by the promises it made during a meeting between the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to launch the locked-in nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s a “desire” that continued sanctions and U.S. resistance is a declaration that ends the Korean War will ever force North Korea to its knees.
U.S. authorities are skeptical to accept the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really plans to let go of an arsenal the country probably sees as the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest in huge headwear, which is heading towards a clothing store near you
If you want some great addition to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don’t have to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of strange, oversized headwear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the fashion lions at the fashion show in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino’s most eye-catching garment was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a spring-like wide brake that drowned the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard hat or even an pineapple, but they are not made to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had resuscitated lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One creation reminded of diving equipment, including snorkeling and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in biscuits.
And if you’re looking for even bigger fashion accessories, then you’re in luck.
Style experts predict that the huge hats may be on their way to a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come right into the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a half-metre-wide brake that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand behind the highly impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent yet another great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as big as the swimsuit model that wears it.
The orange raffia bag, which is lined with raffia fringes and complemented by a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching creation in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the fashion show in Paris.
Famed fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer – when the designer has had such a big impact it will be difficult to overlook the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for world citizens
Scotland’s free schools continue to demonstrate academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another one year of excellent exam results. These are supported by individual and joint success in sports, art, music and other social measures.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools, have more than 30,000 students across Scotland, and work hard to deliver the very best school experience to both students and parents.
Fris schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and in demand elective discipline at schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, when words reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, his words reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s exam results, we see that language is at the top of the table with the highest percentages of admissions from free schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the grade A.
The data, obtained from the council’s 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students received the grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that free schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a choice of subjects is now valued at the same level as real sciences such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics on the curriculum for free schools and other places.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for reasons stated by employers to have problems occupying a vacant position, 17 percent could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalized world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive edge.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investing in language training is now crucial for today’s children.
Being able to speak more languages, especially those related to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be most valuable to the UK on the road towards 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what interests your child, there will always be a selection of languages to choose from at the nursery schools, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today’s global business environment that language is still crucial to the country’s future, and this must be reflected in teaching.
Modern languages should actually be considered “international communication skills”.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.

LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to watch LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is still not decided.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for the Lakers' six-game preseason plan.
“I don’t need preseason players at this stage of my career,” he said.
Time for Trump’s meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
The president will start a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump’s five scheduled public meetings over the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his elected Supreme Court candidate has been put on hold, Trump aims to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voters go to the polls in November.
When is Trump’s West Virginia People’s Meeting tonight, and how can it be viewed online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to start at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia public meeting online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely discuss the week’s hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault. An expected confirmation vote is set for up to one week while the FBI investigates the case.
The main goal of all these referendums is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that these five people’s meetings over the next few weeks are aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move towards a busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight’s rally, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, may attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and is covered by the Pittsburgh press,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, an expert on political science at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows fighting spirit to retain faith as they enter Sunday's singles game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may have been just what this year’s Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a completely fictional sports concept, but still something players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
“They led by six points and now it’s four, so we’re going to carry it with us as a bit of a momentum,” Jordan Spieth said as he left the pitch for the day.
Of course, Europe will have the advantage – they lead by four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, Americans feel like they’ve got some wind in their sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tee to green, and leads by example.
The deep celebratory screams became higher as his round continued, and sank to a decisive put-down to raise the match to a draw when he and Thomas were down two after two.
His putting, which won them the match at 15, was met with a similar scream – of the sort that shows that he still doesn’t think the American team is unopposed.
“We really just have to put all the clothes on and focus on our own match,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have received more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly Ryder Cup’s big success story.
Europe’s unusual but glorious couple have four out of four and don’t set a foot in error.
"Moliwood" was the only pair to avoid a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also to avoid the bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the vibrant crowd make it clear that they are Sunday’s biggest competitors, and there are no other players the public would rather see securing a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time, in each hole.
However, it is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily jammed up with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he was partnering with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles during the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swedes were so far behind that they did not have the nubbesian to take the lead again.
But on Sunday there is no help.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look at closely because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give each other, the advice they do not give and how a strategy can turn in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the fighting spirit some, especially in the United States, have missed.
Europe leads 10–6 at the start of last day in Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong lead at the start of the Ryder Cup last day, having completed Sunday's four-ball and foursomes matches with 10–6 lead against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins against a broken Tiger Woods, raising their score for Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's European side, fighting to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unlucky side in the morning's fourballs and won the series 3–1.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they were not allowed to take any of the lead.
Jim Furyk's side must score eight points from Sunday's 12 singles game to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari – who together have been nicknamed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend – are the only pair to score four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they collaborated seamlessly to defeat Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with even more repressive 5&4.
Woods, who stayed through two matches on Saturday, glimmered occasionally, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and performed a 2&1 win against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked number one and three worldwide.
But Europe did not get everything as they wanted on this warm day with light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won the majors three times, set the standard for Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a hard-fought 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team managed to recover after a four-point lead at the start of the singles game, but as current owners only need Furyk's side to score a tie to keep the trophy.
But after being second best in two days, it doesn’t seem like they will be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea 'in no way' will agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions bolstered the distrust of the United States and that the country will in no way agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual general meeting that North Korea has implemented “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test area and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We haven’t seen a similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not, under any circumstances, unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done previously.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work against “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first’, lifting pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposing ‘the declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The belief that sanctions can force us to knee is a dream of desire for people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader stressed in front of the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: "If the other party in this disarmament case was South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear arms of the Korean Peninsula would not have been as locked as it is."
The tone of Ri’s speech, however, was very different from last year’s when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on mainland America with North Korea’s missiles was inevitable after Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
After threatening to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, Trump stood in front of the UN this year and praised Kim for being brave enough to take disarmament steps, but said much work remains to be done, and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is nuclear-armed.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he didn’t have a time frame for this, saying, “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures that have been taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s sanctions must still be enforced vigorously and without exception, until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to disrupt the financing of Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile weapons program.
Pompeo met Ri at the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said they had made progress, but only hours after North Korea accused him of making “gangsterious demands.”
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to shut down a missile area and a nuclear facility if the United States took "similar measures".
He said Kim had said that these “similar measures” he wanted were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students get more sleep by tackling the growing ukulele culture by plunging through the night with coffee drinks as fuel.
One scholar found that students at the world’s best university often had no clue how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a lecture on the effect of lack of sleep on learning.
“After the lecture, a girl came over to me and said, ‘Why hasn’t anyone said this before?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts up this year, explains how important it is with good sleep habits to be able to perform academically and athletically, and for the general condition.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university’s health services professor, said the university decided to start the course after they saw that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for one hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a room in a dormitory where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books and learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another part, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know about this, just as you have the right to know about the risk of smoking,” said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to snuggle all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students led to sleep deprivation being an increasing problem.
Good sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode, leading to a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course. He took one of the classes to the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all master’s students to take a similar study program before enrolling in the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm for when to lie down as well as for when to get up, and that they need to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights. This type of light can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Menga targets Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another away loss when Dolly Menga's goal beat Steven Gerrard's team 1–0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted their first win since February's 4–1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager and left his side eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga hit to seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers never managed to equalize.
The Rangers now fall in sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third and is behind Hibernian on goal difference.
There may be more trouble in the yeast for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an item was thrown away from the audience.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, who swept past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 that took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been happy about how his well-trained team beat the opponents.
Rangers may have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored just two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
A long free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the target bar.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed to lean more on hope than belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he would have a penalty kick after a quarter when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson refused.
Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not get into trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Liv's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the game's course, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Again, the Rangers failed to handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he selected Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent during the break, and the player exchange gave immediate results when the winger sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get away players to play exactly the kind of game they like, catching Lithgow and Halkett long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the lead in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before Lithgow's head from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late call for a penalty kick as he came into conflict with Jacobs, but again saw Thomson away.
Almanac: The Invention of the Geiger Teller
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the apparatus we know today as the Geiger teller.
The Geig teller has been an important part of science since then, and also became a part of popular culture through the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is it?"
Rogers: “It’s a geiger counter, it finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you touch these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals emits.”
Evans: “It’s supposed to make sound now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention he gave his name to lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to Recognize Cancer Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
The cells can now “see” a protein that is common in many cancers, and then be injected into the patient again.
A vaccine under trial has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, found that the ovarian cancer she suffered from disappeared for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, which is typical of many cancers, and then injecting these cells into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "drives the growth of different types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method, in which immune cells were taken from the patient and "trained" to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.

Kanye West was booked into the studio on Saturday Night Live after a frantic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After performing his third song for the night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he extended out against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
“It happens so often that I talk to a white person and say to him, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’”
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee about the allegations of sexual assault that Christine Blasey Ford filed.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the footage.
West also complained to the audience that he was allowed to hear it in the back room regarding the choice of headwear.
“But he bullied me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
But I'm being bullied!
And then they said I don’t understand what reality is,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want me to understand what the reality is?” he said, saying that he would “touch me the Superman cap, because then no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try to love.”
His comments were arcing at least twice, and the employees who worked at SNL looked embarrassed, Variety reported, where a staff member said: “The whole studio was deadlocked.”
West was brought in as the last small replacement for singer Ariana Grande when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of our bravest: THANK YOU TO STAY IMOT MASSENE.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is “just who he is and it’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’ which I think cultivates and exudes ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
We are too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. He said that from now on he was "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and now follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion, and of course the late music-loving Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Indicted for attempted murder after stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
Targets are expected to be produced for Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The penalty will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington longs for "gifty masculinity"
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and says such roles on film often make young men think they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something has gone wrong and wondered how to attack the problem of “toxic masculinity” in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he was very concerned about the subject.
“I’m pretty worried about it right now – where did the masculinity go wrong?” he said.
“How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that TV may have part of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to the strongly masculine roles.
He continued: “What is conceived and what is conceived?
What is broadcast on TV and on the street, what makes young boys feel that they have to cultivate just this side of being a man?
I think that’s one of the really big questions of our time – how can we change that?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admits that he will not make any predecessors or successors of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play the lead role in a remake of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a rancher.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the recordings, so that way something good came out of it – my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, whom Kit's character Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, the health representative said.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted via sex, which marks a change from before.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China by infection through blood transfusions.
But the number of people getting HIV in this way is now closer to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Much of the disease is due to insufficient protection by sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have promised public access to HIV medicine as part of a measure to address the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects employee leaked data on Republican senators, phishing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
A member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, on Saturday rejected allegations that members of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat assured of the allegations was made by “ultra-conservative” commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the allegations of abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, Hill said.
“This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a regular lie,” Waters continued.
“The members of my staff – who have been compromised by their identities, personal data and security as a result of these dishonest and false accusations – had absolutely no responsibility for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a regular lie.”
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, among others by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is aggressive,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
They must not go in defense.
They must not doubt the motives of the accused.
They must act calmly and calmly.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too aggressive during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate working to remove Waters in the midterms, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great – if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted “relevant authorities and police about these false allegations.”
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all actions that are destructive and dangerous to each of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again – Bloody Rowan Atkinson in Spy Parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit interpretations in all new films with a British flair and it seems to be relevant to this resurgence of the parody franchise Johnny English action comedy – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastically self-sacrifice about how obviously hopeless we are to become the nation’s new export?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bubbling eyes and rubber face has renewed his license to mess it up for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comical figure intended on territories with non-English-speaking cinema audiences.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a cover of Mr Bean, and a portion of the guy who contributes with a single note in the music of the fire department during the opening ceremony at the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the long-forgotten television commercials for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
It’s a great moment in Johnny English’s recent journey.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades snowed his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is coming to fruition, but the humor feels quite bloodless and strangely superfluous, especially now that the “serious” brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible are willing to step away from comedy.
The humor seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and for me Johnny English’s fads aren’t as inventive and sharp as the silent filmmakers in Mr Bean.
The current premise is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the horror of the vigilante – a regrettable small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister, a pompous and downtrodden figure who is already undergoing a complete crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this like-Teresa-May role, but the script does not give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform that since every active spy has been revealed, she must bring in some of the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snobby establishment, but provides unofficial instruction in secret intelligence. There are some cool sequences here, when English offers a rock academy for espionage.
English is snatched back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, troubled helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, played with a submarine commander, a hysterical upper-class lady role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin style of messing up everything else on the queen's mission is back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko's amazing femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is seduced by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s cyber problems: the sleazy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey with farce-like sideways: disguised as waitresses set them on fire at a sparkling French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding on board Volta’s luxury yacht; and English triggers the pure anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to make himself known in Volta’s house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so loving and noisy it is then there is a lot that resembles children's TV with the whole thing.
Quite mediocre, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I could only think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour denies they are working out plans to let the British work four days a week, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider a radical plan that will give the British four-day workweek — but get paid for five.
The party will obviously want business leaders to use savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving employees an extra weekday off.
This will result in employees getting a three-day weekend while receiving the same salary.
Sources say the idea fits into the party’s economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of workers.
The trade unions support the transition to a four-day week so that workers can also enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to let the pendulum swing to the workers’ benefit – as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party promised a four-day week during the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary election.
However, the idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day week is not the politics of the party and is not something that is being considered by the party.”
Labour finance spokesman John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of “faceless directors” and “profiters” from public service providers.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are in danger of not returning the entire shareholding because a Labour government can “deduct” from perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and create employee funds to transfer 10% of the equity to private sector companies to employees, who can receive an annual dividend of <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy Tell '60 Minutes' About Kavanaugh's FBI Boundaries Could Make Them Change Their Mind
The FBI review of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could cause some Republican senators to change their minds.
In an interview that aired on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in "60 Minutes" asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to it than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said at the start of the hearing that I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, “Did you do that?”
He was determined, scrupulous, unambiguous.”
Graham's voice, however, appears to have been cut into stone.
“I’ve decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and that would have to be a startling finding,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it energetically,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t think anything new will change that.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it helped fight poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission; eradicated the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, which is now in its seventh year, will cause thousands of people to stream to the great lawn of Central Park, not only to experience sizes such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness around the event’s real goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, taking a phone call or in other meaningful ways to raise awareness around their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for change, or just another case of so-called “clickivism” – that people feel they contribute greatly by signing a subscription campaign online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 they have registered more than 19 million “actions” from supporters, with a wealth of different goals.
They say these actions have helped make world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was able to show 390 engagements and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main concerns are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the UK to “help children exploit their full potential,” promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, the UK’s ambassador for Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the UK to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
The global citizen replied: “There will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the important civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists performing at this year’s New York event, which will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the navy as "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington can "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially when operating at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate on energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe,” he said.
And according to the speaker, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
“The U.S. has through the Navy the ability to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that profiles itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, noting that they are far on the same path.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as “one trick pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements came after the Trump administration has been on a round trip to strengthen the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe. They want to replace Russia, the far cheapest option for European consumers.
Employees of the Trump administration, including the president himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project The Northern European Gas Line 2, which according to Trump made Berlin "capture" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline worth $11 billion, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has met with opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments in the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have major problems with third countries interfering in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “think seriously” on her 2020 presidential candidacy, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “think seriously” about whether she would run for president after the midterm elections.
During an election meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would stand down.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix the shaky government, and that includes a woman on top,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider whether to run for president.”
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election and said he "led the country in the wrong direction".
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
A poll published on Thursday, however, shows that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe she should stand by 2020.
58% of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not be silent, according to a poll from the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidacy.
The poll showed higher support for former governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palin's PTSD during Trump's election
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after enlisting in Sept.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through after coming home, I have in common with other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers have with them,” she told the audience at an election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “the elephant in the room” and said of his son and other war veterans: “They come home a little differently, they come home hardened, they come home and wonder if this is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country.”
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, including a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while he was intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police.
18 states and D.C. support testing of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. provided an orientation from amicus curiae (a friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that the partner "and his violent gang members" abused her, but officials in the United States rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations that have pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Immigrants that granted undocumented immigrants who fled domestic violence permission to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “is missing from many decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum requirements be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban is contrary to that principle,” said amicus curiae.
The lawyers further argued in the briefing that the policy that denied immigrants access harms the U.S. economy and says there is a high probability that they will become entrepreneurs and “contribute with the necessary labor.”
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political view,” Sessions said in a June 11 announcement on the policy.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue action in Palu – death toll doubles in search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“It was very exciting,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforts her fever-stricken son at an evacuation center in the collapsed town of Palu.
“All the time you see ambulances that pick up the dead.
Clean water is scarce.”
One could see residents coming to ruined homes and ease through water-damaged possessions in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were damaged in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, sit outside Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing severe aftershocks.
He gets tears in his eyes as he recounts how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to be safe.
I was squeezed by the wall that crashed together, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Tracasting’ With ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper that judged the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the appendix China Daily paid to move into the Des Moines Register – the top-selling newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, an accusation China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the U.S. election marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China, U.S. officials said.
While it’s normal for foreign governments to use ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has brought new rounds of tariffs on each other’s imported goods.
China’s sanctions early in the trade war were to hit export companies in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts reported.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a readership post in Sunday’s Des Moines Register: “China is now stepping up its harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities are taking advantage of the freedom of expression and the open press that we enjoy in America to put in a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“As a contrast – at the newspaper booth on the street here in Beijing you will not find many divergent opinions and will not experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media is below the thumbs of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: “One of China’s biggest newspapers refused to publish” his article, even though he did not disclose which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare away female voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, warns analysts
As many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has received multiple allegations of sexual assault directed against him, analysts warn that they will get a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The feelings around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s proposal for an FBI investigation at the last second would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget yesterday’s events – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters sang "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the aisles of the Senate when the Republicans who control the judiciary decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already been high, that’s true.
But it could have been higher, especially among female insecure voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote even if they dislike the president.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which gave a detailed description of the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts thought there would be a counter-reaction if the Republicans forced through the appointment.
“This has become a blessed root for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or final approval or Kavanaugh being inducted – it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group promoting the election of Democratic candidates, told the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to be somewhat divided over who they are to believe in the aftermath of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a small majority in favor of the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41% of respondents were completely or quite convinced of Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were completely or quite convinced of Kavanaugh’s fabrication.
In addition, 38% said they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh was lying during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's expulsion, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh was in a drunken state of abuse when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals while they were at a party during the study period at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web’s author plans to launch a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where their data should be stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose is "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the start.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal data warehouse online” or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at a time.
What is unique about the personal data stored online is that it is entirely up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data".
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, that the company should provide resources, process and relevant expertise to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers on contract to work with the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce something completely new, which will make their business models completely revamped overnight.

Bernard Vann: Celebration of Victoria Cross Recipients of World War I
The only priest in the English Church who was awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Vann was awarded the Honorary Certificate on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a “great symbolism” that the stone was to be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September – “through very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.”
Later, he crashed towards the firing line and led the line "with great courage" forward before storming a field cannon independently and striking out three of the divisions.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just one month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Corps.
Michael Vann said he “felt very honored to play a role in the parade,” adding: “The bravery of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people.”
MMA fans were up all night to watch the combat sports program Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa pigs
Imagine that you’ve been up all night watching the packed Bellator 206, just to discover that you won’t see the main game.
The San Jose participant managed through 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, the viewers in the UK were sitting still when the picture suddenly showed Peppa Pig.
Some were less impressed after staying awake until early in the morning to watch the match.
A fan described on Twitter the transition to the children's program as "a kind of sick joke".
“It’s government regulation that it’s not appropriate to broadcast such programs at 6:00, so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes!".
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they are going to work on the broadcast plan to include viewers in Britain in the future.
“I think we can figure it out for the rematch,” Coker said.
“But it’s 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, and we won’t be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me - when we sat down, there were a lot of messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly of the kind.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But that wasn't it, it was a government thing.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We want to reduce from six to five games – which we usually send – and we tried to stretch far for the fans, but tipped over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior in terms of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority toward everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn’t until he was in high school that he realized that “he wasn’t like everyone else.”
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that being a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular programmer for the traditional program, Kirsty Young, is due to be gone for a few months due to illness.
Daley appeared a little off on Laverne's first broadcast and said he felt "less worthy" than anyone else he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, these feelings of being inferior and different have been the real motivation and have me the strength and the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he “was something,” he said, so he did not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is a two-time bronze medalist at the Olympics and has become a highly-profile LGBT ambassador. He used his participation at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands out because he feels he is lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences and want to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” – he attended his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had been changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie".
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept him to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had gotten tickets to London 2012 – since he wanted to sit on the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit on the front row,” he said.
“I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – which meant a lot to him in the run before the Olympics and which still gives him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Formsvike Mickelson taken out to the golf tournament Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to get in shape if there is not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for the impressive 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday’s four-ball and four-some games.
Instead of being at the center of the events, as he had so often been for the United States, the five-time major-win splits the day between being a full-time leader and working with his game on the rank in hopes of correcting what is going on.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even at the top of his career and is not in perfect shape for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough area still penalises mischievous blows.
And if the pitch itself is not scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, meets British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 singles games, get a successful start, Mickelson’s games can prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expresses confidence in her husband, not that he could say anything else.
“He fully understood what role he had today, gave me a slap on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has contributed so much to these teams before, and this week.
I didn’t think he was going to play two games.
I saw more for myself, but that’s how it ended, and that’s how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most played Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his participation added some intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty and likes to have sex with others. He’s a great guy to have in the storage room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week too, and it was fun to see.
“He’s more than just the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that his great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant management at the entrance to the final day's singles game in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
Denmark made their debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but raced to victory with the least possible margin, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You still remember yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday led 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else on that team that this is not over.
You'll give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that’s trying to win this trophy, and that’s where the focus lies.
I’ve always said I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re very aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn is very pleased with how his players have managed on the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t have done it better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that stand in the center, and it is something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re out there alone, your achievements as a golfer are tested to the full.
It’s the message that you have to convey to the players that they need to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he has to go out and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, opponent Jim Furyk will try to get his players to perform better individually than they did as partners. The exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the great upheavals of the last day, joining the winning team at Brookline before ending up as a loser when Europe performed the "miracle at Medinah".
I remember every damn word of it," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had been angry with his players at the end of the day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to get a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, which we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum starts to go in one direction, it puts a great deal of pressure on the middle games.
We then arrange our set-up and send people out the way we feel. You know, we’re trying to create something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the game and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the top half of the game.
“I bet on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said of his selection of singles.
Germany's new warship delayed once again
German Navy's latest frigate was reportedly completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War days, but it will not happen until early next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, local media reported.
The completion of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery followed the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class navy ordered back in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is agreed that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from the home port.
However, steady delays mean that the advanced warships – they were said to give Germany strength at sea – will already be out of date before they are put into service, reports Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 frigate created headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important as vessels in the Baden-Wuertemberg class are to be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the crew on older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also discovered that the ship has a huge excess weight, which reduces performance and limits the Navy’s ability to make upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class that were used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project – including the training of the crew – has also started to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion – from the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are particularly important in light of fresh warnings that Germany’s naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German government’s defense committee, confirmed that the navy actually “goes empty for usable ships”.
The official said the problem has escalated over time because old ships were out of service, but no new ships came.
He regrets that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
The National Trust steals the secret life of bats
New research carried out at a land estate in the Scottish Highlands will reveal how bats use the landscape in the pursuit of food.
There is hope that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help design future conservation measures.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as brown-throated bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert audio analyses of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bats and which species do what.
Then a habitat map and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on what measures should be taken, such as laying grazing land and how best to take care of the forest for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and construction that affects nesting sites and habitat restriction.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, the same with fly paper and certain chemically treated building materials as well as attacks from house taxes.
The bats are not blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they need more ears than eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced ecolocalization to find insects and obstacles on the road when they fly.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly carry out surveys, surveying of nesting sites and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only own bat reserve at the Threave land estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bats.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threadave we have a perfect area for bats,” he says.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He emphasizes how important it is to map the bats before it is carried out maintenance on a property since the inadvertent destruction of a single nesting site can kill up to 400 females and young, and perhaps alienate an entire local population.
Flags are protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disrupt them or destroy their breeding grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help in the work.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we simply don’t know how the populations manage.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges While Lawyers Will Succeed German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape charges against him as “fake news” and says people “want fame” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is accused of paying her $375,000 later for keeping close to the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking on a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo dismissed the charges as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the five-time winner of the Golden Ball said in a statement.
“They want fame by using my name.
It's normal.
They want fame by giving my name, but that’s part of the job.
I’m a happy man and I’m fine,” adds the footballer with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called “an unacceptable portrayal of suspicions in the private sphere,” according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says the footballer will claim compensation for “reputation injuries to an extent that corresponds to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of privacy in recent years.”
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents presented to the Clark County, Nevada District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99% a good person" who was disappointed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later they filed a settlement outside the courthouse because she was "free from revenge" and was also concerned about "being publicly exposed".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to set the settlement aside because she is still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault, moving this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain ‘will mourn forever’ about losing car manufacturers
Britain “will mourn forever” if it loses its status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, they would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the consequences of delayed border crossings in a possible no-deal Brexit could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, in my view, we will see production at our factory halt,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how trade across borders will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether what car manufacturers say is supply chain risks in the event of a possible no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on the basis of "order as needed" and parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a stay at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day of stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus production will cease.
Clark said Theresa May’s Brexit plan for further ties with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid such checks at the border.”
“We need to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that makes us, as I say, not only able to enjoy success at the moment, but that we seize this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that increased costs in the long run would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the union leader at the factory, said that members are becoming increasingly concerned: “My experience dictates that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump’s fateful meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “scheduled for another week” as the fight around Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump’s aides and Russia, as well as possible obstruction of justice on the part of the president.
The question of whether Trump will dismiss the Attorney General or not, and thus threaten Mueller’s independence, has for many months plunged into speculation in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of recording conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was about to resign voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who at the time was at the UN in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid it colliding with the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI review of charges against Kavanaugh, further putting a full vote on the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for the meeting was not set. It could be this week, but I realized it could be a week’s delay because of everything going on with the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I’m always keen to keep the press up to date.”
Some journalists will dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Programmer Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to opposition to the “self-belief” of TV reporters, although she added: “I don’t disagree that they are self-defeating.”
Then she suggested that contact between Trump and the press would become more frequent.
“The president does more questioning than any previous president,” she said, adding without providing evidence: “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press gets the chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We’re trying to make it happen often, and you’ve seen that we’ve done it often in recent weeks, and it’s going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open assignments or press conferences when visiting key people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause when he conducted a solo race and at times had a strange behavior in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland regarding Brexit concerns
The health secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and a desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain was to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have taken place during the summer and are expected to land on a solution by autumn.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario without a deal.
I understand this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I value the efforts of each individual employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and enhances the work of healthcare for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we sincerely hope you will stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after suffering a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in the Tennesseean newspaper.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the first half was over.
"He came out on the sideline and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel provided Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him behind for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/ extent of the damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in her first season with Tennessee State after transitioning from Illinois.
He had five tackles Saturday before he finished the game, giving a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. According to new Tory plans, the extra money will be used to help the homeless
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters
The document fee increase will be collected from those who do not pay tax in the UK
Experts in the Ministry of Finance expect it to increase to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters with a promise to offer more affordable housing and frame high-income groups.
The increase in document fees will be imposed on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will strengthen the government’s measures to remedy the situation of the homeless.
The profit – which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher rate introduced two years ago on housing number two and home purchase for rent – can be as much as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by people who do not live in the UK. This drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get their foot in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “spooky cities” because of the many foreign buyers who mostly reside outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the document fee to help more young people own their own homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May reject quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain’s “shameful housing policy.”
Jeremy Corbyn has announced an alarming array of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to unjustified drafts.
He also wants to give municipal councils greater power to build new housing.
“Last year I said that I would buy my time as prime minister to restore the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also foreign-based companies, to buy homes as it is for hard-working British citizens.
For a very large number of people, the dream of owning their own homes has become too distant, and the unworthy situation of the homeless persists.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland’
Sunderland’s boss, Jack Ross, says his “final goal” is to become Scotland’s manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scott is looking forward to the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I got a B-caps and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I was often with my father and saw Scotland on Hampden as a child, and there is always something that pulls me back.
But that opportunity would only come if I succeed in the club leadership.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not worried about following such established names in the big club, and has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be measured if I can get the club back in the Premier League".
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League,” he said.
It’s not an easy task to get it there, but I’ll probably just consider myself successful here if I get the club back there.”
Ross has only been in charge for three years, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month short appearance in Hearts' coaching loss.
Then he helped Alloa recover from a draw to the third division and helped St Mirren from the draw to win the championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real roadblock,” he recalls when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was the right thing for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did it well, created a reasonable income from it and experienced some nice highlights.
But football can be tough.
There are many things you need to get through on a weekly basis.
I’m progressing through it in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management feels absolutely right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. It feels like the most comfortable I’ve known throughout my adult life.”

Perfect time for half a liter is 17.30 on Saturdays, survey shows
This summer’s heatwave has boosted revenue for Britain’s hard-pressed pubs, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7% increase in sales in July – while revenue for restaurants fell 4.8%, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant, who summarized the figures, said: “Continued sunshine and England’s unexpected long participation in the World Cup led to July following a similar pattern as the previous month of June, when pubs rose 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The drop of 1.8% in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the far best result, but an increase that was stronger like-for-like than what restaurants went down.
Pubs with food service also had difficulty with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the restaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, turnover increased by 6.6% that month, with food service decreased by 3%".
Paul Newman, an analyst at the hotel and restaurant industry RSM, said: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and large sporting and social events are still the most important factors when it comes to sales on the outdoor market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups still have a hard time, and a 4.8% year-on-year turnover drop will be particularly painful at the peak of ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food service companies, and time will show if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide a much-awaited breathing room.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in rollout of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the industry turnover controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyzes the results from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to the study.
A survey of 20,000 junior high school students uncovered pages of “fake Insta.”
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they show their parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts – a reference to photo sharing sites on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about sexual content being shared.
20% of students said they had an innocent “main account” that they refer to their parents while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager urging others to “rape me.”
The research, which was conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Principals (HMC) for private schools found that 40% of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s frightening that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the ‘voice of athletes’ on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to gain insight into her extensive international experience over the past ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and worldwide athletics community, and we are confident that Scotland’s athletics athletes will enjoy getting her on board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guiding the sport in Scotland.”
The American won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and has a total of four Olympic golds. She is now a regular BBC expert, and after she suffered a transient ischemic attack, she was unable to walk.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago today I got a hit.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will be restored and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’m fine again and have learned to walk again, and today I’m doing agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump ad that compares mothers with cows splits opinion online
A breast pump company has split opinion online with an ad that compares nursing mothers with cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump that is carried close to the body,” Elvie, the technology-based consumer goods company, published a fresh and flirtatious, music-inspired ad to show the freedom the new pump provides active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows to a song with, among other things, the following lyrics: “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see any tail” and “In case you didn’t realize it, this isn’t an oath, it’s my tits.”
The chorus continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls.”
However, the ad, which is published on the company’s Facebook page, has created a storm online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many say it paints the “grossiness” of the dairy industry.
“Very poor decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth.
Elvie breast pump gets nice place in an amme-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hey, why not use them to advertise for a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added: “For a failed ad.”
One woman admitted that she thought the song was “incredibly funny.”
“I think it’s a great idea.
I'd like to have one if I'm still breastfeeding.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
“It’s a great product,” he wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and feel like ‘cows.’
This is not an advertisement that honors or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and gets a nice place in a nursing bra, so that women get the freedom to move, keep the baby and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all the challenges, while showing in an entertaining and recognizable way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a two-child mom appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border in secret
The number of detained migrant children has gone up even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children in supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid of destroying their own chances of staying in the country by stepping forward and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household had to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to be supporters of single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have a previous criminal record.
“Almost 80% of people who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
The officers are trying to deal with the children faster and introduced new rules that indicate that some of them must meet in court within one month of being arrested, and not 60 days that was the previous standard, according to receiving workers.
Many will be produced via videoconference rather than face up personally to file their case for residence permit for an immigration judge.
Those deemed to be unwarranted asylum-seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to reception workers and reports that have appeared in the sysem in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns have grown at a larger facility like Tornillo, where children who struggle more easily are overlooked due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without having enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can exacerbate traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria asks U.S., French and Turkish "occupational powers" to withdraw immediately
In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally staying on Syrian soil under cover of fighting terrorism and “will be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror, so to speak, is over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions are fleeing.
He said Damascus will continue to “lead this sacred struggle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories” for both terror groups and “all foreign presence.”
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said the conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused "certain Western countries" of "spreading irrational refugees" that make the refugees stay away.
“We have addressed the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
They are politicizing what is really a purely humanitarian situation.”
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the rebels’ last major defence position at Idlib has created an opportunity to push for political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement deterred a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces against the province where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the deal had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from Al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of state and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem made conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the committee and said the panel’s work should be limited to “review of the articles of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Period
According to that logic, Trump would have won re-election in 2020, unless, which many liberals are likely to hope, impeachment and scandals end the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly become “the most dramatic conclusion to a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of blindness.
Since 2014, the best-time viewership figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC “The Rachel Maddow Show” has peaked cable numbers with a total of 3.5 million viewers on nights with big news stories.
“This is a fire that people are attracted to because we don’t understand anything,” said Neal Baer, program director of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Why, she asked.
He said, “Because he makes me laugh.”
There is an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course – unlike anything else on TV – the actions taking place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Sign-out is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you stretch far to be an enlightened person when you sit for six hours to follow a panel of experts who discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep in the background" for the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather jacket with ostrich feathers worth $15,000, "the coat of Washington's beard with hybris", "the coat of the postman's beard", "the postman's beards beard of hybris".
I don’t want to watch Super Mario the same way anymore.
“One of the things he does that makes it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, the head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump’s varying cast and daily twist on the plot.

He could not tear himself apart, not when Brett Kavanaugh is to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the U.S. Supreme Court is at stake.
“I remember when we made all the crazy shows in the old days and people said that this is the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from outside flows into the most even midterm elections of the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district is experiencing a flow of money after a reshuffle of a congressional district that ended up two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly-recruited suburban district of Pittsburg stands with Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a supplementary election last spring.
Lamb faces another sitting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which greatly surpasses the new 17th district.
The map was redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were a constitutional manipulation of the constituencies in favor of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive campaign funding race between the largest party funding groups, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a closely followed supplemental election for Pennsylvania's 18th district to Congress in March last year.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a small lead.
U.S. Considered sanctions against El Salvador for aid to China, then pulled the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the leadership team of the Trump Organization.
Foreign ministry officials decided to recall U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed criminal measures, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials postponed a top-level conference that focused on security and economic growth to follow up a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, halting all plans for criminal action against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now framed to speak to the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration adds to the collection, the diplomat said.
And the three U.S. envoys returned calmly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or punitive measures from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations under the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next nail in the coffin may be Special Adviser Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is also reportedly in the process of expanding the investigation into whether Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia interfering in our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be put in charge of that body, amid preparations to meet voters again and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not mean to claim that Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor for his counterparts in Europe.
There must be a choice made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovakians at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
The course of history revolves around such tipping points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
The Americans are facing several of these tipping points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in harsh weather ever since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secret hearings by the president and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' production is incorrect.
“How will we react if the recently launched FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I do not think we will fail, because of the experience I gained in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me off to light the Sabbath candle on the table with the hook cross.
With such a legacy, how can I fail to look optimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday, confident that defeating the Austrians after Spain’s impressive draw against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season in the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use the result as a springboard to get bigger things.
“It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game and thought we could get something and got us one point.
Maybe we could have pulled in at the end, but the draw was probably a good result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second and were the best team.
On Thursday it will be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last game, but with the home crowd in the back I am sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
Last year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team is good and the guys are enjoying themselves; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand on now, put last season behind us and make it happen.”
Women lose sleep at night due to fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear outline of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they’re doing nothing to take that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to give you care if you don’t say what you want in advance.
Discuss with the counselor and the family where and how the care should be given. Such choices can be of great importance in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for your expenses.
The long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Clear legal issues immediately.
Get a health executive in place by appointing a person you trust to have an overview of your medical care, and make sure that health care workers will comply with your wishes if you should be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some power over your finances.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down the details in an overview so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just the economy that’s at stake – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medicines do you need?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have that overview in place.”
Man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times when he was on his way home after a night out.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. BST, as an "immotivated act".
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have requested witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The communication is out of service, and rescue workers have not been able to get information from the Donggala regentskap, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest part of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region below the provincial level, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s emergency aid administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that razed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A landslide hit the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded of the ravages of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok and kill more than 500 people, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused several thousand tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, including a report of domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he allegedly picked up the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged abuse.
Palin is jailed in Mat-Su custody prison and is arrested for an unsecured debt letter worth $500, KTUU reported.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, absolutely" when asked how he pleaded guilty, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he can be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offence, which can be punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is brought before the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, collusion with the report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake Tsunami: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed many thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and death toll is expected to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the outbreak.
Several hundred people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami plunged into the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been practiced in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he mowed down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “intentionally” and caused serious bodily harm intentionally, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for a possible death penalty, according to the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury threw the 22-point indictment, including eight counts of murder in connection with money-expression, in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and vehicle demolition.
The attack required “significant planning and foresight,” said the prosecutor, who described the way Saipov performed it as “holy, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, property and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlii, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pangnucco".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a case that could give the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was committed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He told investigators that he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He did not plead guilty after the 22-point indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s publicly appointed defenders, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the traumas of these events for everyone involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army” today during a demonstration during the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should feel the “pressure” from the Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested that he be held accountable for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that Britain “would have been out of line” now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile its deeply divided ranks has been underlined by the pro-Remain Tories who participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is fighting to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she would go on trying to make a deal with Brussels despite the setback – forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Bone told the Solihull protesters that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit plan".
When explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in two world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed claims that the referendum had changed since the 2016 vote: “The claim that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.”
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstration and told reporters: “I’m simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Brexit plan is unpopular with the public. The opposition is not going to vote for it. It is unpopular with the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who trash the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Reject the Brexit plan and start listening".
In a direct message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep the job when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians would be “feel the pressure” if they were thinking of betraying the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
“This is about trust between us – the people – and that politician,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to let them know they won’t get away with it.”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people’s army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before having a two-hour political gathering in the city centre.
A small amount of activists fanned with Tories Against Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis derided the conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app as the conference began.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about the future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice chairman of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that she will stand up to Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, who have used the town hall format since Trump became president.
One participant asked her if she planned to run as a presidential candidate.
Warren responded that it is time for “women to come to Washington to fix our flawed government, and that includes a woman at the top.”
Arrested after Sims of LSU was killed in shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, in a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result of it," Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene carrying weapons and confessed to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested unopposed and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims was a two-meter-high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starts last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims for World Championship title after Stallordre gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stallions would play a major role in the race.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and almost swept Hamilton off the field while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and let Hamilton continue to drive in the back of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some push-up with the wheels that reluctantly left the Ferrari driver inside free after a double pass to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the rear row of the field and came in seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race in large parts while on the wheels to try to make a quick finish and superman Kimi Raikkonen as number four.
He finally reached the depot in the 44th round, but failed to increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It is a difficult day because Valtteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me out.
The team has done a fabulous job to get a good toss,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump denied Senator Dianne Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her detention that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When the president spoke at an event in West Virginia, he did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead he commented that what happened in the Senate shows that people are “wrong, cruel, and speak wrong.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are angry and bad and ugly and speaking falsely,” he said.
“When you look at deliveries and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I haven't done it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember her answer... you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven’t played.”
Hey, wait a minute.
We played ... no, we didn’t,” he added, with a copy of the senator’s voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, which she asked for.”
But her denial was not graciously taken up by the president, who during the party event on Saturday night commented: “I’m going to tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the allegations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power with all necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overrun in order to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants received an early two-goal lead through shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalised for the home team before Dwyer restored the management for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefes men, who had come back after beating Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford quit the game when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt added up to Cownie's equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants had the lead on a break when he took his second goal for the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard equalled again with a championship goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the game late in the second half, and he secured the team's fifth semi-final victory.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, are playing at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers die to ensure hundreds of air passengers escape earthquake
A flight leader in Indonesia is hailed as having died and ensured that an aircraft that had many hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after colleagues had fled for life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly volatile control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely ease.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts burst when we heard it,” he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could rise to several thousand, and the country’s disaster preparedness body reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The figures are expected to rise further as many bodies are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been able to reach,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the body.
Up to six meters high waves have razed Palu, who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “All the time you see ambulances that pick up the dead.
There is a lack of clean water.
Minimarkets are being robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross works feverishly to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports a man missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which owned the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now says one man has been missing. They previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they did not have an overview of.
The airline said they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as they attempted to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just off the runway.
Some witnesses said the plane crashed on the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the airmen were panicking and screaming, and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby to repair a bridge, also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water surface.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in a crash with PNG-registered aircraft in the past twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts present timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed the proceedings on Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to pulsate the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted what he had previously claimed, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers’ cell phone at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford walked into the witness box Saturday and claimed that he was not in town that day.
When asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's trailer that night, Sanford said he "lied because my trailer was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile printing suggests that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Telli's calls, contact details and messages to and from Chambers were deleted from his phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Socially Engaged Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its origin with political messages to address social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make community-driven hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a new boom in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
New York babysitter sues couples for dismissal after 'racist' message
A New York grandchild sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother, who complained that she was “just a black person.”
The couple rejects the fact that they are racist, and compares the lawsuit to “expression.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-year-old mother, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up to her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEII ENDS A BLACK PERSON,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the loss, it was an “uncomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman who resigned Maurice, claiming that their abandoned childcare worker, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice got paid for his one day work and was then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the pair for compensation for the termination and demands compensation in the amount of $350 per day for the six-month, losji-based arrangement she was promised, but without a contract.
“I wanted to show them that – hey, you just don’t,” she told the New York Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have turned back on the accusations that they are racist and say Maurice's resignation was the only right, since they did not feel they could trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," the man told the New York Post.
“But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, come on."
The comparison of the lawsuit with “expression” says Plasco was due to the fact that his wife had only two months to term and was in a “very difficult situation”.
Is that the kind of person you want to punish?
It's not very nice," added the stock broker.
While the legal case goes its way, the popular court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
Paddington’s publisher feared readers would not accept a talking bear, reveals new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to sit in the place of others when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very funny to know what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She says her father, who had worked as a cameraman in the BBC before he was inspired to write the children’s book by a little teddy bear, would have been delighted that his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release was “bittersweet” after he passed away last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important family member” and adds that her father was secretly very proud of the success he achieved.
“He was a rather quiet man, and he was not a proud person,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child doing a feat: you’re proud of it even if it’s not really your fault.
I think he considered Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give Paddington his own honor."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say it looked bad, that he didn’t think she would survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got the phone from Nad that said she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my friend.
I'll see you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicine doctors had given her to get the heart to beat, slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs in her body folded together.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it happened.
I couldn’t scream and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers – who did not know about the trials she was going through.
“No one knew,” she says.
“I looked down all the time and my tears ran into a steady stream.
It’s hard to explain, but that’s where on the plane I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards with grieving women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers folks can call for help.
Sharon's son, Tyler, was 13 when he suffered from depression and died when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day,” she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him with a smile.
They said his smile could brighten up any room.”
He quit his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother was one of those who found him after he took his life.
Sharon says, “I worry all the time that there will be an infectious effect.”
Sharon made the cards “to tell people that there are people out there that they can go and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
Don’t sit down for yourself – you have to talk to someone.”
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost her partner Mark through 15, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he was feeling down or depressed or anything,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed the changing mood.
On Christmas Day, he was completely in the basement – when the kids opened the Christmas presents, they didn’t get eye contact or anything.”
She says his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to fight through it: “There is a great hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to stand up and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread as FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could get some of what he asked for – a time-limited and scope-limited investigation – we might come to a certain agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee “fell apart” along fixed party boundaries.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The opposition was due to the timing.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, November 6 – if Republicans are likely to do badly, it will be significantly harder for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called senators and ran lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double vote and get him in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'falls' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea’s assembly ministry, said there had been 1,127 rebounds last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices among human traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Most defectors from North Korea will eventually be offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China views the defectors as illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them with power.
The relationship between the North and the South – which is technically still at war – has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks on the tightened negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. sanctions for lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we will unilaterally rust down first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Minority leader of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the sentiment that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes almost screaming and was gruesome when he talked about his family and the years of high school.
He was also strongly condemning the Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated character killing” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony shows he can't sit in the Supreme Court because it shows he's biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks the Clinton couple and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I want to say this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he’s not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he’s sitting in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals (Court of Appeal).
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abortion rights), since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the inquiry, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would override certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time to send a hysterical, biased person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it,” Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It’s a fair rage, months and years where the mind takes over, and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that weird, do you?”
She continues: “I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she was also crying when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just continued.
And I thought it was amazing.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for harm partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs was in a man-dominated office. I started crying with inexplicable rage and got caught in the neck of an older woman – a cool boss that I had always been a little afraid of – who took me to a stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sorry and be happy because they managed to take you.”
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be cheating on her husband on board a boat called Monkey Business and pulled out of the election, Schroeder became very frustrated and thought there was nothing in the way to investigate the possibilities of running as a presidential candidate himself.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she said with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last ones they needed were another one.
Some called it “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since it was closer to the end of the campaign, she was left with funding and swore she wouldn’t quit if she didn’t get in $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“They think I’m getting a discount, don’t they?” she asks.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings—thankfulness to the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to push in money and reach voters instead of delegates, as well as anger at sexism—that she fell into tears.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalls Schroeder about how the press referred to her.
“You would think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking mon believe what they would write on my funeral aid?
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening ointments in the US-China trade war were deafening, and even though the fight is far from over, a rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The main escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, which means tariffs on half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has, of course, repaid every time, at the latest with a five to ten percent surcharge on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match U.S. attacks for attacks, and the world’s second-largest economy will probably not raise the white flag with the first.
Getting Washington to step down means giving in to demands, but public submission to the United States will be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the United States can give a positive outlook for China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that initiate economic ring effects in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the viewers have realized before,” said Abigail Grace, a research fellow who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to restore the country, which has been razed after more than 7 years of war.
Speaking at the UN National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress in combating terrorism,” he said.
The state continues to rebuild the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now conducive to the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country, who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the uprising would not be accepted.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe have won the 2018 Ryder Cup after beating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the team of Danish team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn received the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled during much of the tournament, injured his tee strokes in the water at par-3 16th hole, and had to see himself beaten by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant on all his rounds and became 1 of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind him, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the tournament’s most-winning Europeans through his time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t quit.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I am very, very happy to get the cup back.
It’s about the team and I’m glad I could be of help,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He leaves the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed that man closely as he grew up,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career points in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA spent the weekend finding the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-precision golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
It was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves away.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were beaten.”
