Is it a boy or a girl?
It's not the blues that are long gone.
The man ate the bread.
I'd rather have Judas in my hand.
There's a man at the door who wants to talk to you.
Would you like to see it today?
He couldn't have done any better.
The Italians were ashamed of it.
You've been invited to go to Australia for the summer.
You shouldn't go out.
Hello, how are you, my friend?
I'm not a judge.

I'm going to be squeamish.
Thomas will give it to us.
The man is high.
Thomas has a son and a daughter.
It's the good free.
Betty is dead.
They took Tom.
My family is fine, you're welcome.
That's more than Thomas expected.

He's the one who's here today.
How old are you?
He made the same mistake again.
It's like the time of snow.
Who's the loser?

I promise I'll be back soon.
I'm not afraid of between.
The bread is good for the bread.
I know I don't know.
It's a good new year!
"Can we go there?" he asked, "and you'll be fine."
The whole thing didn't go to sleep, but two didn't go to sleep.
They're talking to each other.
"What have you got?" "I've got two prophetic books."
There's a man at the door who wants to talk to you.
I hope it will be good.
It's not right.
What's the best color for you?
His son is in college now.
They're going to work very hard in the field.

They're talking.
I have only one wish.
There are five in the small town.
Thomas said to me, "I have not seen Mary's countenance."
I'm looking forward to getting married, but I don't want to marry him.
The sun was shining in the morning, but it was very cold.
Were you there?
It's all Heather's fault.
I'm sick.
I didn't believe my ears.
I need to help you.
The girl is in tears because the sun is shining brightly today.
There were only five of them?
Take it easy!
He was working hard on the front porch.
It's time to eat bread.
There is a street in Thomas.

I could've put a snippet on that.
I hope you've got love.
Look at the house.
I'm very busy.

You need it.
Do you think it's a complete waste of money?
Thomas met with Mary in 1972.
It was a sunny day.
There are others in the sea.
In your own opinion, and in your own opinion, where you are.
I'm sad, but I have to go home very quickly.
I'm going to walk around town in an hour. Would you like someone to come help me?
Two months later, Thomas began to study the French language.
I promise I'll be back soon.
I'm happy to meet you, my friend.

Good night.
Thomas is going down the stairs.
I hope it will be there.
