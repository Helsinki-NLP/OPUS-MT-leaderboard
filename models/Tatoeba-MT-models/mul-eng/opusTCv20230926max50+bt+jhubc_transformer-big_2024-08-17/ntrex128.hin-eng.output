Welch's AM (Constitutional Member) is concerned about 'images like carpet'
Among some members of the Legislative Assembly, there is an obstacle to the suggestion that the title of their post should be changed to MWP (Member of Welsh).
The reason for this is that the Welsh Parliament has been planned by changing the name of the Assembly.
All the AMs involved in the scope of politics are concerned that it could make them laugh.
A lab worker AM said that his group was concerned about "not connecting it to Twp and Pwp."
For readers living out of Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A Played AM said the entire group was "not happy" and has suggested other options.
A Welsh political party said his group was "independent" about the name change, but he noted that the MWP could be mapped orally by small changes in words.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is exactly the same as that of the letter u in the Yorkshire English pronunciation.
With regard to the change in name, the Assembly Commission, which currently prepares a legal draft, said: "What is called upon the members of the Assembly to say, the final decision of any detailer in this regard will certainly be a matter of his own for the members."
According to the Welsh Government Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission was briefed on the results of the public consultation on the proposals in which the name of the Assembly was changed to Welsh Parliament and received much more support.
In the case of the title of AM post, the Commission supported Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the most supported MWP option was found in public advice.
Obviously, AM is suggesting a number of other options, but it's going to be quite difficult to get common consent for President Officer Ellen Jones, who hopes they will submit a legal draft for the change within a few weeks.
Other changes in the ways of work in the assembly in preparation for the amendments will also be included in the law making, including the format of the Rules and Committee System for the Invalidity of the AM.
AM will get the last vote on the question of what they should be called to say when debating on the construction of the law.
The people of Macedonia are going to not collect to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote for whether or not to make "Republic of North Macedonia" by changing their country's name.
The popular vote was called so that the neighbouring country could resolve decades-old dispute with Greece, whose name is also Macedonia, a province of which is a province.
Athens has long stressed that his northern neighbor country name tells about his province and he has also repeatedly objected to his membership talks in the EU and NATO.
On the name change, a rival Macedonian president of the People's Republic of Macedonia says he will reject the vote.
However, Prime Minister Zoran Zev as well as supporters of the vote have argued that the change in name is only the intention to join the EU and NATO.
Due to the decline of churches in Harlem, the number of hours of St. Martin's bells is decreasing
Mr. Adams said, "For the things related to history that I spoke to the elders, he says that at first there were times and times more churches at every turn."
"Today, it's all over."
He said there is a lack of time.
"Today's people's society is becoming in a different way,"" he said."
“Now it’s not like the living room in the neighborhood where people go every day.”
For the churches, they are concerned that spending on the money that can be sold by the property will not take longer than expected by the leaders, "and soon this money will run out or later they will come to the exact place from where they started."
He further added that the churches may have been converted into right-of-property apartment buildings in which people of all kinds live, which will not help to keep the remaining places of worship around them safe.
He said, "In these buildings, the fortunes of those who are buying houses built in them as property will increase, and thus a time will come when these churches will be completely shut down, for most of them will not be able to afford property.
In 1870, a decade after St. Martin, the Black Metropolis - Metropolitan Community of Harlem was created by the Gore people of the religious community before it became a community.
The original blue people of the Methodist religious society went into the 1930s.
These buildings were occupied by the white people of the religious community who used to worship at the places of worship around them.
On St. Martin, a white religious society under John Howard Johnson came into possession, which had led to the removal of shopkeepers on 125th Street, this place was the main place for shopping in Harlem, where people had to work.
The building was badly damaged due to a fire in 1939, but was started to play here hours after it was planned to be rebuilt by the followers of Father Johnson.
David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor of St. Martin, proudly called the work of playing an hour “opening doors of grace to the poor.”
The expert who played the hour in July described it as something like this: it's "a cultural heritage" and "a tremendous historical instrument".
Tiffany NG, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first hour played by white musician Dionysius A. Lind, who played a very large hour at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that no other person was placed in his place in St. Martin.
Whatever happened in St. Martin in the last few months has become a complex story of artisans and contractors, some of which have been appointed by the church's general leaders and the rest by the provinces associated with religion.
The Paris (patriots of the village) made up of common leaders on the vestry (where the goods of the puja are kept) became the right - in July the province was concerned that the province would not "request to fulfill the customs" for vestry. Even the tenants in the vestry were appointed
Some residents of the area complained about the lack of clarity on the part of the province.
Thirteen-year-old boy was injured in attack by a 13-year-old boy while trying to catch a cake
Officials say a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and injured him while he was holding a cake while sipping on the opening day of the labster season in California.
The attack took place near the beak of Encinitas before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel from San Diego's KSWB-TV said that on Saturday morning he was chatting with friends for about half an hour, at the same time yelling at him for help. He heard the voice of a boy and then he threw him out of the water with a group
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was excited to catch the cake, but then he felt that he was screaming, 'I'm cutting something!
I'm cutting something!"
Hammel said that when he saw the boy, he found that the boy's entire thigh had been broken.
Hammel said, “I put everyone’s voice to get out of the water: there’s a shark in the water!”
San Diego's Reddy Childrane Hospital, where he is said to be in critical condition, has hired a teenager.
The species of shark that attacked has not been identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gilles said in a conversation with the media that a few weeks ago a shark was discovered in the area, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Gils further stated that the upper spot of the victim's thrashing is seriously injured.
For the purpose of investigation and security, officials have blocked access between the Ponto of Casablanca and the Swamis of Asinitas for 48 hours.
Gils said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to go to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's beauty product experts will be appointed assistants to include department store-style Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
Despite the continued decline in sales of fashion goods and home goods, it is going to grow in the UK's 2.8 billion-pound beauty market with good quantity, these huge quantities of beauty products will be examined in 11 stores across the country, Yojha and so on.
The investment in the beauty is being made in the supermarket, which aims to find its place in the market after bringing the TV, microwave and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it will double its product offerings by bringing up to 3,000 products for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing products of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more opportunities with branded products found in the shop such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique makeup products, so that most products are vegan-friendly - this will increase its demand in small-sized retailers to some extent.
In addition, Perfume Retailer Fragrance Shop will also explore special facilities in two stores of Sainsbury's, the first of which was open last week in Croydon, South London and the second at Selie Oak, Birmingham at the end of this year.
More-than-more efforts are being made to increase people's visit to the online shopping and local convenience store, i.e. the daily amount of food sold in the supermarket.
Sainsbury's chief executive, Mike Koop, said that people like department stores on the outlet will come more quickly as the supermarket chain has more services and non-food exemptions than Aldi and Liddal.
Sainsbury’s is putting Argos’s outlet in hundreds of stores and two years ago, since it’s been bringing both channels, it has also opened several stores, which shows that the sale of stolen goods has been promoted and the deal has been more profitable.
In a previous attempt to bring beauty and pharmaceutical products back into the market by the super market had failed.
Sainsbury's had done business together with Boots in the early 2000s, but due to the way of division in incomes from drug stores in its supermarket, this mixed-yellow business had to be terminated.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold the 281 stores of the pharmaceutical business to Lloyds Pharmacy chain owner Celestio for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, after which a new strategy emerged.
Lloyds will play an important role in the scheme by adding La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores, as well as many of the best luxury skincare brands.
Sainsbury's Commercial Director, Paul Mills-Hix said: "We have changed the shape-color of our beauty products so that we can enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also added specially trained co-workers who will assist us in providing advice.
We have created the range of our brand in terms of each person's need and attractive environment and in convenient locations, which means that we have reached an attractive destination for beauty products that challenge the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones announces <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal to separate Holi Vilubi from his <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
With Marks & Spencer and ITV, TV presenter Holly Bilubi decided to separate from the 11 million-pound deal for the lifestyle brand business of Dragons star Peter Jones, who decided to separate her from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal.
Billy doesn't have time for his homeware and accessories brand Truly at all.
The two were compared to Gweneth Paltro's brand Goop.
This 37-year-old morning presenter announced his separation on Instagram.
Holly Biluby separated herself from her attractive lifestyle brand business at the last minute with Dragons Den's star Peter Jones - so that she could fully focus on her new best-in-class contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources have found that when TV Golden Girl on Tuesday at Keenam, Keenam and Keenam at Keenam, Keenam and Keenam, at a stressful meeting at the Jones business headquarters in Keenamshire, Keenam admitted that it is his new deal - at a price of 1.5 million - at a price of Rs.
The trade was being compared to Gweneth Paltro's brand Goop and was being considered for doubling the estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million to be given by Wilubi.
The 37-year-old announced on Instagram that she was separating from Truly, after which Jones left the UK to go to his one-holiday home.
A source said: "Hollywood's priorities were truly at the top ever.
It was to be considered his long-term future, which would make the brand a lot of progress over the next few decades.
His decision has shocked every person involved in this business. . . .
No one could be sure what happened on Tuesday, it was too close to starting.
The warehouse in Marlowe Headquarter has been filled with goods that need to be sold.
Experts believe that the UK’s richest star is likely to lose millions of dollars due to the company’s divergence from this morning’s presenter as it has also been investing heavily in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and homeware.
At the same time, it can also end a long friendship.
Bilubi's three children and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, the star cape, for the past ten years.
Willubi had started with the cap in 2016 and was associated with it as 52-year-old Jones chairman in March.
Baldwin's TV production company has a 40 per cent share of couples and Jones who spend vacations together.
Bilubi has now become the brand ambassador of M&S and will be placed in the place of Ant McPartlin to host I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
"We will not want to talk about their business case," a source close to Jones said last night.
"We've had a great conversation and then we've agreed"
He joked that the news media would keep commenting on him, some would consider him to be a "different job from the president" and would be much more positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump told his show in "News anchor" Voices.
"I didn't give up anyone."
Kim's interest after his first meeting in Singapore in June was in the second meeting, he said, a major step was taken by Trump in the first meeting to make North Korea nuclear-free.
But nuclear-free talks have been halted.
After more than three months of the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top political leader Re Yong Ho on Saturday told leaders around the world at the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea's "initially destabilizing" North Korea was not the "U.S. for the steps" of the U.S.
Instead, the U.S. has continued to put pressure on the restrictions, he said.
In Trump's rally speech, his much more optimistic approach was seen.
"We are engaged in building good relations with North Korea,"" he said."
"We were going to fight with North Korea.
That would kill millions of people.
Now our relationship has become very good."
His efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - including completing the rocket test, helping to free hostages and bringing the remaining U.S. troops back to their homes, he said.
At the same time, he defended his unusual approach in negotiating relations with Kim.
Directly pointing to the crowd in front of him, Trump said, "It's very easy to stay on the presidency, but 10,000 people out of the country are trying to join this area, we'll only have about 200 people to stop them."
An island of tsunamis and earthquakes hit Indonesia, hundreds of people have died, according to the report.
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told for the incident that they did not need them.
Despite the devastation of more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok, no national disaster was declared, as well as, a condition was also put in place to provide international assistance.
Ms. Sumbu said, "In some situations, unfortunately, they were clearly seeing it as they were not seeking international help, so it became somewhat more challenging."
Still, Sev The Childran visited Pulu by meeting with a team, but it has not yet been ascertained whether employees from another country can come here to help.
Spokesperson of the National Disaster Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation of Palu, who were seeing whether the international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the situations that come to Indonesia over and over again, it seems that there is absolutely no preparation for the outbreak of nature in this country.
However, in the hearing, shelters have been made for people suffering from tsunamis, but they are not like shelters perched on other beaches.
There has been a decrease in the siren of warning for tsunami in the tail, no matter how damaging the warning may be, it is likely to increase the damage to life.
Whether it's the best time to go for a walk or a hike, it's challenging to go to many islands in Indonesia.
It is always difficult to deal with natural disasters, such as the management of merchants and goods.
The victims of the earthquake are being brought to a hospital in Lombok for treatment which is far enough from the lungs and takes at least three days to reach here from the new disaster site.
President Joko Vidodo created the very bad infrastructure of Indonesia for his election campaign, and he spent enough money to make roads and railways better.
But, Mr. Joko's administration has been quashed due to lack of funds as elections are due to be held again next year.
There is also pressure on Mr. Joko from the communal tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim Majority have made the religious ideology more conservative.
More than 1,000 people died and more than ten thousand people became homeless, as the Christian and Muslim groups were fighting each other on the streets using guns, spears, and guns and other dangerous weapons.

The statue of Cromwell in front of Parliament recently became the most famous monument, it was re-introduced in ‘History’
Its expulsion would be ideal justice for the destruction of many of England's many cultural and religious arts, such as its Taliban, which were created by its hard-line Purinton followers.
But, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history" as "stupid."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the ongoing debate on the removal of relics, there was a complete fear that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
No order was given for the symbol of the English Civil War and neither Cromwell made it.
It may be wrong that Cromwell had given up on the works of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
According to Sir William Hemo Thorocroft, the best representation of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century idea and part of the history of a statue, which many still consider worthy of praise.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people respect Cromwell, perhaps because of this most people still know him as the protector of the Parliament standing against external pressures in the case of the kingdom at the end of the 19th century.
However, they are considered to be a very accurate representative, which has historically been the subject of debate.
It is clear that our nation has been developing since the conflict in the mid-17th century, and the statue of Cromwell has become a private identity in which a glimpse of a side of that division appears.
His achievements as Lord Protector are commendable and worthy to be remembered.''
Deadly pigs attacked Chinese farmers, causing the death of the farmer.
According to local media reports, in a market in south-western China, the pig attacked a farmer, causing the death of the farmer.
On Sunday, South China Morning Post reported that only his surname "Yuan" has been identified as the identity of the person, serious injuries were found on his body, he was killed in a pig-tailed pig-tail in the market of Liupansui, Guizhou province.
On May 30, 2005, a pig-eating farmer was preparing to vaccinate the pigs in a pig-bearing pig-bat in Xining, China.
He allegedly came to the market on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market with his Kazan, who lives in nearby Yunnan province.
The next morning, his Kazan died and it was found that the door of a pig-tail had been opened nearby.
He said that he showed a rather large male pig in a pig-tail whose mouth was bleeding.
According to the report, in a forensic investigation it was confirmed that a 550-pound pig attacked the farmer and killed him.
According to Guiyang Ivening News, his Kazan, nicknamed "Wu", said, "My Kazan's feet were covered with blood and completely injured."
The security camera footage showed that Yuan had come to the market on Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was recovered about an hour later.
The person who killed him by attacking the person was not of the swan yuan or his Kazan.
A market manager told Ewing News that the pig was kept closed so that it could not attack any person, though the police collected evidence to assess the spot of the incident.
The yuan's family members and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
However, there have been rare cases of people being attacked by pigs before.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband on their farm, causing the person to be seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig had attacked a Welsh farmer, at the time he was on his tractor, he attacked the farmer until his wife frightened the animal.
In 2012, an Oregon farmer attacked his pigs and killed him alive and made his own food, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that the pigs are not generally aggressive, but they can be "harmful" when the taste of blood is found.
"They're just playing.
They cut off their teeth and are very sought after...they are not meant to hurt you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
The storm caused heavy rainfall in the south-western United States due to the remnants of Rosa.
According to the forecast, the storm is becoming weaker due to the cold water going on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days due to Rosa, there will be flooding in northern Mexico and southwestern America.
According to Eastern Time, at 5 a.m. on Sunday, the air temperature in Rosa was recorded 85 miles per hour, it is a Category 1 storm, and it was located at a distance of 385 miles in the southwest of Punt-Uganda, Mexico.
It is hoped that Rosa will rise to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form a ridge above the ocean and it is moving towards the western coast of the United States. Since, Rosa on Monday, as a tropical storm, is not going to reach the Pacific Ocean, the Pacific Ocean is going to reach the Pacific Ocean, so the U.S.
In some parts of Mexico on Monday, 10 inches of rain will come due to rosacea.
After that, in the coming days, the moisture coming from the soil will bring heavy rainfall in the south-west.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, flooding of swamps and landslides in the desert.
Due to very high thermal humidity, the rainfall rate will be 2 to 3 inches in some places, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona, it is more likely.
The south-western part, especially in most areas of Arizona, is likely to have 2 to 4 inches of rain.
Due to the permeable nature of tropical rain, there can be a lot of flooding with bad conditions.
Taking into account the risk of tropical rain, it will be advisable to stay out of the low-level desert.
Due to heavy rains, the ghats can become risky rivers and the need for clouds as well as rapid winds in local areas will run and dust will blow.
Due to the upcoming drought, there will be a lot of rain locally in some parts of southern California coast.
It is likely to rain more than half an inch in total, due to which there may be some flooding of debris and a situation of landslides on the roads.
This will be the first rainfall of wet weather in the area.
On Monday and Tuesday evenings, before the rain gets more widespread, Sunday evening and Monday morning there will be some splash-in-the-wall tropical rain in Arizona.
There will be heavy rain in the fore corner on Tuesday and it will be till Wednesday.
Temperatures across the U.S. may change rapidly in October as the Arctic's weather gets colder at this time, but there is plenty of heat in tropical regions.
Sometimes, due to this low distance, there are unusual changes in temperature.
The unusual change in temperature in the central U.S. on Sunday is a good example of this.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa is about 20 degrees.
In the next few days, due to the upcoming heat, the weather will start to warm up and the heat will increase.
Most areas in the Central and Eastern U.S. are expected to warm up from October which could be a wider 80s in some areas of the northeast, ranging from the southern plains to the southern plains.
New York City's temperature could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than the average temperature.
According to our long-term climate forecast, we are getting the indication that there are plenty of opportunities to stay above the average temperature of Eastern U.S. in the first six months of October.
More than 20 million people have heard of Brett Cavanagh
On Thursday, more than 20 million people attended the Supreme Court hearing of Brett Cavanagh and the woman who has accused Bret Cavanagh of sexual abuse, allegedly committed in the 1980s, the woman's name is Christine Chavez.
Meanwhile, political opposition was also seen, broadcasters blocked Friday's last-minute tweet: An incremental engineer by Arizona Sen's regular program. The FBI's Jeff Fleck filed a case against him a week later.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely sure that at a high school party, Kavanaugh had tried to get him drunk and toss his clothes.
Kavanaugh, defending himself, said he was absolutely sure that this had not happened at all.
More than 20.4 million people are likely to have seen this report from Nelson on Friday.
The company was counting average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News channels and MSNBC.
The data for the other channels that show it as well as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not readily available.
In addition, Nelson usually has some difficulty in calculating the number of people he sees in the offices.
From this point of view, it is equal to the number of spectators of the playoff football game or the Academy Award.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News channel, which hosts are considering, has greatly supported the appointment of Cavanaugh, being ahead of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers present during the day's hearing.
The number of viewers on ABC was 3.26 million and it remained in second place.
There were 3.1 million on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC and 2.52 million viewers on CNN, Nelson said.
People were very interested in the hearing.
In the drama that took place on Friday, Flek was a central figure.
A statement was issued after the tenure of the office of the Liberal Republican in which it was said that they would raise their voices on behalf of Cavanagh, who came to the front of the cameras of CNN and CBS on Friday morning, at the time protesting the hearing of the protesting judicial committee.
When they were being called absolutists, at the time they were standing their eyes bent for a few minutes, it was seen live on CNN.
A woman said, "Come on, I'm standing here in front of you too."
"Do you think they're telling the country the right thing?"
They were told, "Have you been brought to power to make many women powerless?"
Fleck said a statement was issued by his office before the elevator was closed and said that in the hearing of the committee they would be able to keep their full word.
While the Judiciary Committee was advancing the nomination of Kavanaugh for the entire Senate, at that time the cable and broadcast channels were showing all things live even hours later.
But, Fleck said, he will do with full understanding that the FBI will look into the allegations made against the nominees next week, which are being urged by a minority Democrat.
Fleck had a conversation with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons about it.
After negotiating with Connies and several senators, Fleck made his decision.
Fleck liked the power very much, as it was clearly seen that without the approval of the cavalier of the inquiry, the Republican would not be able to get the vote.
President Trump has given permission for the FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister accused the critics of being 'politicised' about Brexit in a tweet.

Popokepetal volcanoes in the southern parts of the capital, Mexico, have been hit by lightning.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention (NCD) warned the citizens of Mexico that they were staying away from the volcano and said that 183 times in 24 hours gas and mercury have been detected.
The centre was observed on a number of shocks and explosions.
The photos posted on social media showed thin layers of ash coating car windshield in a neighborhood of the city of Mexico, such as Exochimilco.
In September 2017, the 7.1-magnitude earthquake had come to Central Mexico, since then geophysicists have focused on the increasing activity of the volcano which is 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital.

Police clash with separatists in Catalonia on the occasion of the Independence Vote Enversary
On Saturday, six people from Barcelona were arrested following a clash of freedom-supporting protesters with the riot police, and thousands of dissidents took part in demonstrations on the first anniversary of the ban on non-separatism in Catalonia.
A group of Nakabposh-backed separatists threw eggs and powder paint on the riot police, causing the road to become blackened, causing the people who usually came and went to trouble.
The police used their daggers to control the collision and later used handcuffs.
Freedom supporters groups chanted "no forgetting, no apology" for several hours, while union protesters chanted "Spain remained immortal" for several hours.
According to a local press report, fourteen people who were injured due to the demonstration were treated.
According to Madrid, the October 1 census, which is considered illegal, has been raising tensions in areas with independent views for a year, but those with separatist views in Catalonia were celebrating it.
Voters for freedom chose a very good way, although there were few people who strongly opposed the vote against segregation.
When police were trying to stop people from moving on to polling stations in the area between the clashes, about 1,000 people were injured last year, officials said.
The groups in support of the independence had stayed there all night on Friday to assist the National Police to stop the protest.
The performance was advanced, but he had to be forced to make a different decision.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narciss Terminus, had come to participate in the separatist protest with his wife, he said he did not see any possibility of being independent of Catalonia.
"Our best year was last year.
"I had seen my parents cheering by voting, but it seems like we're stuck now," he said.
Despite a small victory in the regional elections held in December last year, Catalonia’s independence-supporting parties have struggled to maintain influence with their many famous leaders this year, whether in self-revelation or in the absence of organized and self-reliance in the conservatism.
42-year-old mechanic Joanne Puig, who recorded the protest on her phone for police help, said the fighting between politicians from both sides had been stopped.
He said, "It's become much more stressful."
On Saturday, Orol Junquerres, one of the nine leaders of Catalonia, who has been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that they will fight in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Fighting the European elections as a candidate is the best way to return to democratic values and condemn the return we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.

Menga beat Livingston by 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal ensured Livingston's victory
Livingston, who is moving fast, said the club's manager, had given the Rangers a chance to take on Steven Garrard for only his second loss in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's strike made the difference that Gary Holt's side move equalled with the Hibernian in the second half of the match.
Gerard's side stayed one step away from winning this season's premiership and will face the leaders' hearts next Sunday, which are behind eight points.
Earlier, on Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, in the six-game division, Livingston has been consistently winning by bringing head coach Holt in place of Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston failed to show off his game to the visitor.
A lot of time before scoring, the hole's team had to go ahead, as well, because of their good game, the Rangers had many kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke the record, but was left behind by an attempt to score, then Alan Lithgo could only remain in the lead by making his best effort after the slip so that the goal could be completed in the header of Craig Halket.
The hosts had the opportunity to play against the Rangers, they knew they could put the visitors in difficulty on set pitches.
And because of that, he got a big shot.
Rangers got a free-kick and Livingston opened, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked to set up the Menga, who scored a touchdown and scored from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had strengthened their position, but the home defense failed and the goalkeeper was left behind to a considerable extent,
The pattern was also going on in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos insisted on serving on kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgo completely captured the game by flicking from the second Livingstone.
Crossings continued to come in the Livingston box and continued until the goal was scored, while two penalties were claimed after the challenge of the wicket, one of which was on the lead of Glen Middleton and the other on the handball.
Analysis of Livingstone's "extraordinary round"
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont has been included in Tony Macaroni's Arena
The extraordinary performance and results of Livingston.
For any person, they were the best, they have continued to raise expectations on this growing trajectory.
His playing style and personality have changed amazingly since his return from the top flight, but most of all goes to the way of the credit hole in which he has given the team a new form of lineup since his arrival.
There were a lot of great players.
Captain Hulket was the best player, he served brilliantly, while Menga confused Connor Goldson and who had Wahl behind him.
However, there was a lack of learning in the rangers.
The kind of good performance he has done many times under Gerard, he was less than his standard.
Their final ball was short - they had only been able to cut to their home side open once - and it was like some wake-up calls for Rangers, who kept themselves in the mid-table.
Welcome to Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Kolon.
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th) for breakfast, the smiles ended but no benefit.
This is the last day of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's controversial visit to Germany - the goal of which is to improve relations with NATO's allied countries.
He remained stuck in disputes over many issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's role in the EU.
After that, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an spoke about the construction of a very large new mosque in Cologne.
Outside of Turkey, this city is one of the areas where the most Turkish residents live.
Police stopped the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but several supporters had to swoop in nearby places to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Ardogan protesters - some of whom were also Kurdish - also chanted slogans, strongly condemned Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's policies and the German government's decision to welcome them into the country.
A division was seen among those welcoming the visitor in the two-way protest demonstrations, some of whom considered him a German Turkish hero and others insulted him by calling him a voluntary ruler.

Storm Rosa is at risk of rapid flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
After the storm hit the Arizona of Rosa, there has been a threat situation in tropical areas, but the full likelihood is long ago that it is the one that has the remaining capacity of this storm that can greatly impact the desert southwest.
The National Weather Service had already announced on Monday and Tuesday that Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City as well as the cities of South and East Nevada, South-Eastern California and South-Eastern California.
With the rain on Monday evening, it is expected that the rosacea from the entire Phoenix will go straight out on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service, which is based in Phoenix, tweeted, "Ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression since 1950!
Katrina (1967) Storm Aged was within 40 miles of the border."
Recently, the National Hurricane Center model has estimated that there may be up to 2 to 4 inches of rain in the Mogolon Rim of Arizona, as well as, it is also expected to be up to 6 inches.
Central Rockies and the Great Basin as well as other areas of the Desert Southwest are likely to have up to 1 to 2 inches of rain, as well as, it is also expected to be up to 4 inches.
Outside of areas that are at risk of rapid flooding, the rain wells of Rosa may prove to be dry in this area.
However, the flooding has become a subject of very serious concern, but there has just been a state of drought in the southwest which is likely to get much more benefit from the rain.
According to the U.S. Route Monitor, only 40 percent of the area in Arizona is very dry, it is the second-highest-grade dry," a weather.com report said.
First of all, the storm will pass through the market of Rosa Mexico from the California Peninsula.
On Sunday morning, the maximum air speed of the storm Rosa was 85 miles per hour, at which time it was 385 miles south of Ujenia, Mexico and it is still rising from a speed of 12 miles per hour to the north.
This storm is currently in the cold water of the peaceful area, due to which its power is decreasing.
Thus, it is expected that by the power of a tropical storm, a state of landslide in Mexico could occur on Monday afternoon or at night.
There is a possibility of heavy rain in some areas of Mexico, which may increase the risk of flooding.
According to "weather.com" report, "it is expected that the market may rain from California to 3 to 6 inches in northwestern Sonora, as well, as it is likely to be 10 inches."
Rosa will then be a tropical storm on Tuesday morning before reaching the Arizona border in the north-east direction, after which it will go south-east in Arizona and South Utah on Tuesday night.
The National Hurricane Center said, "Russia or its remaining parts are the most at risk markets of California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest where heavy rainfall is likely."
It is estimated that due to these rains, there is a threat to public funds from the rapid flooding and flooding of landslides in the deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.

Trump has called Kavanaugh's trouble angry with the Democratic Party.
In a rally in West Virginia, Trump said, "Judge Kavanaugh is a person who has been rejected by the Democratic Party's indecisive and defiant strategy."
Trump has said that the trouble that Kavanaugh is going through is the result of the Democratic Party's anger during his nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh cleared the Congress for the matter in which Christian Blasey Ford accused them of having sexually assaulted Kavanaugh in his teens several decades ago, while Kavanaugh has been raping Kavanaugh with Kavanaugh and Kavanaugh with Kavanaugh during the purge.
During the hearing, Ford also gave his testimony on the charge.
On Saturday, the President said, "The residents of the United States saw the quality and courage of being the best man in Kavanaugh that day."
To the crowd of supporters in West Virginia, he said, "To vote for Justice Kavanaugh is to vote for a person who is the most lenient legislator of our time, he can confirm the law and judge with the actual record of public service.
Talking about the importance of the Republican vote in the mid-term elections, the President referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh.
"Now there are only five weeks left, from the election that is most important to our lives.
I'm not involved in it, but I'm actually involved in it," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for all the candidates who are really eligible."
Trump said the Democrats are on a "resistance and deterrence" campaign.
A senior GOP ally told CNN that the first vote on behalf of the Senate in the nomination of Kavanaugh is set to begin on Friday.
Earthquakes in Indonesia: Hundreds of people are dying from tsunamis, the death toll rises
Officials said on Saturday that when a very large earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, high-altitude waves began to rise in the sea and at least 384 people died.
On Friday, a festival was being held on the beach of the city of Palu, where hundreds of people gathered, when six meters (18 feet) of high waves rose in the evening, causing the death of many people and all around them.
The tsunami came after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
Sutopo Puro Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) in Briefing in Jakarta, said, "Yesterday, when the risk of tsunami hit, the people present in the meantime were engaged in their activities and were not in a position to leave immediately."
"Sunami not only caused the death of the people, but also dragged the cars, logs and houses to the ground, covering the ground. Before attacking the beach, Sunami recovered from 800 km/h (497 miles/h).
Some people climbed the trees to avoid the tsunami and defended themselves, he said.
16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres in the village.
The images posted by the disaster agency showed that several buildings and shops have been destroyed, the bridge has been turned over and collapsed and a mosque has also been surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued in the coastal city on Saturday.
2.4 million people in the area have experienced a continuous earthquake.
Indonesia's agency for the Assemblies and Applications of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the capacity of the energy generated by the huge earthquake on Friday was the 200th atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima from World War II.
It is said that the geography of the city of Basa at the end of a long, narrow bay can increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho said in detail about the damage, saying it was "very appalling" and thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were damaged due to it.
The bodies of some people were trapped in the rubble of the buildings and 540 people were injured while 29 people have not been identified, he said.
Nugroho said the population and damage in the area called Dongala, located 300 kilometres (190 miles) north of Palu, near the centre of the earthquake, is likely to be very high.
Nugroho said the communication system in the Dongala was "completely damaged".
In a statement, Red Cross said more than 300,000 people were living here and were visiting the affected areas of its employees and volunteers.
It said, "It's a sad event from the beginning, but it can be even more terrifying."
On Saturday, the agency criticized the fact that if there was a tsunami coming in Palu, why was the information not given earlier, though officials said the warning was to be issued but the waves had already gone.
Make some videos by a person amateurly and post on social media in which it can be seen that the position on the upper floor of the building was giving a voice to a person on the street below and in it can be heard a terrible warning.
Within a few minutes, a lot of water began to come out of the middle and the buildings and cars were also pulled along.
The routers were not able to verify the footage immediately.
Due to the earthquake and tsunami, there was a problem of electricity in the lungs and communication lines were cut, making it difficult for officials to combine rescue efforts together.
With the help of Jakarta and other cities, officials have started sending cargo planes, officials said, still need to take people out and meet other requirements as well as food.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will close in October.
President Joko Vidodo was due to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia has risen to more than 800 as a result of the tsunami.
It's very scary.
Mr. Doseba said that the employees of World Vision located in Donggagala made every effort to make the city safe, the employees have been living in it by making the shelter of Tirpal in the prangana of their office, they have seen this tragedy with their own eyes.
He said, "When I spoke to him, he found out that he had seen many houses destroyed."
It's very scary.
Aid groups have started to take the task of bringing goods for disaster relief seriously, with some people complaining that external aid workers who have acquired special expertise are being denied entry into the fold.
According to the rules of Indonesia, the aid of money, any goods and employees from abroad can only be taken when the declaration of the disaster zone is made as a national disaster zone.
But, this has not been done yet.
Red Cross spokesman Ulia Ariani, who is based in Indonesia, said, "This disaster is still at the provincial level."
"After being told by the government that's okay, it's a national disaster, only we can involve international aid personnel in rescue work but it hasn't happened yet."
Even after the earthquake on Friday and the second night of Sunami, the people whose friends and family members had not been able to find out, they were hoping that their loved ones would find a miracle somewhere as happens after natural disasters.
On Saturday, it was found that a young boy was trapped in the sewer.
The rescue team on Sunday pulled a woman out of the wreckage and her child was trapped in the wreckage for two days.
Indonesian National Paragliding Team coach Gandon Subando trained two Asian game paragliders to identify the missing people, who had been dedicated to it since the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
M. Mandgi was also among the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel with his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I am also emotionally depressed,"" he said."
Mr. Gandon said that only after receiving news of Roa Roa Hotel's collapse did the paragliding community begin its work, they sent a message to the contestants participating in the mid-festival through WhatsApp.
However, only the grey marks on their message are visible, not the blue marks on it.
"I think that means that the message did not reach people,"" he said."

He tweeted on Saturday about the change: "Officially his name will remain Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has kept his name for a while and will use the name for the title of his eighth album, Monikar, which was released in June.
This change is being made in his presence in Saturday's Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yindi.
The show's creator said he has removed singer Ariana Grande from the show, who had refused to join the show for "emotional reasons."
As well as shortening his current professional name, West had already stated that this word has religious significance for him.
Speaking on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy earlier this year, West had said, "I admit that the word 'e' has been used many times in the Bible, and according to the Bible it means 'you'."
That's why I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
This word is taken from Kanye, which means only one, which is just this - it shows our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
We have been shown who we are on the album.
They are one of the many famous rappers who change their name.
Sean Combs also has a number of names, such as, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has kept his name Love and Brother Love when announcing the name.
An old friend of the West, Jay-Z (JAY-Z) has also changed his name with or without the hyphen and big letters.
Mexico's AMLO has vowed not to use the army against unarmed citizens, says the report.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed to never again use the U.S. military if he completes the country's 50th anniversary of deadly persecution against students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised in Telt<0xC3><0xA1>lco Plaza on Saturday that "the military will never be used to put pressure on the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot dead more than 300 people on the peaceful movement taking place in the plaza, at a time when the left-wing student movement was spreading throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has promised to help the young people of Mexico, they will give scholarships to the students who read each month and open more-than-free government universities.
Because of the low chances of getting unemployment and education, young people are among those who commit crimes, he said.
The U.S. should double the funds to be given to A.I.
“As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double the amount of research spending to be done in this area,” said Kai-fu Lee, an investor and AI entrepreneur who has been downgraded to Google, Microsoft and Apple.
After several work by the U.S. government, AI has commented, he also said that there is a lack of overall formal AI strategy in the U.S.
Meanwhile, last year, China launched a plan: its goal is to reach No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
Lee said, "AI research will get a good start by doubling the budget, looking at different other countries, so the U.S. is a long way behind this case, and we are trying to achieve AI's next success."
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said, "By doubling the fund, it may be twice as likely that AI's next big achievement will be in the U.S."
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by the Houston Mifflin Court this month, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, they are one of the best AI companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University he had worked on an AI system that left the highest-ranked American Othello player far behind, and later they served as an executive in Microsoft Research and as president in Google’s China branch.
Lee explained better the technical skills of the previous U.S. government, which included the robot-related challenges of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and said that he would be the next government to identify the next visionary.
Lee said that U.S. researchers often have to face a lot of difficulties in getting government help, he said.
Lee said, "It's not China that removes academic leaders, it's corporate."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have appointed giants from the university to work on AI.
Lee said the U.S. can get help in its AI efforts by making a change in immigration policy.
He said, "In my view, permission to do Ph.D. in AI should be obtained by means of a green card."
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its NEXT Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (AIDP).
Lee said, "China's National Natural Science Foundation has given financial donations to the people of the Academic Institute, in the same way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations don't give financial donations to the researchers of the U.S., but to the people of Kashken in China.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense opened a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House has selected Artificial Intelligence for the Kitesurfing.
In addition, this month, the DARPA launched an initiative in the name of AI NEXT in which it spoke of an investment of $2 billion.
For the NSF, currently this investment is more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, a law was made in the U.S. that the demand for the creation of a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence would be ignored for months.

On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted to change the name of the country to "Republic of North Macedonia" or not, it is a work that will resolve the decades-old dispute with Greece, due to the fact that the stags in the stags, the stags, and the stags in the stags
There is also a province in Greece called Macedonia, he said, whose northern neighbor's name is on his territory which has two names for the same claim and he is already involved in NATO and the European Union.
Both governments made a deal in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents opposed it and said the name change of Macedonia would weaken the racial identity of the majority of people living in Slavik.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not go to vote in the assembly and exclude the campaign, he has cast doubt that at least 50 per cent of the votes necessary for this vote will be valid.
The question will be written on the ballot: "Do you give your approval to the agreement with Greece for NATO and EU membership?"
Supporters associated with the change of name along with Prime Minister Zoran Zev say it is important for Macedonia to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO, it is one of those countries that has emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, it is for young people in Macedonia, so they will be able to live independently in the EU's umbrella,"" said Olivier Georgijevska, who lives in Skopje."
However, it is not being pushed for it legally, most members of Parliament say they will work according to the results of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority is required in Parliament for the name change.
The State Election Commission said no information of irregularities was received till 1 p.m.
However, when the last parliamentary election was held in 2016, the vote was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent, with 66 per cent of registered voters voting.
Gozo Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter living in Skopje, said, "I had come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe."
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zev, along with his wife Zorica and son Dushko, voted in Macedonia to change the country's name with his son Dushko, so that on September 30, 2018, the country's name in Stromika, Macedonia will be in the hands of Nato and the European Union.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kvardarkov, who lives in Skopje in front of Parliament, was preparing a small stage and those who are opposed to this vote were putting chairs in front of their installed tents.
"We need NATO and EU membership, but we want to get involved in it by raising our heads, not through an agreement," Kavdarkov said.
"Our country needs the poor, but we also have our own dignity.
"If they don't want to give us membership in the name of Macedonia, no matter what, we can become part of the Euro-Asia integration by connecting with other countries like China and Russia."
Prime Minister Zev has said that Macedonia will get a very important investment by getting membership in NATO, the unemployment rate here is more than 20 per cent.
After voting, Zev said, "I think there will be a lot more voting positivity because more than 80 per cent of our citizens agree to join the EU and NATO."
He said that "yes" will result in "confirmation of our future."
A survey published by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research on Monday found that 30 to 43 per cent of voters will take part in the crucial vote.
A second survey conducted by Telema TV in Macedonia on Sunday found that 57 per cent of people are planning to vote.
Of those, 70 percent agreed to vote yes.
More than 50 per cent of the vote is necessary to be successful.
If the vote fails, the policy of the Western government, which will be formed in May last year, will be the first serious blow.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguaro forced to defend the whole of Britain to round up the rounds
On Saturday, Sirgio Aguero and Rehim Sterling made a strong defence against Britain in the 2-0 win over Manchester City, England at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester City.
Funnyly, Aguaro made his easy goal in the 65th minute.

When he landed in the open field, he defended against three British players.
After that, Aguaro found himself surrounded by four opposing players.
He pushed a player who defended before moving forward from the corner of the Brighton Boxes.
Then, looking for Sterling, he sent a pass to his left.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguaro, Aguaro beat British skipper Matthew Ryan by using his left boot, and the ball went out of their right and into the net.
The city manager, Pep Guardiola, told the reporter, "There have been some problems in Aguaro's legs that make him upset."
"We talked 55, 60 minutes on their game.
The same thing happened.
We were very pleased that they scored at the same time."
But, it happened because of the starling that gave Skye Blues an early advantage in the Premier League encounter.
He scored a goal in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguaro got a ball-dip in the Brighton area.
He pulled the ball out beautifully from the left side of LaRoy Sen.
Before sending away a good playing starling, Sen did a few touch-ups.
Just before the game's hand slipped, Skye Blues tapped the ball forward.
The Champions League group playoffs will now take place on Tuesday at 12:55 pm Sinsim, in Rhine-Neker-Erina, Germany.
They're going to beat him by playing against the Rockies.
After the end of the playoff dispute with the Nationals, there was no big reason to stress for any other starter.
But, the ever-competiting Skager is hopeful that he will make a big score on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but the playoffs for the Rockies are still just a possibility, he's with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
On Friday night, Rockies scored a wild-card spot by winning 5-2 at the Nationals, but they are still looking to get the first division title.
"Although we're not very good at playing, we can at least play to know that the atmosphere of the crowd and the second team of Denver will be for the highest level game I'm going to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play that game?"
The Nationals still have to tell us about the starter for Sunday, but are coming to hear that in such a situation the Shezar can be included.
Shezar, who plays for his 34th start, took the risk of a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch on his narmal on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander stood at 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia.
Speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm election, the President referred Brett Kavanaugh to the position surrounding his Supreme Court.
"All the work done by us will be on the right in November.
It has now been only five weeks for the most important election of our lives.
"It's a very big election - I'm not involved in it, but really I'm involved, because I'm fighting for all the great candidates," he said.
Trump added, "You can look at this much more terrible hard-hitting group of Democrats, you can see all the things that are happening right now.
In addition, they are trying to wield power by using other essential means, about which you know that it is useless and useless.
To get power and control, they don't care who's sad, who's capable of it, they just want power and control here to get them, but we're not going to let that happen."
"Democrat's campaign is to 'resist and block'.
"In addition, you can see what has happened in the last four days, the anger of the Democrat you've seen and it's also seen how meaningful and bad they are."
He referred to the name of Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was strongly praised by the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Did you delete the document?
What?
No, no, I'm waiting for that thing - whose body language was really very bad - such a bad body language I saw for the first time."
Working is no longer a broad church.
It is not for those who speak their mind to endure it.
When my local party was voted on by the activists to elect me, it was a big surprise for me.
After all, I am the newest among those Labour MPs whose importance has remained quite low - we cannot say the whole thing to our minds.
My MP also happened here with fellow MP Joan Ryan because he had also raised the voice for the non-socialism.
In my case, Sensor Motion condemned me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
Responsibility for the importance of the economic policy, for national security, had similar problems in Europe in a way that Jeremy disagreed with the senior leaders.
"We want all things to be included in the meeting and these things to be beneficial," he told the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday.
During my eight years as a local Labour MP, I mostly saw here that Friday Night GC meetings were exactly the same.
The sad thing is that today there is no consensus in many meetings and or it is promised that the politics of the “smart and lazy people” is really forgotten, here too.
It is clear that if the views are different in the Labour Party, they are not tolerated and it is decided for every consideration whether or not this party is fit for leadership.
Soon after becoming the leader of Jeremy, for whom I had previously thought that they hold a political opinion like mine, they began to expect me to turn away from my words and work on the positions with which I could never agree - whether that was the case.
Whenever I raise a voice for the public - and it really doesn't matter what I said - I get bad words on social media, there's a sharp remark on it, the center's politics is condemned and I'm told that I'm not a Labour Party
Besides, it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more vocal than some of my colleagues because my comments are related to politics.
I know about the way businesses work and I am committed to those colleagues who always face gender-related or racial misconduct, but don’t back down from raising voices.
There are many disappointing aspects in today’s political era, one of which is how to make levels of abuse normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn claimed that it is essential for the Labour Party to promote a culture of unhappiness.
The reality is that we are no longer the Broad Church and every proposal of "unbelief" or change in the party's selection rule has become very minor.
Over the past two years, many people have advised me and urged me to remain silent, not to speak too much and then I will be "considered right."
But I didn’t come to politics for that.
32 years ago when I was associated with work as a school student, I was encouraged to oppose the Thackeray government, I was told to leave my school’s broad class completely, I asked them to provide better public services or to re-evaluate those who are most likely to be in need of government
I have never concealed any of my politics, including the politics of the last election.
There is no one in Nottingham East who has any doubts about my policy position and any area of disagreement about my current leadership.
I would like to say to all those who promoted the proposal on Friday that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that is hurting homes, businesses and our public services, I do not waste my time and energy in showing my honesty to the Labour Party.
But, actually, I have a message that is not for the Nottingham Momentum, it's for my supporters, whether they're Labour Members or not: I'm proud that I'm serving you and I promise you that there's no real risk or political provocation in my work.
Chris Leslie Nottingham is an MP from the East.
Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Reaching the top of the undefeated air
The two attempts made late may have had some impact on the final result, but there is no doubt that the Air Tenant's premiership was entitled to a win in this best entertaining match.
Now they are at the top of the table of only ten undefeated sides.
After all, his defense was as good as the chances they could find, which led him to move the domestic team forward and give Coach Peter Murchi a chance to be happy.
"We have thoroughly examined our game and we are still undefeated, so it makes me happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "This goes to the credit Iir, who missed his opportunity as much as possible."
In the 14th minute of Grand Anderson's effort, the fresher Klimo had to face Ear, but the Scottish player Rory Hughes was given a yellow card by the Warriors, which gave Melrose a chance to score and Jason Baige gave him a chance to score.
With the help of penultimate just before half-time, Klimo increased the score, he scored and then tried to unify the match from 17-5 for the break time.
But Melrose was better in the second half and Patrick Anderson's effort was turned into a goal by Baggot, which reduced the five-point lead.
After that, Ruridih Nott was seriously injured due to which he had to stop the game for a long time, he had reached the stretch, then after the start of the game Air went on to try through Stanford McDowall. Klimo switched to the goal.
At the time, the captain of the Air team, Blair McFarson, had received a Yellow Card, and after that, due to a lot of pressure at the end of the game, Melrose gave an attempt to extra-man Bruce Calvin who was unable to knock him out.
However, the host team stayed behind and when Stroan Hachisan was given a yellow card due to facing Bill Ball's climax from the penalty line-out, McFarson dropped the ear by raising the ear from the back.
After Kelly Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box-kick and sent away Flanker Greger Henry for the fifth attempt of the home side, Klimo turned it into a goal, as they could when the game restarted.
The star of the game is still looking for a new career in the restaurant industry.
The game's star Ford Kieran is still looking for ways to go into the hospitality industry, some time ago it was discovered that he was selected for the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack is involved with the famous BBC show, in which he works writing and is already co-starring in the acting of comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Both have said that their last series in the world of the upcoming Ninth Series show will be, and it seems that Kiernan is planning what to do after the Cragling.
Based on the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmoren Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, yet it was hinted from a Scottish sound source that he wanted to join a "great restaurant trade" located in Kiernan Glasgow.
'Our right to the sea': Land-restricted Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way for peace
Army-Navik La Paz is marching on a large scale in Naval Headquarters.
Osian-blue flags are being flown on government buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the naval base has a slogan: "We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to get it back."
Bolivia, which lost to Chile in the terrible struggle for land in the 19th century, is still desperate to find its land - they once again want to take their bait in the Pacific Ocean.
Now they expect the latter to be able to regain the land of their Bolivia decades ago, as it is waiting for a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"There's a lot of joy in Bolivia now, there's a sense of unity and peace here, and there's going to be a positive outcome in the hope of the people here."
Many people in Bolivia will see the big decision of the ICC on the big screen across the country, they fully hope that the decision that will come from the Hague Court will be in favor of Bolivia - on which the talks have been going on for decades - Chile has conspired to negotiate through the talks.
Bolivia's best President Evo Morales - who is going to face a controversial contest in the re-election next year - has also expressed his optimism in Monday's rollout.
Last August, he said, "We are very close to getting back to the Pacific Ocean."
But, some analysts believe that the court's decision will not be in the interest of Bolivia - and if the decision is also in its interest, there will be plenty of conditions.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the right to award the Chilean province, and it has decided that the possible outcome of the talks will not be determined.
The decision of the ICJ is to come six months after the final discussion, which is to be followed by a signal from what has been heard that the case was "not conclusive", said Paz Zratt, an expert in the International Court of Justice in Chile.
Apart from that, unlike the terms of Bolivia, it seems from the last four years that it may come back into the old condition.
"The issue of access to the sea has been blocked by the current government of Bolivia,"" Jarrett said."
He suggested that Morales' controversial statement has put an end to Chile's remaining sympathies.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate on some terms, but it will be very difficult to negotiate this time after the decision.
Since 1962, the ambassadors of the two countries have not been living in each other's country.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, who is present in the Hague, has denied that the court's decision was unusually somewhat swift.
He said that on Monday there will be "the best opportunity for Bolivia to open the way for new relations with Chile" and it will be "the opportunity to end 139 years of disagreements on mutual benefits."
Kailashila has dismissed the fact that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - was politicizing the maritime problem.
"Bolivia will never back down for its right of access to the Pacific," he said.
"The decision is an opportunity to go about what we needed to do in the past."
North Korea has said that nuclear surveillance will not be stopped until it trusts the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ree Yong Ho has said his nation will not destroy its nuclear bomb until it has confidence in Washington.
Ree gave a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He told the United States that he would fulfill the promises made during the summit held in Singapore among the leaders of the other country.
He added that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be resuming nuclear diplomacy after more than three months of talks in Singapore, North Korea's Kim Jong-un.
Ree said it is a "pipe dream" that would be considered a North defeat by restrictions and U.S. resistance to declare an end to the Korean war.
Washington is wary of the agreement of the already important decommissioning campaign that is underway without Pyongyang's announcement.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump both want another summit to be held.
But, it’s entirely suspicious that Pyongyang is serious about ending the nuclear bomb surveillance because they don’t want to put the country’s security at risk.
Kim-Trump is planning to go to Pompeo Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit, which will be the wish of both sides.
The Paris Fashion Show features a variety of new headwear with a new design for your next high street.
If you need to increase your hat collection or completely save your head from sunlight, then you don’t need to wait any longer.
Both Valentino and Thomas Brown have created a series of the finest headwear for their SS19 collection on the runway that will be featured in the famous Paris fashion show of the special style.
The best Featherman hats are made to avoid this year's heat and these designers have sent their beautiful creations to show on the show.
The best hats made by Valentino were quite large, decorated with a wide brim like wings that hung squarely on the model's head.
The second accessory with a much larger side included waterproof hats made of beige design, vizard hats and pinapple design hats - but they aren't made to protect your head from frost.
Tom Brown also showed a face with a special kind of design - and these can only be used in time for Halloween.
Seeing many colorful faces, people were surprised and saw things such as the more significant lighter than the house-coucher.
In one creation, all kinds of objects were seen for scuba diving which included snobs and glasses, while in the other creation was seen an ice cream cone design.
In addition, if you've seen a bigger fashion - then you're likely.
It's estimated by the style-seeing fans that this best collection can soon reach out to the nice shops around you.
The very large-sized hat will come with a ‘la bomba’ design helmet, which can be bought by everyone from two-foot wide-brimmed straw hat release to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the best-performing hat that seemed pretty beautiful was shown with the second creation catwalk posted on social media - showing the model wearing a swimsuit on a straw-beach bag.
Burnt Orange Rafia bag was trimmed with Rafia Fringing and fitted with a white leather handle, which was the best attraction of Jacques La Rivera SS19 collection in Paris fashion Week.
"Fashion's famed celebrity Luke Armitage told the email: ""I hope big hats and mid-bags will come soon for the upcoming summer season - because the designers have made such an impact on the fashion industry,"" he said."
John Edward: It is important to have language skills for the citizens of foreign countries
The private school of Scotland keeps an eye on the track record of the best education, and since 2018 it has continued to give the best test results, making it a personal and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland are affiliated with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), under the leadership of which these schools are trying to provide the best service to their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and their places are benefiting the citizens of foreign countries.
As an education sector, which can build and implement the school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages in schools continue to be chosen as an option for the popular and desired topic.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in the language that makes him understand, you become the best for him.
If you talk to him in his language, it feels very good to his heart."
When we want to build a relationship and trust the people of other countries, we feel that we can rely more on English.
In the recent test results of this year we can see that languages with the highest pass rates in private schools are at the top of the league table.
Of those, 68 per cent are students who have received the highest grade A in foreign languages.
The data collected by 74 members of SCIS can be seen in the data collected by schools. 72 per cent of students received the highest grade A in Mandarin language, while 72 per cent of students received in German, 69 per cent of students received a certificate in French and 63 per cent in English.
This shows that Scotland's private schools are cooperating in foreign languages, giving children and young people the necessary skills they will need in the future.
Languages are now being included as an alternative subject, as are the courses of private schools and other things, like STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
The survey conducted by the UK Commission for Application and Skills in 2014 found that employers struggled hard enough to appoint employees on vacant positions, with 17% of the candidates who had language skills shortages.
Therefore, it is becoming mandatory for young people to have more and more language skills to prepare them for their future careers.
Because of the more potential employment opportunities that the language needs, these skills are needed to work anywhere in the world.
Why not choose any option for a career, if people have learned any other language, then such skills will necessarily benefit them in the future.
If you are able to speak directly to foreign people, you will become yourself in the competition due to being a multilingual person.
In 2013, more than 4,000 adults in the UK participated in the YouGov survey, according to which 75 percent of people could not speak enough in a foreign language and only French was the topic that 15 percent of people could speak and reach a double-digit percentage.
That’s why it’s important for children to invest in language learning today.
Many languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will be able to provide children with a better chance of finding the right jobs by being aware of them.
The languages taught in each school in Scotland will be different from one another.
There are also a lot of schools that will focus more on classic modern languages, while other schools will teach those languages whose approach is towards 2020 and are considered the most important for the UK. For example, Mandarin or
No matter why your child’s interest in learning any language, they will always be able to choose that language in private schools and they will also find the teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scotland's private school is dedicated to providing an educational environment that will prepare children for the future and give them the skills they need to succeed, enabling them to move forward in the future.
The fact that learning languages in the country for the future is very important for the global business environment cannot be ruled out yet, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be accepted as an "international communication skill."
Young people of Scotland will continue to be given the option of choosing this option, diversity and excellence by private schools.
We have to do it right.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools is headed by John Edwards, the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
On Sunday in San Diego, LeBron started as part of the Lakers
Now the wait time for LeBron James fans is about to be over as they are going to play their first game for the Los Angeles Lakers very soon.
Leckers coach Luke Walton has announced that James has been selected as the Prestige Opener to play against Denver Naggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it remains to be decided how many minutes they will play.
Leckers said through the official website, "They will play at least one minute and more-than-48 minutes."
Lackers spokesman Mike Trudel tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After the exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six games of the Lakers' Precious Schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to be prepared for the preseason game."""
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump held a large number of rallies for the campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia last night.
Next week, Trump has set five more rallies, including Tennessee and Mississippi, as well as other friendly venues, he said.
With the impeachment of the Supreme Court for his appointment to the vacant post, the purpose of Trump is to seek assistance for mid-term election as it is to get out of control of the Congress at the time of the count of votes in November.
When will Trump's rally in West Virginia be held tonight and how will you be able to see it online?
The timing of Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is set for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can watch Trump's rally on-line in West Virginia via live stream on YouTube.
Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh may give a speech at this week's hearing, as Trump has confirmed a week-long Senate vote on charges of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh during the probe into the FIT.
But, the main objective of this tense situation of the rallies is to help the republican to face the elections that will take place in November.
According to Reuters, thus, President Trump during the campaign said, "Next week, the goal of these five rallies is to defend and increase the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives in the form of the Republican effort to protect and increase them in the form of proxies."
According to Reuters, the spokesman, who has been removed from Trump's campaign, said, "Congress control has become so important to his agenda that the president will only visit those states where our campaign season will be very busy.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, "The attention of supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania from tonight's rally, set at the Wheeling's Wesbanko Arena, can be brought to the Pittsburgh media."
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, where he received more than 40 per cent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is coming forward to try to help Patrick Morris, a candidate who is behind in the West Virginia Republican Senate's poll.
According to Reuters, political scientist Simon Hayder, from West Virginia University, said, "If efforts to give Morris a boost in the election are being made to the president, this is not a good sign for them."
Rider Cup 2018: Team USA has shown a desire to compete so that the expectations of staying at the top of the Sande singles can be maintained
After three one-sided sessions, the fourth session will result in what will happen in this rider cup on Saturday afternoon.
The passage of time cycle is a completely new concept for players, but it can't be estimated when who the player is going to step up and who the player is going to be trusted in, in such competitions as these.
So, what are they going to say about this moment now?
"He had an increase of six points that has now stayed four, so I think we'll have to increase our pace a bit," said Jordan Spit.
Of course, Europe got the benefit and progressed from 12 points in the game to four points.
According to Spieth, the American feels that they have little-too many opportunities left and there is a lot to encourage, not only from Spieth's form but also from Justin Thomas's form, who played together all day and both got three out of their game.
Spieth is deadly to everyone from T to Green and is also the best in the game.
As they moved forward with their game, people were excited to play with loud cheers, when they and Thomas went down two more points after the two, making a significant jump to complete four all-squares.
Because of their putt, their team came in 15th position with the same screen, a short that tells you that you don't consider the American team out of it.
Spieth said, "You really just have to play well and keep in mind that winning is yours."
That's what they say to all the players who have gone out of the game.
18 holes to make a mark.
In the past two days, only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas, whose names are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, have been making new history in the Riders' Cup.
Europe's different but better couples have received four points out of four and are the most forwards.
"Moliwood" on Saturday afternoon was the only pair who didn't shoot a boggy, but he stayed away from the boggy on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning until 9 a.m.
On Sunday, he found a way to get the run and that run in this strong crowd and with this strong crowd as they are the players to beat, and there is no player who could change the potential win of the European team in the loss of the batting or the molinary.
It's good to have both on different holes in different ways.
However, the dignity of the Europeans is already well-established.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson made it a little easier for the hero Sergio Garcia of Forball in the morning, at the time their pair was made with Alex Noreen.
In front of the nine Dougs, one bogie and two doubles, the Spaniards and the Swedes were holed up, before they could ever even reach.
However, there was no one on Sunday to help you get to your hole.
Foreball and Forasam were very good at looking because the interaction between the pairing was quite good, they advised that they do not need to take advice and they are well-informed in the way of changing the strategy.
As a team, Europe played very well and took a significant increase in the last day, but this forum session also showed that the team has the ability to compete in a way that, especially in the stateside, is suspicious.
On the last day of the Riders Cup, Europe increased by 10-6.
Europe will benefit in a good way on the last day of the Rider's Cup after a 10-6 increase in the U.S. foreball and Forasm on Saturday.
The best pair, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, took a step up to the Tiger Woods fighting with two wins so they could take their match far ahead of the four points of the Golf National.
Two years ago in Hezlatine, Thomas Bij<0xC3><0xB6>rn's European side's Morning Foroball was dominated by the American side's fouling, which led to a 3-1 increase in the series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in Forsam by scoring in two matches, but they could not avoid losing.
To maintain the trophy win, Jim Furick's side needed eight points in Sunday's 12 singles match.
Fleetwood are the first European to consistently win four points, while he and Molinari had started from "Mollywood" after the sensational wicket, they are the second pair to have scored four in their first four matches in the history of the Riders Cup.
After losing Woods and Patrick Reed in the game, he again defeated the best player Woods and U.S. rookie Bryan Deshambu by 5 and 4 points while performing better than ever to lose.
Woods, who put himself ahead in two games on Saturday, has shown his best performance, but now he has faced 19 defeats in his 29 matches of the Foreball and Forasm and seven games of the Roe.
In the rest of the mornings, Justin will return to Forasm every day with his partner Henryk Stenson and beat the world's second-ranked three players Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copeca 2-1.
However, in the south-west of Paris, the pleasurable, breezy day had no break for Europe.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, set the benchmark for the U.S. by scoring two points on Saturday.
He won 2-1 on Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the match and sent Pauls and Rory McCleroy back by beating 4-3 in the opening two holes.
This has only happened twice in the history of the Riders Cup when a team came back from the match reaching the singles by getting four points, though the kind of side that was needed by the F<0xC3><0xBC>hreek was the one that caught everyone's attention in the trophy.
However, the counter-attack, which will take place on Sunday after being the second-best for two days, is going to be as different from their old game.
North Korea has said that by saying 'there is no way', de-escalation will be only one party that can't be trusted
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday the United Nations had continued the restrictions that depended on its distrust in the United States and had shown no way to let the country monitor the nuclear bomb on its own in such circumstances.
Re Yong Ho, in the Annual General Assembly of the World Body, said North Korea had tried several ways last year that were linked to "important ways of harmony", such as, nuclear bomb testing and missile testing, nuclear weapons testing, nuclear weapons testing, nuclear weapons testing
"However, we have not received any reply from the US for this," he said.
"Without confidence in the U.S. in any way, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation there is no way that we can start unilateral disarmament."
While Rei reiterated that the complaints made by North Korea are also about Washington's "committed" approach in view of the de-escalation, under which North Korea will gradually begin to benefit, his statement may not be entirely clear as to why this is so
At the summit between the U.S. President and the leader of North Korea, who first served in Singapore on June 12, Ree referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, at which time Kim referred to the decolonization of the "Kurdish Peninsula" in the "Kurdish Peninsula"
North Korea is seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang should first stop building its own nuclear weapon, the report said.
Washington has also opposed the call to put an end to tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. has pushed for deregulation at first and has raised the level of pressure from the sanctions so that it can achieve its goal forcefully, and at the same time, it has also objected to the 'declaration of the end of the war'."
"The attachment can bend us, the perception is a pipe dream of those who are ignoring us.
But the trouble is that our confidence in the continued ban is getting even less and less."
Ree did not discuss the plan for the second summit between Kim and Trump, he said the U.S. leader had condemned the atrocities of the United Nations last week.
Instead, the minister discussed three meetings between Kim and South Korea leader Moon J-in over the past five months and said, "If the party is South Korea for this problem and not in the U.S., there will be a South Korean peninsula."
Yet, Ree’s speech was very different from last year’s speech, when he said about the U.N. National Assembly that the so-called “missile man” on the suicide mission called “Mr. Evil President” after Trump. After North Korea’s rocket, U.S. Melange to Tart
In the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim's courage to be lifted for de-escalation but said there was still a lot of work to be done and the ban would remain in place until North Korea withdraws.
On Wednesday, Trump said he has no time limit set for it, "If it takes two years, three years or even five years - then it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are arguing that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps being taken by the U.N. Security Council (UNSC).
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council: "The Security Council's ban should remain in place until we realize that without any failure we are completely, finally and finally."
The Security Council has extended the ban on North Korea with full agreement in 2006 to deposit funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Rei at the U.N. General Assembly and then said he would return to Pyongyang for the second summit next month.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been a good one.
He returned from Pyongyang in July and said work had gone ahead, with North Korea condemning him for "gangster-like demands" within a few hours.
At this month's Moon meeting, North Korea has decided to destroy the missile site and if the United States takes "correct measures", it will also destroy the nuclear complex.
He said that Kim had promised him a "perfect solution", he was seeking security assurances that Trump would take a decision in Singapore and he went on to build a normal relationship with Washington.
Harvard's students are taking courses for a job that is comfortable enough.
Harvard University has launched a new course this year that is for all of its undergraduates who are struggling with the growing macho culture through the study of caffeine-fueled 'all-nighters'. Time spent fighting more-more-than-more
The number one teacher in the world who teaches students at a university often has no choice when it comes to what exactly common things to do to relax yourself.
Charles Casillar, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and an expert at Vimens Hospital, has created a course for which he believes it is the first of its kind in the U.S.
After talking about the impact of low sleep during education, he came up with the idea of starting this course.
He told The Telegraph, "I had a girl come to me at the end of the year and she said, 'Why do I say every time I have to go to class next year?'
He said that no one told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me.
This year, for the first time, students will learn about the importance of good gold practice in study-reading and athletic performance, in addition to this, their overall health will also be improved.
Paul Barrera, executive director of the Harvard Medical School, Professor of Psychiatry and Health Services of the University, said that students do not get enough sleep each week for which the University decided to start this course.
A series of interactive tasks has been included in the course, which runs for hours.
In one section, there will be an image of a dormitory room, where students will click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to tell what effect on caffeine and light will have and will be told about the lack of sleep, athletic performance, etc.
In the second section, participants will be told that insufficient sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with an interactive icon will be shown, then participants will be encouraged to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately,"" Professor Zeslar said."
But, we believe that they should have knowledge of this – just as smoking has information about the impact on health,” he said.
He said that the culture of experiencing pride in 'waking up reading all night' still exists, increasing pressure on modern technology and students means that they have less sleep which has become a growing problem.
Whether you sleep well enough or not, making sure it’s like a student’s ‘secret weapon’, allowing them to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – it protects them from the weight-bearing impact that even the lack of sleep keeps them awake.
Remand So, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, completed his last year's class in Harvard during last year's Aid Course of Professor Jessler.
He said that because of the course, he became aware and inspired for the campus-wide course.
In the future, he hopes that it will be considered necessary for all post-graduate students to complete this course before joining the competitive institution.
Pro Jessler suggested that students should consider setting alarms before bedtime, as well as, they should also decide when to wake up, and they should be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' emanating from the electronic screen and LED light.
Livingston's Rangers 1 - 0: Menga scored against Gerard
Due to Dolly Menga's strike, Rangers had to face trouble in another match, with Livingston's 1-0 win being blamed on Steven Gerard's wrong side.
After a 4-1 win at St. John's in February, Ibro Side was looking for their first win, but Gary Holt's team challenged Garrett as the manager for a second loss from Garard in 18 games to Landbrokers Jaime.
Before half-time, the Menga struck for seven minutes and then the Rangers' line-up shorts were not even given a chance to equalise the game.
However, Rangers have now dropped to sixth place in the rankings, Livingston has reached third place and is only behind the Iberians due to the goal difference.
In addition, after the object is clearly thrown on the other end of the object, since the lensman has been treated for the head injury of Calum Spence, then the game for rangers can be even more troublesome.
Due to eight changes made to the side of the guard, the previous air was given the opportunity to go to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was included in the same Livy 11 that took a point from the Hearts last week and the way they drilled in a good way bothered the opposing team on every turn.
The Rangers could have won the match, but Livingston played better than them.
When Menga sent Scott Pitman to Alan McGregor's goal by late-off for the first time, he should have only given him two minutes, but Midfielder missed this big opportunity he had found.
Kegan Jacobs, who was present in the Deep, when free-kicked, went to Captain Craig Halgate, but his defensive partner Allan Lithgo, who was present at the back post, could only be able to give a stab.
The Rangers got the control, but they were more confident in their game than they were in the final third.
Alfredo Morellos certainly experienced that he should have applied penance on the quarter-over mark as he and Steven Loless had clashed with each other, but referee Steven Thomson had rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers saved two shots on Target in the first-half, but Ibro's former goalkeeper Liam Keley had to face difficulties with Lasana Kolibli's header and TV OV Azariya's strike.
However, in the 34th minute, Livy's opener could have gone against the run of the game, but no one can deny that they are the only ones entitled to this graffiti.
Even after that, the best player in the Rangers Deep couldn't miss Jacob.
When Dean Gallagher passed Scott Robinson's ball, Scott Arfield didn't show any interest in it, Scott Robinson had calmed down to pick the menga for a simple finish.
When Garrett swapped the callibel for Ryan Kent and switched to show the effect immediately when he was slapping by the winger in Morelos, he had taken a break at the time, but Kelly blocked his line while running well.
But, Livingstone showed the visitor the same game as the kind of game they could really enjoy, he picked up the long ball with Lithgo and Halket after the long ball.
Holt's side in the final stage could have increased his growth, but before he was cornered by Lithgow, McGregor stopped the Jacobs well from the stud up.
Rangers called the existing Glen Middleton as an option, they claimed another late for Penalty as they were confused with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't let them succeed again.
Elmanack: The inventor of the Geiser counter
Now a page of our "Sand Morning" schedule: 136 years ago today, September 30, 1882 and the time after... the day when the physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
For the detection and measurement of radioactivity, Gizer invented a device that was later known as Gizer Counter.
Geiger counter is a major base of science, it has become the main base of pop culture, as well as, in 1950, it became a film "Bells of Coronado", in which for the first time scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans acted:
Man: "What does he do for the world?"
Rogers: "It's a geyser counter that's used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
After activating these earphones, you can certainly hear the impact of the atoms hidden in the mines due to radioactivity."
Ian: "Look, it's definitely popping right now!"
The death of "Hunter" Geiser occurred in 1945, at the time they were going to be 63 years old.
But, due to his invention, his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine could ‘see’ the bad cells of the immune system
Cancer’s new vaccine can ‘see’ the bad cells of the immune system and they can be eliminated
During treatment, the vaccine instructs the immune system to identify the bad cells during treatment.
With this method, the immune cells of a patient in the laboratory can be removed and replaced.
After that, they can ‘see’ the common protein for many cancers and then re-apply it by removing it.
Expectant outcomes are being seen in patients with different types of cancer in a trial for the vaccine.
A woman was given the vaccine, which saw her bad cells present in the immune system, then it was seen that her cancer of dementia, which has been present for more than 18 months, has ended.
This method can remove the immune cells of a patient in the laboratory and replace them, so that they can "see" the common protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then be reattached by removing the cells.
J Berzofsky, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that this vaccine is very promising."
Prof Berzofsky said that due to HER2, "there is a development of some types of cancer", which includes breast, dembergrant, lung and colorectal cancer.
"Given instructions" to remove the patient's immune cells and to identify cancerous cells is useful in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
After his SNL presence, Kanye West condemned Trump's old controversial speech on the MAGA hat.
It didn't work out
After Kanye West's best performance, in which she praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said that in 2020 he would also become their government, she condemned in the studio during Saturday's night life.
Following the performance of his third song of the night called Ghost Town, in which he was wearing the Make America Great Cap, he condemned the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So, I talk to the blonde people many times and they say, 'What's the reason for you to like Trump, they're racists?'"
Still, if I was worried about racism, I would leave the United States long ago.”
The SNL started the show with Matt Damon's sketch in which Hollywood star made fun of Bret Kavanaugh's case, it is already known that the Senate Judiciary Committee is already on them by Kristen Blacey Ford.
However, no such thing was shown, West's footage of condemnation was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It was not clear whether Rock was trying to fly West's laughter with the posting due to the post.
At the same time, West filed a complaint in front of the audience that he was threatened with going to the backstage with regard to his head wire.
"He threatened me with a back-up.
"You don't go there wearing that hat,"" he said."
They threatened me!
In addition, he also said that I am stuck in the wrong place," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West said, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" as well, they said, "My Superman will make a play for Cape, because it means you can't tell me what to do with me. Do you want to move the world forward?
Love it."
In his comments, he referred to the audience at least twice and felt shamed by the artist of the SNL, in a separate report, a person told the publication: "The whole studio was completely silent."
The singer was called to the West due to a delay in the arrival of Ariana Grande, the death of Ariana Grande's old boyfriend rapper Mac Miller a few days ago.
West surprised many viewers by giving performances on the song I Love it, she was dressed like a Periyar bottle.
West once again met with the head of the conservative group TPUSA Candace Turner, who tweeted: "Thanks for raising the voice for the people for one of the bravest people."
But, the show's host Karen Hunter tweeted that the West Bus is there "what she said and which is completely amazing."
"But, I didn't choose a person who would benefit (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his 'art') who was promoting the wrong idea for my community in my opinion or saying my community wrong.
He is free.
That's why we exist," he said.
Before the show, Rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, as well, saying that they were now "officially going by the name Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, but he's also done it by Diddy and Puffy, whose old name was P. Diddy and P. Diddy, respectively.
With him the rapper, Snoop Dogg's old name was Snoop Layan and the musician's late celebrity Prince had also changed his name to the symbol and after that the artist was already known as the Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Herrington asks questions about toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-bashing role as John Snow in HBO's Valeent Medieval Fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But, the 31-year-old actor has raised questions about the role of Macho Hero, saying that seeing such a role on the screen often inspires many young boys and they feel it is necessary to do such a difficult job to get respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kitt told reporters that he was feeling "something's wrong" and asked how to end the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Recently, Kitt married his co-star of Game of Thrones to 31-year-old Daily Leslie, who believes he feels "very strong" in talking about the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strongly that right now - are we doing something wrong about masculinity?" he said.
“Are we teaching men that when they grow up, they’ll have to face the problems that appear on the screen?”
Kit thinks that toxic masculinity can be partly responsible for television, he thanked its much more male lead factor.
What is it and what is it taught?
What is taught on TV and on the street, do young boys think they should do something certain to be a man?
In my opinion, this has really become one of the big questions of our time – how can we make a change in it?
For it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the minds of young men.'
In an interview, he also believed that when the series of Game of Thrones returns at the end of next summer, they will not participate in any prequels or sequels, as well, they also said that they have made a number of programs with 'warfields and horse riding'.
From November, Kit Sam Shepherd will be working on a new series of True West, which is the story of a film producer whose brother is Daku.
Recently, the actor said that the best thing that ever happened to him from Game of Thrones is to meet his wife every day.
"I got my life partner through this show, so I believe this show has given me the family of my future and my life has moved forward from here," he said.
Roz has played the role of Yogrit, who is the girlfriend of kitty actor John Snow in the Amy Award Winning Fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married with family consent in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new cases in China has increased by 14%, according to the report
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in the country.
Health officials said more than 820,000 people across the country are suffering from the disease.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Given the changes that have taken place in the past few days, most of the new cases are being referred to as sex.
Traditionally, HIV has been spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood infection.
At a conference in Yunnan Province, Chinese health officials said the number of people suffering from HIV had become nearly zero, according to the report.
However, the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
HIV infection from sex being done by China's LGBT community is a serious problem.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but it is said that the LGBT community has a lot of discrimination against people.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women because of the country's conservative values.
Due to many infections of the disease, there is insufficient protection in these relationships regarding sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been trying to solve this problem, for which every person has been promised that they will be given access to HIV drugs.
Maxine Waters has denied that her employees have leaked the data of the GOP senator, calling it a "dangerous lie" and a "how to plot"
The U.S. representative, Maxine Waters, described the allegations as unfortunate on Saturday, saying one of his employees had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on Lomaker's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the investigation of the claims was being conducted by the pandit and website of the "ultra-right wing".
Waters tweeted, "Lying, lying and a lot more stupid."
Allegedly, the information included the address and phone number of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and two Uta Senators Mike Lee and the house of Orin Hitch.
The information was seen online on Thursday which was posted by Capital Hill by an unknown person, when a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was ongoing.
Kavanaugh had been asked about the leaking of some of the information of the three senators.
Hill says that the identity of the IP address that identifies the source of the person posting, from a conservative site such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, was reported to have been linked to the source's office and was reported by an employee of the Waters.
Waters said, "This allegation is completely baseless, false and absolutely false."
"Any of my employees - whose identity, personal information and security are being put at risk because of these false and false allegations - were in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This allegation is baseless, totally false and absolutely false."""
Waters soon posted online to clean up the criticism, which included the former press secretary of the White House as well.
Fletcher wrote, "The reason for this rejection is anger."
"It is well known that his character is not the same as that of a member of Congress.
When an accusation is made against someone, they should not get angry and do so.
They should not be rebels.
They should not question the person who has accused them.
They should be calm and patient.”
It seemed that compared to Fletcher Waters's response, Judge Kavanaugh was condemning the democrats of Kavanaugh, who on Thursday accused Kavanaugh of being very angry during the hearing.
Umar Nawaro, a Republican candidate for the midterm election, also tweeted his thoughts on Twitter, saying he would lose the water.
He tweeted, "If it's true, it's a big deal."
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement units to these allegations of fraud.
"We will determine whether or not the perpetrators will be told about, and whether they will be legally held accountable for all the work they have done which is very bad and dangerous for any and all of my employees," he said.
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Rowan Atkinson's spying wasn't considered too daring
The importance of brexit in any new film from the British point of view is still traditionally seen and it appears to be applied to this revival of Johnny English's action-comedy Spuff franchise from the beginning with Johnny English in 2003 and with Johnny English in the beginning.
Will we be self-indulgent on the subject of what kind of nonsense do we consider to be talking about the nation's new export opportunity?
Johnny English, who has a pop-oriented and rubber-faced attitude at any rate, has his license so that things with bare feet can be recreated - which is much more famous than anything else in his name alone, he is very popular with locals.
They are certainly the Dufte Secret Agents who managed to show Mr. Bean's Dash Cluso a bit-much in spite of his strange thug in Smutty Glamour and have a dollop for that chap who was at the 2012 Olympic Open in London.
He is originally a traveler and is the international man of mystery Atkinson whose role in Barclaycard TV commercials aside from the Chaos of Weak was forgotten.
In this new JE outing, you only get to see one or two good scenes.
I liked Johnny English quite a lot in which it was shown to go to the helicopter wearing a medieval suit and wrap the rotor blade on his helmet.
Physical comedy on the screen is a kind of gift for Atkinson, but laughter came very low and seemed semi-unpleasant, especially "better" movies like 007 and Mission Impossible. The brand itself makes a component of the comedy itself.
Laughter comes in the form of comedy not for adults but for children, and Johnny English's bizarre misunderstandings are not at all tolerable in my opinion and I've liked Bean more in Atkinson's silent-film.
The important thing is always here that there is a serious crisis in the UK.
The UK's most secret spy network has been hacked by a cyber-hacker, the network identified all of Britain's acting agents so that the agent's work can be affected - it's a sad event for Kevin Olden.
This is the last support for the brilliant and quite disturbing Prime Minister, they are already facing many political and unpopular problems: this quasi-terrestrial-me-factor can perform well. Emma Thompson is not able to work on this script
His smart advisors told him that every worker who has made an agreement with the spy would have to bring him to a person who has retired.
In this way it meant that Johnny English had to fight for himself, which is now a school master at a Push Institute, but a subordinate operative has to work it apart from the record on how it should be. It has some good humor stories in it, as well as, by a spy
The Englishman has been sent back to the Emergency Whitehall for briefing and Ben Miller's reprise role has been mixed with his rather old-fashioned sidekick-buffet.
Now that Buff's married, he is trying to become a sub-commander, his role is played by Jolly-Hockey-Sticks in which Vicky hasn't gotten the paperwork.
So, in her Majesty's Secret Service, Batman and Robin get some very big mistakes when they face Olga Kruelenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister comes to terms with that Kerismetic technical billionaire who claims he has a solution to the UK's computer crises: the late Jason Volta played the role of Jack Lacey.
English and Bog begin their odyssey of the professional high-jinks: the knights fire at a French restaurant while working as the knights; they plunder through the expensive ship of the volta; and the knights of the English are completely arraigned by the knights.
For that final sequence, the film has certainly been pulled everywhere, but still it's neat and fun, there are pretty funny things for kids in the whole movie.
of a medium-sized scale.
In addition, as I saw in other Johnny English films, in this film I did not understand whether or not Rowan Atkinson should be given a role in the British film industry that is in fact according to his talent?
Labour has denied that he is planning to work just four days a week for the people of the UK, but the money will come in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labor Party is considering becoming a Republican scheme, in which UK residents will have to work only four days a week - but the money will come in five days.
The party is reportedly keen to give the workers part of the savings through the company's Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution so that they can get an additional day's leave.
This will give the employee a three-day leave per week - but still they will get the same pay.
Sources say such an idea will remain 'big' with the party's economic agenda and it is a plan to benefit the workers.
The Trades Union Congress is being promoted to a four-day shift per week so that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour official from The Sunday Times said: "Politics review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
"This will not happen overnight, but rather is expected to start a four-day week of work, which is consistent with the overall industrial strategy of the party as well as the party's view of economic rebalancing in favour of the workers."
While the Green Party, which promises a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign, will not be the first party to support such an idea.
However, this desire is currently not being fully supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesperson said, "Four-day work week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell had used last week's labor conference to present his view on the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he had been determined to regain power from the "unsuccessful directors" and "munafakhors" in utility firms.
Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies cannot get their full stake back as the Labour government can ‘decrease’ based on alleged misdeeds.
He also confirmed the plan to include employees on the company's boards and to create an inclusive ownership fund to deliver 10 per cent equity to private sector firms for employees, which can receive an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lyndsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Cavanana can change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Bret Cavna delayed his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week in the final vote, and the question arises as to whether the Bureau's findings led to a Republican senator's withdrawal of his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Paley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lyndsey Graham if there is a possibility that the FBI would find something that would inspire them to change their minds.
Kennedy looked more brightly than his ally in South Carolina.
"I think so," Kennedy said.
"I said that while going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After that, when this accusation came up, I called them, asking, ‘Did you do that?’
They were sure, firm, clear."
However, Graham's vote seemed to be a stone's throw.
"I had made up my mind about Brett Cavanaugh and it needed explosive charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has repeatedly denied," Graham said, referring to Christian Blasey Ford.
"And whatever he named, he could not verify it."
This is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citation Festival and has it been reduced to poverty?
This Saturday will host the New York, Global City Festival, which is an annual music program featuring many highly influential stars, and just as influential is its mission; to end the world's poverty.
Now in its seventh year, tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes in the Great Loon of Central Park at the Global City Festival, but to work to eradicate excessive poverty by 2030
Starting in 2012, the Global City Festival, an international advocacy group, is an extension of the Global Power Project, which hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get free tickets for the program (except when you are not ready to pay for VIP tickets), to help people who go to the concert create awareness of their goal of eliminating poverty. To become a volunteer to help them "become a volunteer, be a world leader"
But how successful has the Global Citation been in the remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people by means of a free music program the right way to appeal to people for action, or is there just another case of so-called "cliquetivism" - people seem to be signing a petition online or signing a petition?
Since 2011, Global Citation has said that by advancing efforts for various goals, it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to declare equal commitments and policies of more than $37 billion set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 pledges and announcements made by its actions, of which at least $10 billion is already being distributed or raised in cash.
The group is estimated to have had a direct impact on about 649 million people around the world so far.
Some of the key commitments include, The Power of Nutrition, a U.K.-based investor and activist's participation in the campaign, which has helped Rwanda earn $35 to end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
During a live concert in London in April 2018, the Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracy Ulman, told the crowd, "With the help of the British Government, the donor, the national government, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition"
The group also said that after calling on the UK for improvement in nutrition for mothers and children, after more than 5,000 actions, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition. With the help of 5 million women with nutrition interventions
In response to a frequently asked question on your website, “Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult path - sometimes the burden we will fall and fail.
But, just like the great civil rights and anti-discrimination movements before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jenel Monae are among the performers at this year's show in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the navy for "restriction" to create barriers to Russian energy exports - Internal Secretary
According to the Washington Examiner, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed that Washington could take the U.S. Navy's assistance to stop Russian energy in U.S. markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleged that Russia's work in Syria - particularly, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
He allegedly said that "I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to harness energy, as they have done in the southern regions of Europe, in eastern Europe.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, unblock them, so that it can ensure that their energy does not go into the market," he said.
Zinke, a non-profit group, was addressing people present at the program organized by the Consumers Energy Alliance, who call themselves the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran by saying that they are effectively on par with each other.
Referring to Russia as a "one-wheeled tattoo" with a biofuel-dependent economy, he said, "The economic option in the case of Iran and Russia is to take advantage of fuel and replace it."
The Trump administration, taking the place of Russia, is on a mission to promote the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that extent, officials of the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "improper" North Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump, who is "the creator of Moscow" Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that $11 billion of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which is ready to double the existing pipeline capacity by 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin's argument is that Washington's widespread opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
After a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said, "I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a means of pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers".
Germany opposed the U.S. stance, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's industry-leading organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
The head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), Dieter Kemph, said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "There is a big state in our energy supply at the moment.
The Massachusetts senator said, Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the case of joining the presidential race in 2020 and will be "seriously considering"
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections, adding that she would "consider" the run for president.
During the town hall in Holouk, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider taking part in the race.
According to The Hill, she said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and join our broken government and also include being a woman at the top."
"After November 6, I will seriously consider fighting for election for the post of President."
While assessing President Donald Trump during the Town Hall, Warren said, "They're taking this county in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned from within what Donald Trump is finally doing for our democracy," he said.
Warren, Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh are critical of the decision.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need to check the FBI before the vote."
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's components don't think he should fight the 2020 election.
According to the Saffok University Political Research Center/Boston Global Poll, eighty-one percent of Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not fight the election.
Twenty-three percent of the voters voted in this way.
The survey showed more support in the case of contesting by former Governor Deval Patrick, where 38 per cent supported the possibility of participating in the election race and 48 per cent were against it.
Former Vice President Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders are among the other high-profile Democratic nominees who are likely to fight for the 2020 election.
Biden said that he would officially disperse by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin refers to Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
The 26-year-old track Pauline spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
In a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he said to the audience, "My son has been going through the process of coming back to what he's feeling, because of what I'm feeling with other families who are suffering from PTSD, I'm sorry for the other families who feel the effects of PTSD."

According to Dan Bennet, a spokesperson for the Vasila Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Alaska's Vasila and charged with domestic violence against a woman and holding a weapon by drowning in alcohol.
18 States, D.C. Support the Challenge of New Protection Policy
The Eighteen States and the District of Columbia are backing a new U.S. policy of legal challenge that denies sheltering victims of gang-escaping or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives of 18 states and districts filed a justice-friendly summary letter in Washington on Friday to support a refugee who was challenging the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
He said his partner "and the sons of his violent gang members" abused him, but U.S. officials rejected his request to give shelter on July 20.
He was taken into custody in Texas.
Government lawyers who support the gress described al-Salwadar, Honduran and Guatemala as nations facing widespread problems of gang and domestic violence, which generate large numbers of applications for U.S. refugees.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 ruling issued by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to be allowed to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Carl Resin, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores the state, federal and international law of decades."
"The federal law expects that all asylum claims should be adjudicated on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an objection violates that principle," Justice-Friend said.
Attorney further argued in the letter that the policy of denying immigrants entry, saying this, harms the U.S. economy that is more likely to become their entrepreneurs and to "supply the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to provide shelter to victims of domestic abuse and collective violence in June.
In its June 11 announcement, Sessions said, "Those who leave their homeland due to harassment or fear due to membership of their caste, religion, nationality or a particular social group are available to them."
The shelter was never meant to reduce all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people around the world face every day.
The number of people killed in the search for survivors has doubled, as the number of people who died in the search for survivors has increased.
For the rescuers, the situation was extremely serious.
"It seems extremely stressful," said 35-year-old mother Reisa Kusuma, comforting the child suffering from fever in the evacuation center of Tehsa-Nahas Palu city.
"Every minute an ambulance brings in the bodies.
Clean water is rare."
When the residents returned to their rightful homes, they were seen taking up waterlogged goods, trying to save him from whatever he found.
Hundreds of people were injured in a 7.5-magnitude earthquake and the hospital sank.
Some injured people, including Duvi Haris, who were facing broken backs and shoulders, rested outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to constant strong earthquake shocks.
Feeling the shocks of a violent earthquake in the room of his fifth mansion, shared with his wife and daughter, he burst into tears in his eyes.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think, I was stuck in the partition of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, as well as told that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Destroying' Through 'Advertising'
A U.S. newspaper in a U.S. daily by the government Chinese newspaper, referring to the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade, a week after running a four-page ad, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. press to advertise.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused China of trying to interfere in the Congress elections on November 6 - Ayodhya's top-selling newspaper - Des Moines, China's most-watched newspaper, has filed a lawsuit against the Chinese government
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election, U.S. officials told Reuters there was a new step in Washington's push-up campaign against China.
While it is common to advertise for foreign governments to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has seen them in the process of imposing border-free tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's first trade war was designed to strike at exporters in states such as the anti-China border-free Iowa, which had backed Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstead, longtime US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, China, a major exporter of agricultural goods, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstead, writing in his opinion on Sunday in the Des Moines Register, wrote that China, "is now doubling that villain by running advertising in our independent press."
"In its propaganda-preaching, advertising paid in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's nourishing tradition of freedom of speech and independent journalism," Branstead wrote.
"Given that the media is locked in the strong grip of the Chinese Communist Party, on the contrary, here at the newsstand on the side of the road in Beijing, you will get limited unsatisfactory voices and no right reflection of those inconsequential opinions," he said.
He said that "one of China's most important newspapers abstained from making a proposal to publish his article", although he did not name the newspaper.
Women voters are being segregated before the Republican midterm elections with the defeat of Kavanaugh, analysts warned
Since the Supreme Court candidates facing multiple allegations of top republican sexual harassment are supporting and defending Bret Cavana, the analyst has warned that they will, in the course of the upcoming mid-term elections, look especially at women
Its intentional feelings are quite overwhelming, and most Republicans are already showing on the record that they want to move forward with the vote.
You can't go back on those things," Grant Reehar, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reehar said he doubts that Senator Jeff Fleck (R-Arizona) would be enough to calm down the pressure angry voters in the last minute for an FBI investigation.
According to a Washington D.C. newspaper, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday said, "Women who can't forget what happened yesterday. Neither can they forget tomorrow nor can they forget it in November."
On Friday morning, when the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee wanted to move forward with the nomination of Cavana despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, then the protesters who have been performing in the Senate's Dalan have been "punished" by the protesters.
A non-political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site, "Democratic enthusiasm and inspiration are going to be removed from the chart."
"People are saying it's already huge; it's true.
But it could be more, especially among the female voters of the suburbs and young voters aged 18-to-29 who don't vote often when the president doesn't like them."
While detailing the allegations of sexual harassment by the ford against the person nominated by the Supreme Court, the analysts had already said that if the Republicans proceed with the confirmation, there is a possibility of opposition to it.
According to NBC News, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said, "This has become a confusing mess for the GOP."
"It's not just about putting the committee vote or the final vote or Cavanna on the bench, it's also about the case of how the Republican has handled it and how they have dealt with them," said the agency that helped the Democrat in the election, Diyaz Neza U.S.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided in this case as to who to believe in the face of Ford and Cavan's testimony, most of which came from Cavan's side.
A new survey by YouGov found that 41 percent of respondents believed in certain or likely Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed in certain or likely Cavanana.
In addition, 38 per cent said they felt that Cavan<0xC3><0xA1> had probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Fleck, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other Fariad, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Cavanna had beaten him in a drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez's allegation is that the Supreme Court's nominee displayed his gendarmes when he joined a party while studying in Yale in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet in comparison to Google and Facebook.
Tim Burners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup that wants to hit Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds Burners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people will be allowed to access to what information.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Burners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to achieve "global dominance."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It may include contact information, to-do information, calendar, music library, and other personal and business tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal online data store is that it completely depends on the user who can access what kind of information they can access.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills by the company so that Solid can make them available to everyone.
The company currently consists of a security platform purchased by Burners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of venture coders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized app using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Lee said he and his team "are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to start the whole change, where all of their business models will end up completely overnight.
"We are not asking for permission from them."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Burners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and environmental mechanisms to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, Burners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burners-Lee net has been an influential voice in the coastal debate.
Even when Inrupt launches, Burners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly hopeful for this next era of the web," Burners-Lee said.
Bernard Vaughn: Victoria Cross clarinet celebrates WW1
During World War I, the only statue of the Church of England to win the Victoria Cross as a warrior was commemorated in his hometown of 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vaughn won the award in the attack on 29 September 1918 in Belengliez and the Lehocourt.
However, they were killed four days later by a sniper and they never knew they had won the highest British military honour.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two of his boats at the parade held in Rashden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of their fathers, Michael Vaughn, said it was "miraculously symbolic" that exactly 100 years after winning his grandfather's award, this portrait is being unveiled.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan led his battalion in the Canal de Saint-Quentin "between a very dense cave, under heavy artillery and machine guns in the field of war."
Later they advanced towards the firing line and, with "great bravery", led the army-line before taking the field-gun into their own hands and crushed three pieces.
On October 4, 1918, just one month before the end of the war, Lt. Col. Vaughn was killed by a German sniper.
Michael Vaughn, 72, said his grandfather's carnage "was something that I know can never match, but on which we have a laugh."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vaughn, also donated after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughn said they "feel very honored to play a role in the parade" and he said "the bravery of a real hero is being demonstrated by the support being given by many people."
MMA fans were awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got the Peppa Pig
Imagine, you've been awake to watch Bellator 206 full of shit all night, but you've been deprived of watching the main show.
San Jose's bill had 13 contestants, including six on the main card and was shown live all night on U.K. Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gearard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the audience in the U.K. remained stunned by the change to Peppa Pig of the cover.
There was a lot of disappointment after waking up in the morning, especially for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described switching to children's cartoons as "a kind of disease fun."
Asked about the broadcast, senior vice president of Bellator, Dave Schwartz, said, "According to government regulations, this material was not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to switch on children's programming."
"""Poppa the Pig," "Yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Cooker, said he is going to work on his schedule to engage the U.K. audience in the future.
"I think when I think about repelling, I think we'll probably find a solution to that," Kocher said.
"But there will be six o'clock on Sunday morning and we won't be able to work on it until Sunday, our time, their time Monday.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, there were a lot of text voices going on when this change happened and they weren't all compatible.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was some technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that won’t happen next time.
We're going to keep it limited to five instead of six - as we usually do - and when we tried to deliver something more to the fans, it just got a little more.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley feels 'innocent' in the case of camaraderie
Olympic goth archer Tom Daley says he was impressed by the sentiment towards everyone because of his generosity - but he got the inspiration to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he got to high school that "everyone's not like me."
Speaking on the Radio 4 Desert Island disc first presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he talks about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said he was less concerned about winning the Olympics when he became a father.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a socio-savvy person on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "low" in himself compared to everyone else because "choosing boys and girls wasn't socially acceptable."
"Even today, those feelings of feeling less than others, and feeling different, are real things that have given me the strength and strength to be able to succeed," she said.
He wanted to prove that he was also a "person," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when he finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and has used his presence in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to reduce homosexuality.
He said he spoke openly because he felt lucky when he was able to live openly without any trouble and he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - since when he fell in love - "I was surprised."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so many experiences at such a young age" - she went to her first Olympics at the age of 14 and died of cancer three years later of her father - she said that at such a young age, we have to go through the same kind of experiences as we have.
In June, the couple became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Dally, and Daley said his "whole attitude" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would all be related to 'I need to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know, there are a lot more things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son's name is the same as his father Robert, who died in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer at the age of 40.
"His father didn't just admit that he was going to die and what he wanted to know the last time was whether he got London 2012 tickets - because they wanted to sit in the front row.
He said, "I couldn't tell them you wouldn't stay in the next row, Dad."
He said, "When they could not breathe, I held their hand and held them until their breath stopped and they were dead, so I went and thought they were not unlucky."
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that that's what I've been dreaming of all my life - kicking in front of the indigenous people at the Olympics, there was no better feeling than that," she said.
It also inspired his first favorite song - Proud Bye Heather Small - which was echoing with him during the preparation of the Olympics and which, hearing, still stand up to his ringtones.
The Desert Island disc will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST on Sunday.
Out-of-Form Michaelson from the Raider Cup on Saturday
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th Rider's Cup match, but he will have to change his form to save it from becoming the unfortunate milestone.
While playing for the 12th time in a two-year program for the record, Michaelson put out of the game for Saturday's Forbes and Forsam.
Instead of becoming a center of attraction, as he is often staying for the United States, the top five-time winner spent working amongst the winners of his day and hoping to improve on the weaknesses in the way he played.
The 48-year-old, who has never driven directly to the end of his career, has never been an ideal fit for the Tit Le Golf National Course, where long-term non-actives get regularly punished for wrong shots.
And where anyway the course is not so easy, while in Sunday's ninth match, Mikkelson's match will be against British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has this week won all four of his matches with Rocky Tommy Flywood.
If the U.S. players, who start at four points in 12 singles games, start strong, the match of Mikkelson can prove to be quite important.
Furick put his trust in his man, not that they could say anything else.
"He fully understood his role, patted my back and wrapped me in his arms and said they would be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer and has made a lot of contributions to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I had more imagination, but it was the way it worked and the way we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to go out there just like everyone else."
Mickelson will cross Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Riders Cup matches on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a rider's cup career that has never reached the heights of his personal record.
Michaelson has scored 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though Furick said his presence brings some intricacies to the team.
"He's funny, he's artistic, he's responsive, people like to fly funny, and his presence in the team room is special," he explained.
"I think the young players have also had a lot of fun going to them this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
European captain Thomas B<0xC3><0xB6>rn knows that big growth may soon be gone.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from his experience that a fairly large increase in last-day singles in the Rider Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable move.
Dan made his first appearance in the 1997 match at Valderama, where a side in the captaincy of Sev Ballestiros had scored five points higher on the Americans, but with a win of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2, taking the lowest margin. Just on the finishing line
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big leader in Valderama; our big leader in Brooklyn, where we were lost, and in Valderama, we just won." The 2018 class went from Friday 5-3 and yesterday saw Le Golf National, batting 10-6
So history will show me and all the people of that team that it's not over.
You will pay the full price tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It won't end until you get the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy and that's where we have to keep the focus.
I’ve always said, I’m focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re well aware of the fact that the greatest players in the world are standing on the other side.”
Bjorn went on to say how his players performed at the tough golf course: "In this I will never be able to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a tough time.
Tomorrow's personal performance will come forward, and that's a different thing.
When everything is going well, it’s nice to go there with the partner, but when you go out there personally, the entire test of your ability as a golfer is done.
This is the message that you need to reach out to the players to show off your best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and have to go and give him his best performance as well."
In contrast to Bjorn, opposite standing Jim Furick would have been aiming for a personally better performance for his players than he had done as a partner, the exceptions being Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who had scored three out of four points.
Before facing defeat due to the "miracles in Medina" tax by Europe, because of being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, Furick himself was on both sides of those big final days' replays."
"I remember every riff of it," he said in response to being asked how Captain Ben Craneshaw had handled his players on the last day in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'll want to start as fast as you've seen in Brooklyn, as you've seen in Medina.
When this speed is one-sided, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches between them.
We set up our line-up on our own and included people like this, as we felt, you know, we're trying to do something else tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the responsible attack with Rory McClere in the top match, where Paul K.C., Justin Roz, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Potter are the top half of the other European order.
"I had formed their group in this order because I think it covers all of them," Bjorn said of his single selections.
Germany's new battleship has been rescheduled
New German Navy warships were to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the time-affected Cold War warships, but due to faulty systems and rapidly rising costs, it will not be so until at least next year, the local media said.
According to a military spokesman, the commissioning of the "Reinland-Puffs", which is the main ship of the warships of the brand new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-Sreini, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the troublesome issues after delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships had been ordered back in 2007 by the Navy to be brought in as replacements for the Kal-affected Bremen-Sreni warships.
It is understood that they will provide a range of powerful tops, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth techniques such as low-radar, stealth and sonic division facilities.
Other important features include a long maintenance period - it is possible to deploy the latest warships for up to two years from indigenous ports.
However, the constant delay means that the state-of-the-art warship - which will allow Germany to have the opportunity to power projects abroad - will be delayed until the period of entry into service, Dai Zin said.
The Durdant F125 battleship was the Surkya battery back last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned the Blohm and Was Shipyard to Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the ship's manufacturer after delivery.
Very few people knew about the reasons for the return, but the German media reported several important "software and hardware errors", which denied the warship when deployed on a war mission.
The shortages of software were particularly important as the ships of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-Srein would be operated by a fleet of some 120 sailors - which is only half the population of the old Bremen-class warships.
In addition, it also emerges that the ship is dramatically heavier which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The "Reynland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons is considered to be twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the value tag of the entire project - which also includes the training of the driver team - is becoming an issue.
It is said that it has reached from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn).
In the light of recent warnings, the problem of new warships, which have become especially important in the light of recent warnings, has been eroding the naval power of Germany.
Earlier this year, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, Hans-Peter Bartels, admitted that the Navy is actually "decommissioning anti-tank ships."
The issue has become serious over time, the official said, as the old ships were removed from service, but no replacement ships were made available.
He said none of the warships in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-Shreni were able to join the navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of the lighthouses
The purpose of the new research being carried out in an estate of the Scottish Highlands is to reveal how cockroaches use natural scenery in their prey for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help guide future conservation activities in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland, will be followed by the common and soprano peppers, as well as long brown ears, and the Dobenton chamomiles sitting in the Inverway Garden of Westen Ross.
Special records will be set at key locations around the property to track the activities of the lighthouses throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
From the expert sound analysis of all recording, the frequency of the bat call and the fact that it shows which species are doing what.
Then a map and report of the nature-house will be prepared for painting on a detailed landscape-map of their behavior.
Robert Dewar, NTS's nature conservation advisor, hopes the results will reveal which area of natural habitat is the most important for snails and how they are used by each species.
This information will help in determining the benefits of natural-home management functions such as how to build grassland and how to maintain the woodlands well for grasslands and other related species.
In the last century, there has been a significant decline in the population of cockroaches in Scotland and throughout the UK.
They are at risk from construction and development work, which affects the birds' nests and harms the natural-dwelling habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting systems can also pose a risk, as some chemical treatments of flypaper and building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats, can also be dangerous.
The lights aren't really dark.
However, due to their hunting habits when it comes to catching the prey, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to point out faults and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes Chamgadar very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, observe bird flocks, and sometimes save them.
The organisation has set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in Scotland's Damfries and Galloway's Three Estates, home to eight of Scotland's ten squid species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says the estate is the best place for him.
"We have a good area for candlelight here in threes," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good natural homes.
But there's a lot about chamgaddar that's still unknown, so what we're working on here and other assets will help us understand what they need to achieve."
They emphasize the importance of screening for fleas before they are kept inside the property as it is possible that 400 females and infants can be destroyed from the collapse of the maternity-pregnant port, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
The spiders are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their limbs.
The Scottish officer of the Bat Conservancy Trust, Elizabeth Fairel, has encouraged the public to come forward to help.
"We still have a lot to know about our snails and about our many species we still don't know how their populations are growing," he said.
Ronaldo has denied the rape allegations, while the lawyers filed a lawsuit against the German newspaper.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "the fake news", saying people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer is on trial at the German news magazine Der Spigel, who has published the allegations.
In 2009, an American woman named Catherine Meyorga was allegedly raped in a room at the Las Vegas hotel on Portugal and Juventus Ford.
Dee Spigel said in a report on Friday that she allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
Addressing his 142 million followers after reporting the allegations in an Instagram live video, 33-year-old Ronaldo described the reports as "stupid news."
"No, no, no, no.
"What he said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be popular with my name, but this is part of their work.
"I'm a happy person and everything is fine," the player said, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyer, Der Spegel, is preparing to prosecute those allegations, according to Reuters, which he has called "suspected dishonest reporting in the field of privacy."
Advocate Christian Shertz said the player "will seek compensation for moral damage amounting to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is said that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of Pams Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to the papers filed in the Clark County District Court of Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Meyorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped him.
Meyorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell to the force of his knees and told them that "99 percent" is a "good person" whose "one percent" has been disappointed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had had sex, but there was mutual consent for it.
Meyorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had also drawn pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an agreement outside the court because she felt "terrified by the review" and she was "publicly insulted".
The 34-year-old says he is now trying to end the agreement as his harassment has continued since the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and in this summer he negotiated a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal with Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: The U.K. will be 'responsible forever' to lose producer
Commerce Secretary Greg Clarke said the U.K. would be "sad forever" if he loses his degree as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He said that Toyota U.K. had told the BBC that if the UK left the European Union, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnston near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clarke said.
The Japanese carmaker said that a no-deal Brexit could have an impact on jobs as a result of the border delay.
The Burnstone Plant - which makes Toyota's Oris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
Marvin Cook, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnston, said, "I believe that if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will stop production in our factory."
Other U.K. car makers have expressed concern about how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, without agreeing to leave the EU.
BMW, for example, says it will shut down its mini plant for a month after Brexit in Oxford.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to the risk of supply chain in the situation of no-dial Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, in which the U.K. and the European Union, both from suppliers, come in batches of mid-to-order cars every 37 minutes.
If the U.K. leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29th, a deal could be created on the border, according to the industry, which could result in delays and shortages.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to have more than one day's inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so production would be shut down.
Mr Clarke said Theresa's chequer-me scheme for future relations with the European Union "has obviously been calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need a deal. We want a best deal that, in my opinion, can enjoy not only success at the moment, but which is also necessary to achieve this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Tude program.
"Not only Toyota but also other manufacturers have found evidence that we should be able to fully maintain it which has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production would be shut down, but in the long run, warned that the plant's competitiveness would decrease at an additional cost and eventually the jobs would go away.
Peter Sauvalrys, who has worked in Burnston for 24 years and is a United Union coordinator at the plant, said his members are extremely concerned: "Once in my experience when these jobs go away, they never come back after bad.
"We have put forward an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union," a government spokesman said.
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again
The White House said on Sunday that a high-profile meeting with Donald Trump's deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed to "a week and a week later" as Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavana's fight continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the relationship between the Russian election intervention, Trump's aide and Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether or not Trump will remove the deputy attorney general, and as a result of which Muller's freedom is at risk, this news has warmed the market of Washington's rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wiretapping the conversation with Trump and removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday they went to the White House amid these reports, that they are going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "not like to remove Rosenstein" but then was delayed in the meeting to avoid a confrontation from that hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which included a woman accused of being a victim and sexually assaulted by a woman, Dr. Christine Blasey Dord.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI probe into the allegations against Cavanna, delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sara Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "The date has not been set for this, it may be this week, I can see that the view of all the other cases pending with the Supreme Court can be pushed forward another week.
But we will see and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some journalists have claimed that: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefing was not due to interest in the "presence" of TV reporters, though he said: "I do not disagree with the fact that they are great."
He again suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
He said, "The President has more question-answer sessions than any other President," noting the evidence, he said, "We have seen those numbers."
The briefing will still be, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it's better than talking to me.
We do a lot of trying and you have seen a lot of us doing this in the last few weeks and when you can talk to the President of the United States he is going to take the place of the press conversation."
While leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or with dignitaries, Trump regularly answers questions at the press conference.
Single-day press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York, the President demonstrated why, perhaps, by demonstrating a unique presence in front of the journalists who were present.
Health Secretary, NHS Scotland, writes about the fears of Brexit to EU workers in the UK and the UK.
The Health Secretary has written to the employees of the European Union working in the NHS of Scotland with a desire to express gratitude to the country and to remain after Brexit.
The Gen Freeman MSP has sent a letter to the European Union in less than six months regarding the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union.
The Scottish Government is committed to meeting the cost of settlement status applications for citizens of the European Union who are already working in their emergency public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "In the summers, the interplay between the U.K. and the European Union continued, moving towards the expected decisions in this harsh season.
But the U.K. government is also moving ahead with its preparations for a potential no-deal scenario.
I know this will be a time of great uncertainty for all of you.
That’s why I wanted to reiterate now that I give importance to their contribution without caring about the nationality of each staff member.
The European Union, and beyond, brings with it co-workers, valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, and benefit the patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Emergency surgery of Christian Abercrombie after an injury to the head
"Tennis State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie, who faced a 31-27 loss from Wanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, underwent emergency surgery after a head injury, the Tennessee Tigers said."""
Tennessee head coach Rod Reid told reporters that the injury took place just some time before Hoftime.
"He came to the shore and just fell there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave the oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before putting him on the stretch and taking him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Aberdrombie Wanderbilt has come out of surgery at the Medical Center.
Harris said that "no details on the type/limit of injury are available so far" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is a Redshirt sophomore, is in her first season with the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game, he made a total of five tackles on Saturday, making his season a total of 18 tackles.
High Stamp Duty Will Be Taken From Foreign Buyers When Buying Property in the U.K.
When foreign buyers buy property in the U.K., they will be charged a high-stakes duty, which will be used to help the homeless under new tory schemes.
This step will underpin the success of the campaign of the Corbin to attract young voters.
Increased Stamp Duty will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the U.K.
The Treasury hopes it will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million in a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers are being prepared to recover a high stamp duty rate on the purchase of property in the U.K. - which additional money will be used to help homeless people, will be announced today in Theresa.
The move is being seen as an attempt to undermine the success of Jeremy Corbin's campaign, which attracts young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high earners.
The Stamp Duty Increase will be imposed on non-taxpayers and firms in the U.K., with additional funds that will be boosted by the government's campaign to deal with gold miners in toxic conditions.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the current Stamp Duty, which includes purchases to be made on two houses and leases started two years ago, can be a maximum of three per cent.
The Treasury is expected to grow to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million in a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly constructed London properties are purchased by residents of non-U.K., which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to keep foot on the housing ladder.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" as there are more such foreign buyers, who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came just weeks after a call for a cut in the Stamp Duty was made by Boris Johnson to help more young people build their first home.
He accused land raiding on large construction sites but not using them to bring up the prices of property, and urged the mission to leave a quota on affordable homes to fix Britain's "residential waste."
Mr. Corbin has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the end of rent controls and "no-fault" disputes.
They want to give more power to the Councils to build new houses.
"Last year I said that I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation," he said.
And that means that we are going to fix the housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to stay, work and build a life.
However, it is not true that it is as easy for non-residents in the UK as it is for foreign-based companies to buy homes for working British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a house has come to be very far away, and the smell of gold in toxic conditions is very real.”
Jack Ross: 'My last ambition is to manage Scotland's economy'
Jack Ross, the boss of Sanderland, says his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scott is repeating the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which is currently in third place in the league forest, and which is three points away from the top.
He went to the stadium of light in the summer of this year after directing St. Mirren for the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's just it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father from a young age, and it's always been something that pulls me back.
This opportunity will come only when I succeed in managing the club."
As manager of Sanderland, Ross' predecessors include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Cain, Gauss Pochett and Paulo de Canio.
The former Eloa Athletic boss says he didn't feel intimidated to follow up on such established names in such a large club, which had previously rejected the initiative of Burnsley and Epswich Town.
"For me at the moment, the assumption of success can be made that I can return this club to the Premier League?"
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it certainly comes in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I'll probably see myself succeeding here if I can get to the club there."
After spending 15 months as the assistant boss of Dumberton and 15 months in the coaching staff of Hearts, Ross's management career has only lasted three years.
Then they helped Eloa recover from the third tier defeat, and St. Mirren was replaced by the championship title winner's defeat back in the next season by a rematch.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he does during his career at the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
In the case of taking over Aloa's office, he said, "It was probably a real joke."
"I really believed that management was more fit for me than playing the game.
It seems strange because I worked properly, earned the right amount of money from it, and enjoyed some decent heights.
But it can be difficult to play.
You have to get a lot of things on a weekly basis.
I still go through them in terms of job stress and pressure but everything seems fine in terms of management.
I’ve always wanted to manage and now that I’m doing it, it makes me feel the most comfortable in my entire adult life.”

The correct time for a paint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., found in the survey
The summer's coverage has boosted Britain's conflicting pubs, but it has put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
The pub and bar group saw a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July - but the drop-off in restaurants was down 4.8 per cent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, Business Consultancy CGA, who compiles the figures, also said: "The July in comparison to the expected participation in the World Cup of England and Lagatar Dhup means that in the month of June last year, the same pattern was followed by the same, while the same pattern was followed.
The decline of 1.8 per cent in June in the restaurant trade was further worsened in July.
The pub and bar, which sold liquor, performed the strongest with more likes than the restaurant.
Food-driven pubs also had to suffer damage to the smoke, although the restaurants were not as dramatic as the managers.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The sales of all drinks in the pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, when a decrease of three per cent in the case of food was recorded.
Paul Newman, Space and Hospitality Analyst at RSM, said: "These results have continued the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The impact of the weather and major social or sports events makes it the biggest factor for sales in the market outside the home.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups have continued to struggle, though a year-on-year 4.8 per cent decline in sales, especially due to current cost pressures, will be painful.
The long summer weather could not have been the time and the bad weather of the food-content managers and the time alone will tell whether the more average temperature we experienced in August will provide the most essential relief."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openers in July, was 2.7 per cent, reflecting a slow pace in the brand roll-out.
The Coffre Peach Tracker collects and analyzes data from 47 operating groups exhibiting <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion of joint business to the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, and it is an established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The survey shows that one in five children — some of whom are under the age of 11 — have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in "freshy insta" pages.
There has been growing concern that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children — some of whom are under the age of 11 — are making social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
In a survey of 20,000 high school students, "fresh Instagram" accounts grew rapidly - a reference to a photo-sharing site's Instagram.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they run a clean "main" account to show their parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who suddenly saw her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, found that a teenager in it was urging others to "rape me."
A study by the Digital Aviation U.K. and The Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had profiles, half of which were accepted to keep private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's very disturbing that a lot of teens are being lured to make online places where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elidh Doyle will have a 'voice for athletes' on the Scottish Athletics Board
Elidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the Governing Body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most admired track and field athlete, and Chairman Ian Betty has given this step a great opportunity to those who guide the game to take advantage of its extensive international experience over the past decade.
"The Scottish, U.K. and World Athletics community has a lot of respect in Elidh's mind and we are confident that Athletics in Scotland will benefit them greatly from bringing them to the board."
"I am looking forward to working as the voice of the athletes and I hope that I can really contribute to and help guide the game in Scotland," said Doyle.
In addition to his four Olympic gold medals, the American and now regularly panned, who won the 200m and 400m races at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, became unable to walk after a momentary ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I had an accident.
I can't walk.
The doctors said the time will tell whether I will be okay or not and to what extent I can be right.
It was a daunting task, but learn to fully recover, walk again, and practice clutter today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Compared to the cows of mothers by breast pump advertising, there was a difference in the opinion of online people
A breast pump company shared an online opinion by an ad that compares breast feeding mothers to cow's milk by diluting the milk of cows.
To mark the launch of a product called "World's first silent wearable breast pump", consumer tech company Elvie has released a new funky music video-inspired ad, in which new pump mothers express themselves
Four real mothers dance on a song in the grassy meadow of cows, which includes some kind of saying: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not fat, it's my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pump It Out, Pump It Out, Iam Feeding Dam Babies, Pump It Out, Pump It Out, Iam Milking My Ladies."
Whatever the case, advertising, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed responses from viewers, many people said it presents the "fear" of the dairy industry in a light-hearted way.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
"Just like us, they need to be born to get pregnant and produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them only in the lunar days after giving birth," one wrote.
Elvie's Breast Pump Sucks Inside the Nursing Bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "Of course it's sad for both mother and baby.
But why not use them for advertising breast pumps for mothers who get the opportunity to keep their children in the care of their children?"
Someone else added: "What an irrelevant advertisement is."
Other people defended the ad, one of whom said that they thought the ad song was "smiling."
"I think it's a very good idea.
I would have had it, too, if I was still breastfeeding.
I feel like I'm being a cow by pumping.
This ad is a little weird, but I saw it the way it is.
One wrote that this is a good product."
The second commented: "It's a fun ad for those moms who are pumped (often in their workplace or toilet) and experience like "gay".
This is not a promotional or decisive advertisement for the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reported that they were dancing cautiously with pumps in their bra.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump breast say that they feel like they are a cow.
However, the Elvis pump remains well hidden, it does not have any wire or tube and directly carefully fits into a nursing bra, allows women to walk around without pumping, hold their children and even go out.
Commenting on the ECD in Anna Ballerin, Partner and Mother, ECD commented: "The Elve Pump is a revolutionary product, which deserves a stunning and brilliant launch.
Talking about the cows of women and dairy, parallelizing them, we want to bring the breast pumping and its challenges to the spotlight, displaying the feeling of freedom in an entertaining and related way, which brings the new pump.
This is not the first time that the Elvee pump has been in flames.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children using the product, designer Martha Jacobsky, had been seen catwalking for a catwalk.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly went to a tent camp on the border of Texas.
The spying on the captured migrant children, even when there is no change in the monthly border crossing, has made it difficult to appoint the children, to some extent because of the harsh curvature and policies presented by the Trump administration.
Traditionally, the maximum sponsors had appointed undocumented migrants themselves and were afraid to put their own ability to live in the country in jeopardy by claiming them on any child by moving forward.
The threat further escalated in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other busy or senior members of the house would have to give their fingerprints and the data would again be shared with immigration officials.
Last week, a senior officer of Matthew Albens, Immigration and Border Charge Enforcement presented evidence to the Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who had come to escort the unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal record in the past.
"Almost 80 percent of the people who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's household are illegally residing in the country and the most of them are criminals.
So we continue to search for those individuals," Mr. Elbens said.
Seeking to prepare the children quickly, the authorities introduced new rules according to which it was necessary to appear in court within a month of arrest of the children instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard according to the staff taken shelter.
Many people appear through video conference call instead of being personally presented to a non-immigrant judge in order to present their case for legal status. . . .
Those who are deemed unfit to be released are immediately released from prison.
The longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to be held hostage or disillusioned, which may be quantified in violent moods or attempts to escape, according to the report of the system in recent months.
Lawyers or lawyers said that those cases are taken to a higher facility such as Turnillo, where the sign that the child is struggling, they are ignored because of their size.
He also said that without giving children enough time to be emotionally prepared or saying goodbye to friends, taking them to the tent city will further increase the trauma with which they are already struggling.
Syria has asked the occupying military forces of the United States, France and Turkey to return immediately.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, even when the war in the country was now the eighth year.
Mulam, who also serves as a Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign military forces are illegally living on Syrian soil through the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated according to him."
"They should leave the war ground immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
"The war in Syria has almost ended," he said, "where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of people have been uprooted from their homes.
"Until then, Damascus will continue to fight this unnatural war as long as we do not clear all Syrian areas of both all terrorist groups and the presence of some foreigner," he said.
The United States has some 2,000 military forces in Syria, mainly to train and advise both Khurdish and Syrian military forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military forces on the ground in the country that was devastated by the war.
In the case of the refugees, Mulam said the conditions were right for them to return and he held "some Western countries" responsible for "distorting the poor", which inspired the refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return,"" he said."
"They were politicizing a fully humane case."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive any assistance for reconstruction until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
A recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the midst of Idlib’s last major uprising is an opportunity to put further pressure on the political dialogue, the United States says.
The Russo-Turkish deal or agreement avoided a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people lived.
However, Mulam said the agreement has a "clear timeline" and also expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from al-Qaida linked to the Nusaray front, who will be "mitted."
The representative of the United States, Mr Mistura, is expected to hold the first meeting of a new committee with members of the government and opposition to prepare a post-war constitution to fix the path of Syria and elections soon.
Mulalam has placed some conditions on the committee for the participation of the Syrian government, which has said that the work of the panel to "review the articles of the current Constitution" and issue a warning against interference should be restricted.
Why Trump will win in the second term
With that argument, Mr. Trump will win the election again in 2020, unless many liberals or elites are expecting any blame and fraud to end their term ahead of time.
"This is going to be the most dramatic finale of the national post so far!"

In the run-up to the election house, there was a flood of external money in the strong middle
It was not surprising that in the 17th Pennsylvania came a flood of money or cash, which was credited to the rebuilding of the Congress board, due to which two officers came forward for the race of the same seat.
Who recently opened the front for the Democratic Rap Coner Lamb of the suburban Pittsburgh district - who won his seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamps were also included in the race for another post, Republican Kath Rothfesse, who currently represents the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, which spans each other with the new 17th.
Following this decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January in the case of unconstitutional laxity in favor of the republican by the old districts, maps or maps were reconstructed.
In the new 17th race, the fight between the major finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) left the campaign's economy at bay.
The name of Lamb became quite popular in Pennsylvania after a landslide victory widely seen in the March 18th Congressional District special election in the state of Pennsylvania.
For this reason, the seat was occupied by the Republican for nearly a decade and President Donald Trump had won the district by 20 points.
Political pandits have provoked the democrats a little more.
U.S. to punish al-Salwador for supporting China, then back down
Officials have mentioned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing due to resistance by Washington, the statement said.
Mr. Trump held a congratulatory meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the Trump organization's management team pulled out the partners.
In a statement earlier this month, Department Spokesperson Heather Nort said that officials of the political department on the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan had made by Al Salvador, the Dominican Republic and the United States of the Cote d'Ivoire mission from Panama.
But only Al Salvador was fined, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including narcotics control, development and financial assistance.
The proposed penalty, which included targeting cuts and visa restrictions in financial assistance, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
When progress was made in internal meetings or meetings, the North American and Central American officials in the form of the previous year shifted to the same gathering or gathering of the people in the form of a high-level conference, which focused on security and economic prosperity,
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead and effectively end up considering any punishment or punishment for al-Salwador.
Officials said that Vice President Mike Pence is now ready to address the conference, which is now scheduled to be held in mid-October, in an indication of importing administrative seats at the conference.
And three Americans returned from Washington without any harsh message or punishment to the quiet of Al Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic.
The White House spokesperson for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the debate or dispute details described by three US officials, including two politicians, who agreed to discuss the internal idea on condition of not clarifying the name.
Their accounts have been confirmed by an external analyst, who is close to the administration and also speaks on condition of not clarifying the name.
The history of study
The next case could be the report of Special Council Robert Mueller on possible resistance to the justice of Mr. Trump, of which there is now sufficient evidence in the public record.
At the same time, according to Mr. Mueller's report, they change the direction of their investigation that if Mr. Trump's campaign is aligned with Russia in order to attack our elections.
When the Congress gets together, Mr. Trump finds himself held accountable in that body, when he prepares himself again to go before the voters and perhaps before a jury of his co-workers.
Of course, there are many ifs or ifs and ifs and I do not mean to signal or suggest that the collapse of Mr. Trump and his counterparts in Europe is not inevitable.
We all have options to choose from on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict may be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to march against Hitler, only if he was opposed from the West and supported by Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, as a result of which we missed the opportunity to stop the tragedy of so many years.
The system of historical central points around such conflicting points and the extraordinary march of democracy are accelerated or delayed in it.
Americans now have to face many of these conflicting points.
If Mr. Trump resigns from the job of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosentin, the person who controls the final outcome of Mr. Mueller's investigation, what will we do?
Rosentin has been in this confusion since this paper reported it last year, he secretly suggested that he keep the president's record and consider his being unfit for office.
Mr. Rosentin said that the account of the Times is not accurate.
"If the F.B.I. investigation of Brett Quangogh recently requested is not complete or fair - or if he remains firm in the Supreme Court despite the verifiable allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony, how will we respond?"
And most of all, will we vote for the Congress in the medium term, for which Mr. Trump will be responsible?
If we fail to do so, democracy will last for a long time.
But I don't think we'll fail because of the lessons I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, who was settled in Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, who had also once captured my ambassador’s house.
She lived and went to the United States and after 60 years she sent me to burn soap candles on a table that was self-contained.

The knee injury prevents Midfielder Graham Duran from appearing for the first time in the season up to a 2-2 tie with Viral, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for big things.
"It was a good thing for us because the vilarials were good," the 31-year-old said.
"We went forward in the game with the belief that we can achieve something and reach some conclusion.
Maybe we can finally get it, but overall, the draw will probably be a fair result.
They were probably better in the first period and we were even better in the second period.
Moving towards Thursday, it's a second big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they got good results with our back crowd or crowd in their previous game, I'm sure we'll play well and get positive results.
Whatever happened with my injuries and with the changes made to the club itself was certainly difficult last year but now there is a good experience in this place.
The squad is good and the boys are really enjoying it; they have got good training.
I hope that now we can move forward and succeed by leaving our last session behind."
Women are losing their sleep because of the fear of this retirement saving.
Despite the fact that survey participants clearly know what kind of care they need, some people were talking about it to their family members.
More than half of the people across the country said they were talking to their partners about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them or take care of them, but they don’t take any steps to negotiate,” said Holi Sinder, vice president of life insurance business across the country.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You won’t be able to prepare your family to take care of them if you don’t tell them your wishes ahead of time.
Discuss with your counselor and your family where and how to get care, as they can be an important factor in determining the cost of options.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also advise you on ways to pay for those expenses.
For long-term care, your financing options have a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy, to help pay these expenses or to insure your own health.
Introduce your legal documents: Make your legal battle easier.
Get a health-care proxy, so you can appoint a trusted person to take care of your medical care and make sure that if you are unable to communicate or interact, the professional must comply with your wishes.
At the same time, consider the power of attorney to monitor your finances.
You will choose a reliable person to make financial decisions for yourself and ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to.
Don’t forget the little-to-little information: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and they are taken to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions related to their medications and allergies?
Tell that information in the written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just a financial role, but who's the doctor?" Martin asked.
"What medicines are given?"
Who will take care of the dog?
Is there a plan?"

Earthquakes and tsunamis in indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia's city on Friday and the death toll is expected to rise further.
Upon closing the communication, the defence officer was unable to obtain any information from the Dongala Regency, the northern area of the Palu which, is near the supercenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In the fall, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from the rubble.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017, located on the west coast of Sulawesi Island on the shore of a narrow bay.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
The Dongala Sulawesi Island is a regency on the beach in the northwest of the island, which has spread across an area of more than 300 kilometers (180 miles).
The administrative province has an estimated population of 299 in the Regency below, which was 200 in 2017.
The main basis of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province was fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of the Dongala.
Nickel mining in the province is also very important, but it is concentrated in Morovli on the beaches opposite the maximum solubility.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Allocation Agency, Sunami has stabbed several times in Palu and Dongala in the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people became known due to tsunami in Dongala and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
Sunami also stabbed nine people in western Dongala in 1996.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire from an earthquake perspective and regularly hits the spot of the earthquake. . . .
Here's a look at the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's AK province in northern Sumatra struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coastline, half of whom were in AK.
2005: A series of intense earthquakes also hit the western shores of Sumatra in early March and April.
Hundreds were killed on the island of Niyas on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Indonesia's most populous island, Java, came a magnitude 6.8 tsunami, activating a tsunami in Java, which hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake near the city of Padang has affected the area that is the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the island of Mentawai on the coast of Sumatra affected the area, causing dozens of villages to collapse in the area of Sunami up to 10 meters and killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow water earthquake in the AK attacked the Pidi Jaya Regency, causing destruction and devastation as a result of which people remembered the terrible earthquake of 2004 and the destruction or devastation of the tsunami.
No tsunamis came this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings or buildings.
2018: Intense earthquakes on the tourist island of Indonesia, in Lombok, devastated everything, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern direction of the island.
Bhunkap destroyed thousands of buildings and helped thousands of tourists for some time.

On Friday, at least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
This 7.5-magnitude earthquake activated the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
In the coming days, the death rate was also not working as well as electricity and communications networks.

Federal Prosecution Seeks Rare Death Penalty for Suspects of NYC Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a rare death penalty for Saifulo Sipov, a suspect in the inmate attack on New York City that killed eight people -- a virtual punishment that has been given in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Cypov, 30, allegedly uses a home depot rental truck to attack from the bike on the westbound highway in Manhattan, cutting off pedestrians and cyclists in October.
According to the information of intent to demand the death penalty imposed in the southern district of New York, in order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors have to prove that Sipov has "reasonably" killed eight victims and "reasonably" tortured them
These two countries, according to the court document, give a possible death penalty.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury struck down Sipov from Chanta for 22 charges, including eight counts of murder for aiding in racketeering, which are especially used in organized crime cases and to commit violence and motor vehicle massacres.
Prosecutors said that the attack needed to "enough planning and discussion of preconceived ideas", explaining the manner in which the Sipoo executed it in a way that was "stupid, cruel and evil".
"Safuluo Habibulavik Sipoo, Diego Enric Angelini, Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Cleves Enlor Dekat, Deren Drake, Ariel Allierz, Harn<0xC3><0xA1>n Feruk<0xC3><0xAD>, Harn<0xC3><0xA1>n Diego Mendoza and Eloz<0xC3><0xA1>n
Five of the victims were tourists, who were from Argentina.
The case has been going on for a decade on the death penalty case in New York's southern district.
Mulzim Khalid Bren was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In 1953, the last time in the New York federal case for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg was sentenced to death, a married-married couple found guilty of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Zones Rosenberg was sentenced to death by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
A local resident of Uzbekistan, Sipov did not have a complaint or complaint for days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
The police said he told the investigators that he liked whatever he did.
Sipov told officials that he was motivated to attack after watching the ISIS video while meeting the crime on his phone.
Police said they had also asked to show ISIS flags in their hospital room.
He asked not to be guilty of the 22- counts offence.
David Patton, one of the federal public watchdogs representing Sipoov, says he is "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that seeking the death penalty instead of accepting life imprisonment without any possibility of being released will only delay the mental trauma of these events to include all," Patton said.
The defence team of Sipov had earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be made operational for Brexit talks
Nigel Faraz vowed to 'collect an army of people' during the protest at the Tory Conference.
The Eastern Ukip leader asked politicians to 'understand the environment' from Eurosceptics - because one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that they should negotiate with the European Union.
Backbencher Peter Bone, a columnist, told reporters in Birmingham in March that if Mr. Farage was Brexit secretary, Britain would have been 'outside' by now.
But the challenges faced by Smt. Me in solving their highly divided rank have been outlined by Pro-Rimen Tory to join a separate opposition against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his checker's settlement plan on track during the attacks from Brexiteers, the European Union and the European Union.
The allies urged that he would try to reach an agreement with Brussels rather than backlash - and that Eurosceptics and workers would hesitate to choose between their package and the chaos.
Mr. Bone said that leaving means leaving the rally in Solihall, in which he wants to 'Fenkan to the shakers'.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be made a partner and he should be given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have been out so far," he said.
Welingboro MP or MP said: "I will stand for Brexit but we need to get the checkers out."
Setting its opposition in the European Union, he said: "We don't need to be subjected to anyone to fight a world war."
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bone rejected all the suggestions that changed public opinion after the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins was also quoted as saying in March: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister Ji, listen to the people.
"We're not popular with the people, the opposition won't vote for it because it's not so prevalent between our party and our activists who actually roam the streets and elect us in the first place.
Please leave the checkers and start listening.'
In a focused message to Smt., he said: The Prime Minister keeps his jobs when they do not break his promise.'
Mr. Farage said that the leaders of the rally should be made 'aware of the environment', if they cheat with the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter between our people and our political groups," he said.
"They're trying to trick Brexit and today we're here to tell them that 'we're not going to let you run away doing that.'
"I want you to create our political class, which is on the cusp of cheating Brexit by understanding the environment,"" he told the crowd."
"We are organizing the army of the people of this country who have given us victory in Brexit and who do not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Remainers march from Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the middle of the city.
A group of workers signaled the tories against the Brexit banner after the group's launch this weekend.
The opening of the Labour Party's Lord Adonis Conference shows the need to negotiate for security issues arising from the party app.
"These are the people who tell us that they have the right IT system for Canada, the unresisting border and the unrestricted free trade in Ireland, and all the technology.
"It's a full swing.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton has finished the world title after winning the team at Sebastien Wetl
From that moment it became clear that Valterie Bottas was eligible to play a major role in the Lewis Hamilton Mercedes Team Order Race on Saturday.
From Paul, Bottas made a good start and kicked Hamilton out as he made his place in the first two laps and invited Vatel to create a barrier in his team's drivers.
Wettal first went to the pits and left Hamilton in traffic behind the pack, something that should be decisive.
Mercedes was a lap back and came out of the back of Wettel but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action which saw that Farry's driver unwittingly defended on the third corner. A double-deck is left without a risk
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in sixth place when he reached the end of the lap before his 21st birthday.
Then he moved on to a large part of the race when he focused on changing his tire in it and quickly moved out of Kimi Raconon in fourth place.
He eventually came in the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps, when Reconnen took fourth place.
It was a difficult day when Valterie did a great job all weekend and is a really good gentleman.
The team did a great performance by getting one or two, Hamilton said.
It was really a very bad feeling.
President Donald Trump on Saturday lied to Senator Dean Fenstein at his request, he did not leak the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which he was accused of sexually abusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly address the statement letter given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead he commented on the Senate's current situation, saying that people are "meaningful and bad and believable."
"A very good thing or thing that can happen in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry, mean and evil and unfaithful people," he said.
"When you see the release and leak and then they say, 'Hey, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dean Fynstein, did you miss it?
The answer is... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
"We didn't, we didn't, we didn't," he said, pointing to the senator.
Fenstein was sent a letter of explanation of the charges brought against Kavanaugh by Ford back in July and it was leaked in early September - but Fenstein denied that it had been leaked from the office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak his story," Fenstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I have kept it confidential as he said."
But the president did not feel his rejection was justified, commenting on Saturday night's rally: "I'm telling you it was really a very bad mood.
Maybe he hasn't done that, but I've hardly ever seen such a bad mood before."
Continuing his defence of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President said that the Democrat was using the allegations on his part.
"They are determined to recover power by any means necessary."
You see their insignificance, their bullshit and also that they don't care who they hurt or who they're running after to get power or power or control," the mediator said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundy Star 5-3 Belfast Giant
Patrick Dever scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundy Stars on Saturday won a 5-3 return match in Dundy to compensate for Friday's loss to the elite league against the Belfast Giants.
The Giants gained two goals in the first round through the attacks from Patrick Doer and Francis Buvilier.
Prior to the Gentleman's lead, Mike Sullivan and Jordan took home side level before re-establishing the Crownier.
Before securing a two-goal win by Lucas Lundwalt Nilsson, Francos Boschard equalised it for Dondy.
It was Adam Kefe's third loss of the season to the men, who came from behind on Friday night to defeat Dundy 2-1 in Belfast.
With Janit winning the last three matches, it was the fourth meeting of the session on the sides.
The opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Candel MacFol, in which David Raderford helped Buvilier double up in the next four minutes.
In the busy initial period, Sullivan performed his home game back at 13:10 before coming equal to Connie at 15:16 of Matt Mercury.
Doer makes sure that by the end of the first period by him the Giants make their second goal of the night up in the first rest.
The domestic side is regrouped and Bushard once again takes them to the level period with the power play round at 27:37.

Air traffic controllers were killed to ensure that hundreds of people could escape from the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero or hero since he was killed in making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people could be landed safely on the ground.
On Friday, more than 800 people were killed and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck Sumami on the island of Sulawesi.
The post-war attacks in the area were continuing to destroy and many people were trapped beneath the rubble in the city of Palu.
But while his colleagues were running to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Ang refused to leave his post busy controlled at Mutiyara Sis al-Zufri Airport, Palu Airport.
He was there to ensure that the Betik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could land safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower, when he thought it was about to fall.
Later, he died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirtrat, said hundreds of people could have survived the decision, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take them to a larger hospital from the other city.
Unfortunately, we lost them before we reached the heliport of the helicopter.
"Our hearts were broken when we left," he said.
Meanwhile, officials are afraid that the death toll with the destruction of the country could reach thousands, the Alpikatan agency says access to Dongala, Sigi and Botosh is limited.
"The death rate may still rise because many bodies may still be buried in debris or debris, or many places where it cannot be reached," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Nugharoho.
Rising waves of up to six meters led to the collapse of the volcano, which caused a mass grave on Sunday.
The military and commercial aircraft are bringing assistance and supplies.
Resa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance was carrying bodies.
It is rare to get clean water.
Small and medium-sized markets were being looted everywhere."
Jain Galfand, head of the International Red Cross, told CNN: "Indonesia is running to help Red Cross survivors, but we don't know what they'll get there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Vidodo arrived in Pulu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I am asking you all to work day and night to complete every task related to getting out or emptying you.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year in Indonesia, the quake hit Lobonk, killing about 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niyugini now says a man has been missing since the lagoon plane crash
The airline, which operates a plane crash-landed in the Pacific Lagoon in Macedonia, now says a man is missing when it was last reported that 47 passengers and crew or driver were safely removed from the plane by sinking.
Air Niugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it could not identify a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local officials, hospitals and investigators to identify the man, according to the report.
The airline does not immediately respond to the request for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
While attempting to land at the wrong island airport when the plane fell into the water, local ships helped to save the other passengers and crew.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were in hospital on Saturday and all of them are now in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the nature of the incident is unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the two planes did not land properly on the runway.
Some witnesses or eyewitnesses thought that the plane did not land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jenn said the plane had come down too low.
Jane said, "It's a very good thing."
Jane said she and others were taken out of the deep water from the emergency exit present on the plane while diving.
He said that the plane's personnel were horrified and were screaming and he felt a slight injury to the head.
The U.S. Navy said the vessels working around the ghat to make the ghat better also helped to save people by using an airship to bring people to shore in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water before the plane sank.
Data from the aviation security network indicate that 111 people have been killed in the crash of PNG-registered airline in the past two decades but none were involved in air pollution.
The analyst told the time of night when the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution on Saturday remanded its case to prosecute a man on charges of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014 for remanding her case.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Roulette presented evidence for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigation analysis.
She told the jury how she used the phone records to bring together 29-year-old Mulzim Quinton Teles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of her death.
"Rolett said he received location data from several cell phones, which shows that he was with the Talis Chambers on the night of his death while denying his previous claims," the Clearian-Laser reported.
When the data shows that when she said she was with her friend Michelle Sanford, at the time she was near her cell phone chambers, the police told Sanford.
Sanford came forward on Saturday and presented his statement and evidence that he was not in the city that day.
Asked by the prosecutors that if Tillis is telling the truth, when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was "talking lies because his truck was in Nashville."
The second inconsistency was that Talis said he already knew Chambers about two weeks before his death.
The phone records show that they had known each other for a week.
Some time after Chamber's death, Tillis has removed all of Chamber's text or message, call or contact information from his phone.
Hel said, "He took her out of his life."
The defense is ready to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected to go to the jury to hear the case on that day.

The other black man?!
NY Naini sues on double pair after firing after "arbitrary" text
When a New York Naini complains by a mother that she is "the second black person", she sues on a pair of twins for sideline marking after misleading texting.
Couples refuse to accept that they are resisting, to sue for "attraction."
Lindsay Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, learns that Giselle Morris, who is taking care of new children, is expressing her underwear, which was black on her first day of work in 2016.
"No other black man," Mrs. Plasco Flaxman told her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Morris.
According to a New York post, after realizing his oblivion, a "disgusting" Plasco-Flexman pulled Mrs. Morris out, stating that her outgoing nanny, who was African-American, has done a bad job and she has done a bad job.
Mrs. Morris was sent home in April, paying for her one-day work.
Now, Morris demands a salary of $350 a day to get out of work on the couple and for six months, though he was hired to start work on a live-in gig without a contract.
"Look, I want to show them that you don't do any of this work," he said in a post on Friday, saying that "I know it's discrimination."
The couple on the claims that they are racists, stating that after insulting him they could not trust him, it was proper to terminate Maurice's employment.
"My wife had sent something that he didn't mean.
He is not a racist.
We are not racist people," said the husband who told Plasco the post.
But can you give your children into the hands of someone you have ever insulted, even if it has gone wrong?
What's your new baby?
Let go of it."
Like the "attraction" lawsuit, Plasco said his wife has only been having a baby for two months and she is in a "very difficult situation".
"You're going after someone like that?"
It's not right to do that," the investment banker said.
While the legal case is still going on, he has given a quick response to blaming the couple on social media while keeping them silent for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddyston is worried that the reader will not add it to his own thoughts and opinions, the new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born after the book was approved, said in the letter: "It's hard to think of having someone put their own place in reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's amazing to know about Pandington's success."
Talking about his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book inspired by the toy of a little bear, he was optimistic about his rejection of his work, he said that after his death he was "in the 60th year of publication of his book".
About Paddington, about whom she describes as "an important member of her family", she tells that her father was proud of her potential success.
"He was a quiet man and wasn't proud at all," he said.
"But because Pandington was so real to them, it was almost like you had a kid who gets what he gets: you're proud of them, even though you're not really doing it.
I think he's seen Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was his imagination and creation, he always gave Paddington credit for it."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, his daughter was taken to the Luis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the work done by the doctors was futile.
"Nad was regularly saying that it was really bad, there was no such expectation," said Mrs. Adnan-Laperous.
"Then Nad phoned me and told me that he was going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tasi, I love you very much, son.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs that doctors had given her to beat her heart were slowly ending up leaving her system in a state of shock.
She had died a while ago and it was all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, even though I knew it was going to end.
I couldn’t do anything to cry, cry or cry, because I was surrounded by people from my family.
I had to take care of everyone."
Finally, Mrs. Adnan-Laparus, who was saddened by the loss of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of the situation they were going through.
"No one knows," he said.
"I put my head down and cried all the time.
It was hard to express, but I got to see a sense of extreme compassion for Nad on the plane.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."

When the FBI investigation began, Kavanaugh's future was tied up in the next century
"I thought, if I could really find something he's looking for - a limited time and a limited scope check - maybe we could bring a little unity," said Mr. Fleck on Saturday and also that he was afraid that the accused sidelined Gridlock was "between"
Why did Mr. Kavangua and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
It was because of his untimely death.
The midterm elections were only five weeks away, on November 6 - as expected, the Republicans perform very badly, so they would be seriously weakened in their efforts to win the High Court on the ground.
George calls to call the W.W. Bush Senator, promotes him to support Mr. Kuwangua, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him meets his wife, Eshley, who is the private secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happened after the FBI presented its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear that Mr. Kuwangua could get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which Mike Pence, the Vice President, had to finish it and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's 'Kim' has been 'broken' by North Koreans
North Korea, which has been in South Korea since its arrival in power seven years ago, has declined in the number of fugitives, a South Korean official said.
Referring to the Ministry of Integration of the South, Park Beyong-Siyong said 1,127 people have left their duties in 2011 compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strong border between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by the Taskers and Chinooks were the main factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comment.
A large number of refugees from the North are finally offered citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War since 1953.
The maximum China has fled, the border of which is the longest with North Korea and it is easy to cross the heavily protected zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their own country by forcing them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - have seen improvements in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries meet in Pyongyang for talks, which focuses on the stalled nuclear-armed talks.
It came into effect in June after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Singapore's Kim Jong-un, when they broadly agreed to terms of working towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Rei Yang-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"Without any faith in America, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances, we will have no way but to achieve unilateral damage first," Mr. Ray said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelori called Brett Kavanaugh "beautiful", he said he is not fit for the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court's candidate Brat Kwangua "beautiful" and said he was inherently unfit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made a comment on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think a month can do such a performance, they call it 'fun'," Pelosi said on Thursday in response to Kavanaugh's evidence before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had ever sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers, the source said.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes stopping screaming and breathing while talking about his family and his school years.
He was clearly punished on the committee by liberals for lying about allegations of "weird and coordinated character covertness", which was angered by Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he feels that Kavanaugh's witnesses have proved that he cannot work in the Supreme Court, as it shows that he is acting against the Democrat.
"I think he made himself unfit with those statements and the way he went to Clinton and the Democratic Party," he said.
Pelosi expressed doubt that if Kavangua becomes permanent when asked, and if the Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives, he will still hold Kavangua guilty.
"I would say that -- if he doesn't tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not fit for the Supreme Court, but because he's invited, he can work right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat, he was concerned about the potential rules of Kwangua against the charitable care of Act or Ro V. Wed, as he is known to do conservative justice.
In the wake of his certification, Kavanaugh dismissed questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"In hearing his confirmation, Kavangua dismissed the questions raised about whether he would reverse some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
And women need to shake it up.
This is a religious objection, the anger of months and years goes out and she can’t stop herself from crying.
Mrs. Stamin said to me 45 years later, "When we cry, we get angry."
"I don't think that's unusual, do you think?"
She was saying, "A woman helped me a great deal by working with an officer somewhere, who said that even when she gets angry, she cries, but she has developed a new technique, which means that when she gets angry and she starts crying, she's going to cry what she's going to say to the person she was talking to."
I'm angry."
And then she spoke.
And I thought it was very good."
Tears are allowed to come out as part of anger because they are fundamentally misconceived.
An introductory job, one of my sharpest memories of a man’s principal office, when I found myself crying in an indescribable rage, found that an old woman had grabbed my neck from behind. A sharp manager who had always been a bit stiffer than me.
He said, "Don't cry in front of anyone."
"They don't know how strong you are.
They think you’re sad and you’ll be happy to meet them.”
Patricia Shrader, a woman president of the Democratic Congress from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on the presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught making a connection in a boat or a name called Manki Business other than marriage and his name was taken back from the race, Mrs. Sroder, who was extremely disappointed, himself took part in the race of the President.
“It wasn’t a thought-provoking decision,” she said laughing at me after 30 years.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called him "Sno White and Sevan Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was delayed, he did not have time to raise money and so he swore that until he collected $2 million, he would not participate in the race.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his supporters who had given the men $1,000, they would only give him $250.
"Do they think I've got a release?" he wondered.
When he made his speech announcing that he would not launch any formal campaign, he could not resist the emotions - thanks to those who gave it to him, disillusionment with the system that made it difficult for him to raise money and even to get rid of it instead of the representatives
"You would have thought that I would have to take a nervous break down," Mrs. Sroder recalled how the press would have reacted about them.
"You would have thought that Clenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they were going to put on my ass.
"Did he cry?"
How U.S.-China trade could be good for Beijing
The beginning of the trade war between the US and China was slowing down and while the war is still far from over, the gap between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts said.
U.S. President Donald Trump said the first warning was given earlier this year by imposing a major Chinese export tax, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase this week is effectively taxed on more than half of all goods coming from China to the U.S., affecting items of up to $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion).
Beijing has taken a backlash every time in its own way, most recently with a five to 10 percent slipping tariff of $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has promised to match the US shot-by-shot and the world's second-largest economy is likely to remain in place soon.
Getting back to Washington means digging up demands, but publicly bowing your head in front of the U.S. would be very shameful for the president of China, Zi Jingping.
Still, experts say that Beijing can go its own way, the U.S. trade war can positively support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of two economies in a positive way.
"It's a fact that a quick political decision on Washington or Beijing can create situations that either initiate economic telespin in the country, which is actually even more dangerous than what the audience has seen before," said Abigel Ayrka, a researcher at Aamirka.
"Syria is 'ready' to return refugees, the foreign minister said."
Syria has said it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help in rebuilding the country that has been ravaged by war for more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulm said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure because of the progress made against anti-terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore the normal situation.
Due to terrorism, all circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people living in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Maulam said the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that are sponsoring the uprising.
Europe wins the Rider's Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Rider's Cup at the Le Golf National in Paris, France from 16.5 to 10.5, the last score of the U.S. Open.
The U.S. has now faced six consecutive defeats on European soil and has not won the Rider's Cup in Europe since 1993.
When the Danish captain Thomas Jordan reaches the 14.5 points needed to defeat the American, Europe once again gains its title. . . .
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled in the tournament's maximum, showed his T-shot in the water at 3 16th hole by accepting a match from Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds by becoming 1 out of 4 players to score 5-0-0 so far after starting the current format of the tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spith was defeated 5 and 4 by Denmark's Thorbzon Oleson, the lowest-ranked player in the European team.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Donson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Lane Polter, who had probably played his last rider's cup.
An experienced of the eight-rider cup, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the European who wins every time in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop myself.
It was a difficult year.
So thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It’s about the team, and I’m very happy that I helped,” Greece said emotionally after the European victory.
He beat his partner John Ram Mashal Thamai, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in the singles play on Sunday.
23-year-old Rahm said, "I'm incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I'm grown up to see them."
Wood lost all four of his matches in France and now he has 13-21-3 career rider cup records.
One of the greatest players so far has only won 14 major titles in second place after Jack Nicholas.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find the fairway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finneu, who played golf with the entire caliber throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furk said after his squad's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
In the morning we put some pressure on Europe.
We have defeated them.
Congrats to Thomas.
He is a good captain.
All 12 of his players played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will work with America's PGA and Riders Cup Committee and move forward with Thosm.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You should congratulate them.
We played better."
