This is not exactly what I wanted.
Is it yours?

Everybody's lying.
I took the first step.
Would you like a fruit juice?
Can you help us?
Stay calm.
One day it will be mine.
I've had enough of everything!
That was awful.
I won't let you do that.
How was the time of the French?

That's the absolute truth!
All shields.
That's your problem.
It hurts.
Stay calm.
Turn left at the next corner.
How long have you been here?
Sit down.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

You promised you'd help me.
He was a bare-breasted and boss.
I don't know why my head hurts.
Tom is crazy about Mary.
Are you a Uyghur?
Don't be mad.
As it came, so it went.

You never know what will happen tomorrow.
Thanks for the email!

Why didn't you say that right away?
You're sad.
