Named the number of newcomers preparing to send to Donbass from Ukraine
The official representative of the People’s Police of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) Andrei Marochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine will send at least 3 thousand new recruits to Donbass.
According to him, Kiev plans to "at least somehow reassemble the units".
"The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass layoffs have led to low complementarity of units," said Marochko, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians called for army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev began the so-called Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the Joint Forces Operation (JO).
It was assumed that this measure would lead to the strengthening of the role of Ukrainian forces in the settlement of the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbass worsened due to the murder of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities described what had happened as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the diversion was organized by the Ukrainian special services.
U.S. authorities have forced Mask to leave the post of chairman of Tesla's board
American businessman Elon Musk will step down as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors at the request of the U.S. authorities.
To settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the entrepreneur will also pay $20 million.
According to CNBC, the pre-trial agreement with the agency allows Mask to remain in the leadership position at Tesla.
At the same time, he is required to pay $20 million and leave the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors for 45 days from the date of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed in his place.
It is stated that the agreement should still be approved by the court.
On September 28, it became known that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Musk of misleading shareholders by claiming that there was sufficient funds to buy the company’s shares and filed a lawsuit against the entrepreneur.
It’s about a businessman’s post on Twitter, where he said he wanted to buy Tesla shares for $420 apiece, but he didn’t.
After the tweet, the company grew by almost 11%.
The head of the British Foreign Ministry compared the EU to the Soviet Union and the prison
Britain’s foreign minister Jeremy Hunt compared the EU to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing member states of the community.
With such a statement, the diplomat spoke at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
As the Daily Mail notes, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not let anyone leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not decrease, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity,” the minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave the EU would only aggravate the crisis, Gazeta.ru notes.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May said Brexit talks had come to a standstill.
Thus she commented on the results of the informal EU summit in Salzburg.
The Brexit decision was made in 2016 following a referendum.
The UK’s exit is expected to take place by April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by a number of factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the issue of the Irish border remains open.
Two dogs donated to the President of South Korea for receiving mushrooms from the DPRK
South Korean President Moon Jae-in received a gift from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un from two puppies after a visit to Pyongyang.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to a representative of the South Korean president’s administration.
"During the summit, a couple of dogs of the phounsan breed were offered as a gift.
On Thursday, they were received," the ministry said.

The gift was made in honor of the inter-Korean summit, which took place from September 18 to 20 in Pyongyang.
The hunting breed is a phoenix from North Korean wolves and has received its name from one of the districts of the DPRK.
According to the agency, Moon loves animals, he already has two such dogs, which he was given by the past leader of North Korea Kim Jong-il.
Dogs are not the only gift.
Kim Jong-un also gave his colleague two tons of delicate matsutake mushrooms.
He ordered that these mushrooms be distributed to members of families divided during the Korean War who had not yet reunited with their relatives from the DPRK.
The head of the Altai Rural Council stopped the hunger strike in defense of the interests of the residents
The MP said on his Facebook page that he had stopped starving for several reasons.

Also, the residents of the village council composed and brought to the governor of Altai region a mass collective appeal, “in the face of the catastrophic situation that has arisen”.
Boronin himself reported that he felt normal, his duties of the head during the hunger strike were fully fulfilled.

However, so far, no one has started this work.
The head of the village council also protested against the lack of proper control and support from the Altai region government and against the financial policy of Gazprommezhregiongas Novosibirsk.
In addition to the proper preparation of the villages for the winter, Boronin demanded “immediately to organize in the territory of the municipality a full independent section of the communal economy with the corresponding staff units”.

Telegram users complained of a failure in the work of the new version
iPhone users complained about problems in the work of Telegram Messenger after the update, which was released on September 28.
The user's phone number can be found by its user name
Complaints relate to gadgets with the current iOS 12 operating system.
According to their owners, after the update, the app displays a white screen or closes immediately.
The messenger's representatives responded to the crash.
According to them, the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new app written in Swift.
In Telegram, the automatic update of the application was temporarily suspended until the malfunctions were resolved.
On April 13, the Tagan court of Moscow satisfied Roskomnadzor’s lawsuit about blocking Telegram’s messenger in Russia.
Three days later, the liaison officers began to execute the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the messenger administration to provide the FSB with the keys to decipher the correspondence necessary to obtain data on terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of the suspect in the terrorism of the user when receiving the relevant court decision.
Telegram audience after blocking in Russia decreased by 1.2 million

Elon Musk is forced to resign as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their dispute over the fraud case.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the TV channel, within the framework of the agreements reached, Mask will have to leave the post of head of the board of directors of Tesla.
At the same time, the commission allowed Mask to retain the post of head of Tesla.
As noted, the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative penalty of $20 million.
A similar amount will be raised with Tesla.
The money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur who is one of the 50 richest people on the planet according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of SpaceX, the neurotechnological company Neuralink, and the developer of Tesla electric cars, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has previously referred Tesla CEO Ilona Mask to court for his tweet about the company’s possible buyout.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The stock price of $420 was set “due to the significance of this number in the marijuana culture,” Bloomberg reported earlier, citing the co-director of the Commission’s security department Steven Peykin.
At the same time, Elon Musk subsequently refused to buy the shares.
Commenting on a lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said he found the allegations of fraud unfounded, adding that he was very disappointed and disappointed by these claims.
“Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts prove that I have not violated it in any way,” a businessman told CNBC.
At the same time, in August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective lawsuit against Mask, complaining of financial losses incurred.
The Estonians claimed that the posts of the businessman brought them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders stated that the tweets of the businessman were misleading, which forced Tesla’s stock sellers to buy paper at artificially overpriced prices to cover their positions.
Other claimants also noted that Ilona Mask’s careless statements led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Ilona Maska also accused the head of research company Citron Research in stock exchanges.
Meanwhile, if Musk could not settle his dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he would be threatened with removal from the company’s management and even prison.
This was reported by former Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt, in particular, to CNBC.
Musk is a "good guy who can't run a car company."

In the RPC compared the possible renaming of the UOC with the actions of the fascists
Head of the Department of External Church Relations (OVCS) of the Moscow Patriarchate Metropolitan Volokolamsky Ilarion compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists in Germany.
Metropolitan Volokolamsky Ilarion - on the causes of the conflict with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, possible ecclesiastical division and its political subtext
According to him, now that the "conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in an acute stage", to rename the church is still the same as in fascist Germany "to pin the yellow six-pointed star to the Jews".
"This means marking the church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created," the representative of the Russian Orthodox Church said on the Russian TV channel "Russia 24".
The Metropolitan also stressed that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, because “the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country.”
UOC calls on Constantinople exarchs to leave its territory

Over the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing bullid.

Also, the vice-president of the government shared an opinion about the return of Daniel Kvyat to "Toro Rosso" and appreciated the visit of the Russian stage "Formula-1".
The result of our meeting with automakers should be in the foreseeable future the creation of the Russian carmaker "Formula-1", which has no analogues in the world, - said Dmitry Kozak.
We need to simplify our car manufacturers in this direction.
It was about plans until 2024, but I don’t think that’s possible at such a time.
I think the more realistic deadlines will be within the next ten years.”
From 2012 to 2014 the team "Marusya" performed in "Formula-1" under the Russian license.
According to the vice-premier, there are already investors ready to invest in the creation of a domestic team in the world championship of motorsport in the class "Formula-1".
I know that in Russia there are fans of motor sport, wealthy businessmen who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian team "Formula-1", - he noted.
“We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we have a team like this.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team came up, among other things, because in Sochi there was such an infrastructure.”
Tomorrow, the "Sochi Autodrom" is waiting for the anshlag.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to implement all 50 thousand tickets.
Look, even on the qualifications of the tribunes were almost filled, - said the Deputy Prime Minister.
I can say that revenue this year has increased by 72% compared to last year.
This is a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to increase the efficiency of the use of Sochi Autodrom infrastructure throughout the year.
This will be an additional tourist product that will bring even more appeal to Sochi.
Did not bypass Dmitry Kozak and the main theme of the day for Russian fans of motorsport - the return of Daniel Kvyat to "Toro Rosso".
“We all congratulate Daniel and wish him success next season,” said Deputy Prime Minister Izvestiam.
He is a very hopeful driver.
Next year, for the first time in history, two main Russian pilots will be able to take part in the Peloton "Formula-1" immediately.
Although the future fate of Sergey Sirotkin in the "Royal Races" remains unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not yet impressive: he took 18th place in the Russian Grand Prix qualification.
We will hope that next season our main drivers will be more than this year,” said Dmitri Kozak.

By the way, the release of penicillin from mold fungi was not the first discovery of Fleming.
A few years earlier, being frozen, he planted a mucus from his own nose on a petri dish (this is a glass lid in which experiments are conducted with bacteria) and a few days later he discovered that the bacteria there had been destroyed.
In the same way, penicillin was discovered.
Fleming's name was included in the list of the 100 most outstanding figures in the history of mankind.
His discovery, according to many scientists, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin medicine began to cope with most of the oldest diseases, previously considered incurable, - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming came to the French capital in 1945, the Parisian newspapers wrote: “For the defeat of fascism and the liberation of France, he did more than dozens of divisions.”
According to experts, Fleming’s discovery of the world’s first antibiotic has saved the lives of more than 200 million people on Earth.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 of a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous London Cathedral of St. Paul.
Where, by the way, our husband and wife paid attention to this was addressed by a vocabulary Russian-speaking tour guide.
And a few years later, the statue of Alexander Fleming in full growth we had to observe in the most unexpected place for this in the capital of Spain.
There, next to the main arena for conducting the corridor of Pla<0xC3><0xA7>a de Toros de Las Ventas, the most famous Spanish matadors established a monument to the man whose efforts were saved, in their opinion, the lives of hundreds of outstanding masters of the corridor.
By the way, this, in my opinion, a very interesting porcelain work was found by me there, in Madrid, but at other times not at all in this regard.

Although rumors of their wedding were still going in April, the couple officially concluded only now – September 29.
According to People magazine, a private ceremony was held at the Paltrow House on Long Island.

According to Business Insider, payments will grow to $12 billion next year.

Trump Talks About ‘Love’ in Kim Jong Un
From the mutual cruelty of the leaders of the United States and the DPRK, it was almost impossible to fall in love with each other, joked Donald Trump.
U.S. President Donald Trump made a good joke about his successes on the front lines of resolving the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, now the leaders of the two countries have so corrected relations that they are hardly in love with each other, the US president noted.
The owner of the White House recalled that he accepted from the previous administration the North Korean problem as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama’s team has been so engaged in relations with the DPRK that it couldn’t even reach out to the country’s leadership – they simply didn’t take the tube off.
The U.S. and the DPRK were on the brink of war then, and today the North Korean leader is writing “beautiful letters” to the White House, Trump said.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work there was also “gross” to Kim Jong Un, which, however, was mutual.
However, now their relationship has rectified to such an extent that the leaders are “in love with each other.”
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the U.S. media interpreted them as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to the fact that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests, as well as shutting down military police stations.
All of this is the merit of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump stepped down on Kim Jong Un from the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) tribunal.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps he had taken to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK will remain until the Korean peninsula is fully denuclearized.
Negotiations in Singapore
On June 12, Singapore hosted the first U.S.-North Korean talks in history.

As a result of the negotiations, the parties expressed their intention to move towards a peaceful resolution of the disputes, although they did not take on any legal obligations.
The positive results of the meeting were the cessation of nuclear and missile tests of the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps on the way to denuclearization of North Korea are still being taken.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the U.S. had already sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them “gangsters.”

Nietzsche urged to push “Moscow language with Ukrainian product”
Ukrainian children’s writer and native language purity fighter Larisa Nitsoy called for the expulsion of “Russian-language Moscow product and Moscow language” from Ukraine.
To do this, it offers the Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural pressure".
With her thoughts on "the feasibility of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine", Nitsya shared with the Ukrainian edition of "Observer".
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it already exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, the Ukrainians are “wandering” from this “Moscow language”, she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, in the past, Russian speech was widely used on television and radio, but in the public space, it almost did not remain.
At the same time, in Niza’s opinion, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only “extending the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
Earlier, Nizay shared the experience of maintaining the "Ukrainian-speaking regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened to sue a network of Watsons bookstores, the cashier of which spoke to her in Russian.
When she failed to do so, Nietzsche turned her back on the girl.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians calls it "language schizophrenia", calling on Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the writing of names.
Nietzsche recently said that the name “Russia” was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The anger of the writer failed to escape even the Security Service of Ukraine: coming there and hearing the conversations of the employees with each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left, knocking on the door.
In the break they held a man's conversation, and it brought its fruit
Ural defender Denis Kulakov - about the victory over Arsenal (2:1) in the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship.
"Dennis, what do you think you've managed to win?"
“I think we wanted to win more,” said the official website of Urals.
“Such a difficult game happened, in the break they had a serious male conversation, and it brought its fruit: they hit two balls and did not miss.
"You missed a couple of matches because of the damage you got at the beginning of the month.
How did you feel today?”
“If you’ve got 90 minutes, that’s fine.
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe at the end of the day, a little bit of power to make sure nothing happens.
And so, the doctor and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev led me to this game, for which they are very grateful!
"What about the atmosphere in the team?"
“It’s no secret to anyone that after winning and recovering is easier, and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white stripe, although at first it was black.
We need to continue in the same spirit and enjoy the fans.”
"You're sorry about the game when you didn't go out on the field?"
“There is such a thing, a little bit bored, because really, an unpleasant situation came out.
But again, thank you to the physiotherapist and the doctors for putting them on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and delighted the fans.
The rest is secondary.”

In a referendum in Macedonia, violations were recorded.
Four incidents related to violations of electoral legislation were registered in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on renaming.
This was reported on Sunday by the press secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Tony Angelovsky.
Since the opening of polling stations, four incidents have been recorded, which have been eliminated, he said.

“The Ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can peacefully exercise the constitutional right to freely express their will.
We call on citizens to comply with the laws and refrain from any violations of public order and tranquility and any violation of the secret of voting," the spokesman said.
During the referendum on Sunday, citizens are asked to answer one question: “Do you support membership in the EU and NATO by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?”
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
On June 17, during a solemn ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, which crosses the border between the two countries, the heads of the Foreign Ministry of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official designation of the former Yugoslav Republic.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of North Macedonia".
The treaty must resolve not only a long-standing dispute over the name of the country, but also open the way for Skopje to NATO and the EU.

This view was expressed by the head of the Syrian Foreign Ministry, Walid Muallem, in an interview with RT, which aired on Sunday.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia in a negative key was almost absent
The head of the Committee of the Federation Council on International Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not rule out that it can become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric, which we have almost become accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia, has now been more subdued," the senator said in an interview published on Sunday.
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation was occasionally "designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with the Ebola outbreak, along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this line, in any case, in the exposition of the Western countries, it was in the same way.
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, “Russia’s topic in the negative key was practically absent.”
"If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the people were not completely accurate," the politician noted, noting that Russia "was no longer confused by the noise.
The head of the profile committee of the Federation does not rule out that this indicates some trend, which, in his opinion, "will allocate the current session [of the United Nations General Assembly], although in full this trend may manifest itself in a year, in two, three."
"I do not rule out that the current session in some sense can be a turning point," Kosachev said, explaining that "too many examples of how Russia is able to move forward in international affairs with the connection."
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
“So far, unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time,” he added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there appears “a adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not only possible – an integral participant in solving the global problems of modernity”.
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we're going somewhere where the movement will no longer be a movement back, it will be a movement forward," he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context, Kosachev called “a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
"I was present at many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if another year or five years ago I did not speak Russian, I was speaking Russian, I was speaking Russian.
According to him, this is due to the fact that "in the so-called new liberal order, which personifies with the West, there are no answers to the questions of how to solve the world problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas about how to solve the problem of
"And here the demand for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev said, stressing that he believes in this sense "the current session is good for the work of the Russian delegation, good for Russia".

Damascus declares its right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that the Syrian province of Idlib will not have to use military force, the foreign minister of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Muallem, said.

On 17 September, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to establish a demilitarized zone along the lines of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib by 15 October.

Wahtang Kikabidze on the fight against cancer
Now many artists are talking about how they managed to cope with oncology.
The disease, unfortunately, does not spare anyone, and the history of popular people about the victories over cancer gives hope to many patients.
The famous actor Vahtang Kikabidze confessed that he lived only because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis that sounded like a sentence.
“It was like a hammer hit me from the bottom of the skull.
I fell.
He lost his orientation.
Put him in the hospital.
He could not hold the spoon there, could not stand, fell all the time.
They started to do tests, turned out to be bad, the artery does not miss blood.
They brought me to Moscow, where they said that I had a large purulent cyst in my head, they had an urgent operation.
And during the operation, the doctors for the cyst saw the tumor," Kikabidze told the program "Once".
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the inhabitants of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the kumir at the threshold of his house.
But the actor's wife did not allow to bury the actor alive, she believed she could cope with the disease and did not leave her beloved husband's bed for more than a year.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Whenever I had a critical situation, she was next to me like a rock,” the actor admitted.

It should be noted that before Siyyarto in the "Cleansing", the deputy of the Kiev-Pecher Lavra Pavel and the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs) Onufry were pleased.
The reason was their opposition to the acquisition of Tomos by the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Transcarpathia, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for Ukraine’s sovereign rights.

AdG became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" beats another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings fall.
Apparently, the people of Germany began to get seriously tired of Angela Merkel’s immigration policy, which made the country a key target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The most obvious is the recent social questions, according to which the anti-immigrant party "Alternative for Germany" is becoming more and more popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, ADG broke another record, rising to second place in the ranking of popular sympathies.
Right-wing conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to bypass social democrats, with about 16 percent.
The gap in one percentage point can be attributed to a statistical error, but it is worth noting the fact that the ADG created in 2013 from a small group of Eurosceptic economists has managed to turn into a serious political force.
The overall leadership is still holding the HSS/HDS ruling bloc, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points – backing of Angela Merkel’s bloc was four percentage points higher in April.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also reduced.
Today, 48 per cent of Germans support Merkel, which is 7 per cent lower than last year.
Let’s add that the social democrats were followed by the “green” (15%), the left (11%) and the liberals (10%).
Evolution of "Alternatives"
The Alternative for Germany party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the group Alternative Choice 2013 which included the supporters of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government’s course, but initially engaged only in economic issues, including the problems of the euro and interaction within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany’s “sponsoring” of weak EU economies, did not rule out the possibility of returning to the German brand and the country’s full exit from the European Union.
Against the background of the deepening of the immigration crisis, the political platform of the ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party, which took up a niche of Eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, ADG managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of “Alternatives for Germany” received seats in the European Parliament.
Video published with a journalist, who called the citizens of Ukraine "the nation of bolvans"
Leading political talk show on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books Ostap Drozdov on live air admitted that he considers his compatriots "the nation of the bolvans".
They believe in television and don’t read much.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"Since childhood, we are not instilled in the culture of reading and accepting texts," the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately put Drozdov’s words to criticism, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting of the Independent began to struggle with literature, which has the slightest hints of criticism of the Kiev authorities, prohibiting the import of up to 201 edition.

Canadians created a car in case of apocalypse - magazine Behind the wheel
Anyone who wants to buy this car can buy it.
Roshel Defence Solutions said it is already accepting applications for its new armored vehicle.
Roshel Senator APC Apocalyptic Bronze
On the topic of the apocalypse, money is made not only by producers of video games, film studios and book publishing.
Now a new niche for itself is also mastered by automotive companies.
So, Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions introduced its armored apocalypse Senator APC.
In fantasy-free time, the engineers of this company create armored vehicles for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who are without special comfort, but in complete safety are placed in a full-fledged armored capsule.
This bunker, or else the structure will not be named, since its level of booking conforms to the standard B7, is installed on the chassis of the powerful Ford Super Duty pickup.
Its bottom, also armored, is able to protect the capsule from debris by grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Roshel Senator APC Armoured Apocalyptic Salon
In order not to damage the passengers even an explosive wave from the broken down next to the car of the shell, the car's salon is equipped with special damping chairs.

There are no weapons in the car.
Front part of the armored saloon of the Roshel Senator APC
In order not to affect the weight of the armored car, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-strong turbodiesel engine with a volume of 6.7 liters, all the power of which is transferred to the four wheels of the armored vehicle through a 6-speed automatic gearbox.
Chances to get stuck completely in the armored apocalypse Roshel Senator APC no
The Roshel Senator APC armored vehicle can be seen at a specialized exhibition in Washington, D.C., which will be held in October.
Named the time of the universe's death
The universe is about 140 billion years old, which is ten times the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The study of the international team of scientists is presented in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is aimed at publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts have come to such conclusions by observing with the help of the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) Subaru telescope for about ten million galaxies.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 percent of the mass energy of the observed world, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model <0xCE><0x9B>CDM (<0xCE><0x9B> Cold Dark Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the Universe, which was a little slower than previously thought.
The Subaru Observatory’s press release noted that observations made it possible to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the inclusion of data from the European Space Telescope Planck clarified the limitations imposed on the LCDM parameters.
In July, scientists modeled the possible demise of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments in favor of the fact that the observed world would cease to exist 22 billion years later as a result of the Big Bang.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed.
The possibility of knowing the opinion of the people on pension reform is postponed for an indefinite period
In Moscow on Saturday, a meeting of the general federal initiative group of the referendum against increasing the retirement age was held.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups who registered different wordings of the issues (five wordings were registered by the Central Committee in total).
They decided to apply to the CEC with an application for registration of a single initiative group and to ask the Russians the question: “Do you think that the legislation on pension insurance as of July 1, 2018, the age at which the citizens of Russia do not get the right to an appointment?”
This formulation was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered to be the simplest and legal term.
The majority of the participants of the meeting were supporters of member "Just Russia" Ilya Sviridova (six subgroups) and KPRF (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Lower Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Sviridov previously told Vedomosti that invitations had been sent to all initiators, and the consent to come was expressed by representatives of about 40 subgroups.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, the leader of the Vologda sub-group (its formulation was supported by another 15 sub-groups), told Vedomostos that she did not receive the invitation and did not plan to come: “We did not understand who was a friend, but who was an enemy”.

"Admiral" has created big problems for us
Zinetula Bilyaletdinov: "Admiral" has created big problems for us
The head coach of Ak Barsa Zinetula Bilyaletdinov summed up the results of the match of the regular championship of the KHL against the Admiral (4:2).
“It was a difficult game, a difficult one.
The opponent fought with dignity, created great problems for us.
I’m glad we played well in most of them today.
I've already said that someday the goals will come, the main thing is that we work on it.
The fact that we won is also very important.”
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaripov a break in this series?"
“We have a program he’s working on.
Therefore, there was such a decision,” Bilyaletdinov told the press service of the club.
Elon Musk to step down as CEO of Tesla

In the match "Loko" - "Ahmat" the mistakes of Turbina collapsed like from the horn of plenty
Former All-Union Judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Evgeny Turbina in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship "Locomotive" - "Ahmat" and solved the disputed episodes of the game.
- How do you rate the trial of Evgenia Turbina in the match "Locomotive" - "Ahmat"?
"I believe that this referee has confirmed his inadequacy of the Russian Premier League matches.
I am surprised that the efforts in the meeting of the fifth round "Spartak" - "Dynamo", neither Turbine himself nor the leaders of the DSI have made serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private omissions of rough receptions poured out like a horn of plenty.
For example, in the 50th minute, the railroadman Edera stumbles with his hands in his penalty area defender "Ahmat" Rodolfo.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put penalties.
- How do you rate the episode involving Idow, who was in the 82nd minute when it seemed that the ball hit him?
- I think there was a deliberate play by the defender's hand in my penalty area.
Turbin was close to the moment, he sees this episode well and his first assistant on the right.
This moment was also to be seen by the reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all three were asleep, and the penalties were not imposed.
Therefore, the account in the match is distorted, and the sports justice turned out to be dirty.
This was the same case when the concept of justice pushed and buried the sporty spirit of the game.
In the 52nd minute, Turbin did not decide to remove the guest defender Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight with Kryhovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he gave him a demonstration.
What do you think of this episode?
Did I have to show you the second strawberry?
- At this point Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite in the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of justice that some teams are penalized for such violations as in the episode with Idov, and some are not.
What do you think of the footballer’s words?
- I see what you mean by double standards.
There were penalties.
They didn't give it to him.
So, the referee does not give a second penalty to the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge is watching who is playing.
He played Lokomotiv on Saturday and Ahmata has serious claims to Turbin’s work because the team was damaged.
Matt Damon Plays Accused of Rape by Judge Kavanaugh at SNL Start
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate in the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Cavano, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
In the course of a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh in court in the Senate on charges of rape.
A candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court has previously drawn attention to his emotionality and detailing his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Clobushar.
Thus, Kavanaugh repeatedly confessed in his love for beer, but stated that he had never drunk to memorylessness.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kavanaugh stated that he was a virgin at the time.
These moments also defeated Damon.
I was just doing a lot of drinking and not thinking about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunk virgin I've ever seen.
Everyone knows this," the judge said in a statement to Matt Damon.
Previously, Kavanaugh was elected Supreme Court Justice of the United States.
Barbara Streisand has discovered a strange behavior in her cloned dogs.
American singer Barbra Streisand said the clones of her dead dog behave quite differently than the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it’s impossible to clone the soul,” the 76-year-old singer said.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog, a cotton-de-tulaire breed named Samantha, which had to be put to sleep due to health problems.

U.S. Considers Russia’s Sea Blockade Due to Oil and Gas Supply
In the U.S., they could launch a naval blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the global energy carrier market.
The U.S. authorities have fought so fiercely for the success of the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to Russia’s maritime blockade, which remains one of the world’s leading energy suppliers.
About the possibility of a sea blockade the day before, U.S. Minister of State Ryan Zinke said.
Contrary to global practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior does not perform police, but civilian functions, including implementing policies in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke’s statement was fully within the competence of the department headed by him, although the political color was not deprived.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to U.S. naval forces they control sea lanes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
Zinke said the need could be linked to Washington’s desire to prevent Russian supplies to the global energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives a lion’s share of its revenues from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow’s activation in this region, Zinke believes.
The minister made it clear that the United States still expects to secure leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
For this, Washington will have to push Russia and Iran, and the sea blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke said.

In Russia there is a club that I follow.
Former captain of Chelsea and England team John Terry - about why he visited the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship "Spartak" - "Rostov" (0:1).
“In Russia, I have a club that I follow.
I’ve been watching it quite recently and I was interested in looking at it from the side.
I can’t say that I’m a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartacus and I want to apologize again for the decision I made,” says Terry on the Chelsea fan site.
Recall, "Rostov" with 18 points rose to third place in the tournament table, and "Spartak" placed on the fifth line, having 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, the red and white on October 7 will play with Enise, and the subordinates Valeria Karpina will take Orenburg the day before.
An expensive violin was given to the Lombard for a priceless price
When in the city of Somerville (Massachusetts) a lombard LBC Boutique and Loan man brought a violin, for an old and unpresentable instrument, the lombard worker offered only $50.
But an experienced store manager, Dylan McDermitt, suspected it was an ancient and expensive tool, and turned to the expert for advice.
It turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Galliano and is estimated at $250,000.
The only clues to the violin are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin was not so long ago stolen from one of the city's residents, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the person who gave it to the Lombard, but there are no previous clashes with the law behind it.
The manager says that now all those bringing in the lombard violin will be asked to play on it to make sure it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL we are waiting for an exciting confrontation: Spartak will host at his stadium in Tushin "Rostov" under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a person, as we know, not a foreign "people's team".
The special pique of this meeting is the fact that clubs now have an equal number of points - 15, and they share 3 and 4 places in the table of the tournament, stepping back from the far-flung "Zenita" and being in one point from "Krasnodar".
In red-and-whites now the strip is not easy: the club is once again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League, the team Massimo Carrera unexpectedly flew "Rapid", and recently gave up the house "Ahmat".
After a derby with CSKA, which ended up being a fair nobody, "Spartak" with a minimum score and not without effort won the Cup "Black Sea", and it is too early to talk about whether the most popular club of Russia is approaching the exit from the crisis.
"Rostov" three matches in a row could not win, but he does not know the defeats of five matches already.
Let’s see if Karpina will be able to extend the undefeated series with such a principled match for himself.
The previous meeting of the Karpin "Rostov" with "Spartak" ended in favor of the capital team.
Starts at 7:00.

London is outraged by the accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the results of the Cold War, UK Defence Minister Gavin Williamson said.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech at a congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
The threat is growing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more and more dangerous, enemies are acting in gray areas with cyber attacks and fake news, the minister added.
But the biggest of them is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Western politicians have repeatedly been refuted by Moscow, TASS reports.

The translator compared the mentality of the Russians and the Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a large role in mutual understanding.
On the International Day of Translators, September 30, the professional translator-synchronist Berbel Saxon spoke about this.
She has been translating from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan events calmly, and the Russians, as the proverb says, "go fast for a long time."
But it seems to me that for the mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of the translator, this does not play a significant role," said a specialist in the RIA Novosti commentary.
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries do not do without each other, “it is enough to know history”.
And in the future, Saxon noted, Germany has no sense of ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are a lot of things that determine our common destiny,” she said.
Earlier in the day, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country was trying to “link” relations with Russia and support them.
According to her, the project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is built from the coast of Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is especially important for Berlin mania.

Valery Belov: God Helped Siberia Today
The head coach of "Vitazhya" Valery Belov - about the defeat of "Siberia" (3:4) in the match of the regular championship of the KHL.
“The colleague spoke about the fans of Siberia, and I want to celebrate our fans,” said Belova’s official website Vytazhya.
“I hope they will support it as well, because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
In the game, God probably helped the Siberians today, because they were very wrong, especially our leaders.
In general, we lost the micro - match 0:3 our leading leaders, so it was difficult for us to withdraw this match, although there were moments.
However, I will still take the blame for myself.
Because, apparently, we've missed what's in the pipeline.

Audiences outraged by Agutina's choice for "Voice" show
The audience of the show "Voice 60+" accuses the teacher Leonid Agutin of "impossible cumulation and subtle subtraction".
When in blind auditions he learned from the first notes the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin, many hoped that he would maintain neutrality and not return to the performer.
But the son's feelings took over, and he chose a relative on his team.
At the time, many thought it was a joke, but forgave the instructor for being unbiased in the first stage.
But the "chuckle" was delayed, and the father of the star took the place of more worthy performers absolutely unjustified.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutina such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience of the show, were outraged by the rude and frank chattering of our close relatives on the final staircase.
I had already doubted that Agutina had enough strength and conscience not to push her dad to the first place until the end,” Irina Petrovskaya and Xenia Larina discussed in the program “The Man from the TV”.
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father Leonid Agutin "float" the beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining what the audience still wants to see in his father's show.
But, as it turned out, this is not the case, the audience wants to objectively evaluate and see really talented performers in the final, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
“I feel sorry for the Voice participants from Agutin’s team – they were convicted.”
“Last time, Agutin showed how much he loved Dad, and today he had to show himself as a professional.”
“The competition has lost its meaning.”
“To remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project of your dad who will not sing but whisper, how can you then call a mentor?”
“He likes the Pope, organize a concert in the Kremlin for his money and see how many people come to this concert.”
It's the Voice show, not the Pretty Relatives show.
“From Agutin’s side it was unprofessional.”
"Then you have to offer to perform on your own show, not on the show, which is done for the money of Channel 1."
“It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone’s place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did the working man from Surgut merge with a magnificent voice and darkness, and Pope Augustine led to the final?
And then we all complain that on stage and from screens the same faces for decades!
That’s because they don’t break through the cracks!”
"What were you waiting for?
This is Russia!
Round mud and coumadin.
And the money in the family budget will not be extra!
“The theatre is going on!”
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice", the son of Gradsky appeared on the blind auditions.
Then the meter and the head did not come to take the son to his own team.
What's more, he said, "Come on, get out of here, everything's clear."
Agutin was not able to act as a professional.

The head of the Institute of Space Research of the RAN, corresponding member of the RAN Anatoly Petrukovich told RIA Novosti about a possible program of scientific research for Russian astronauts on the Moon.
According to him, the scientific community is now developing directions for such works.

Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), called the "early tooth" of the manager of the 7-Eleven 24-hour network store: in May, he put him out of the store for inappropriate behavior.

If Glushakov and Eshchenko are playing likes, that doesn’t mean they have something against the coach.
I think Italians lack the flexibility to perceive the situation.
And it doesn't serve the normal climate of the team.
Today Spartak has no game, so this situation did not need to be blown up at all.
Maybe it was worth laughing at this together.
Spartak has a lot of not in order in different lines, there is no playability after the introduction to the youth.
The relations within the team, it seems, do not add optimism before this match," Tarpishchev said.
The game of the two teams will take place on September 30 and will begin at 19.00 Moscow time.
Former Spartacus rebuffer John Terry led the Chelsea youth team.
The students of Sirius discussed with scientists natural-like technologies
The pupils of the educational center "Sirius" in Sochi, participants of the School of agrobiology and plant genetics, visited a lecture of scientists of the national research center "Kurchatovsky Institute".
The presentation of the researchers took place within the framework of the program of the Global International Forum of Convergence and Nature-like Technologies, organized in Sochi on the order of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, according to the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary film "Koda Kurchatov", during which the president of the Kurchatov Institute, corresponding member of the RAN Mikhail Kovalchuk told about the global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The lecture of the scientist is published on the website "Sirius".
Teachers have learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to produce such volumes.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, will help the natural-like technologies that young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the issue of responsibility for the development of natural technologies, as well as told about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
“The advent of such technologies is a unique thing, it’s a tremendous good.
This is the explosive growth of medical technologies, it is the improvement of quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is also the other side.
The development of nature-like technologies is, in fact, a technological reproduction of systems of living nature.
There is a reverse side - a targeted intervention in a person's life activities.
There are always risks.
There was a car, and people were dying under the wheels.
The cars are still in use.
The dual nature of technology immediately.
I am creating medical new technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction," REN TV quoted the scientist as saying.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
In the role of the speakers were the candidate of physical and mathematical sciences, the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-nature-like technologies of NIC "Kurchatov Institute" Yulia Dyakov and the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-technology Vyacheslav Demin.
The Sirius Educational Center in Sochi was established by the Talent and Success Educational Foundation on the basis of Olympic infrastructure on the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the educational center is the early identification, development and further professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the all-Russian online information security Olympiad "Kybervyzov" will be sent to study in "Sirius".
A life-saving air traffic controller saved a plane with passengers during an earthquake in Indonesia
In Indonesia, they said goodbye to air traffic controller Antonius Gunawan Agung, who at the cost of his life saved hundreds of passengers of Batik Air.
On 28 September, he worked at Palu's Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Sulawesi Island.
At the time of a strong earthquake, an airliner was preparing for the take-off.
Agung refused to leave the command-and-control altitude and helped the plane get up in the air.
When the magnetic field of the oscillation reached 7.4, the tower began to collapse.
The 21-year-old inspector had to jump from the height of four floors.
When he fell, he was seriously injured by internal organs, and doctors were unable to save him.
Russian submarine "Kazan" scared the United States
The biggest danger for the U.S. Navy is the Russian submarine “Kazan”.
This was stated by American counter-admiral Dave Johnson, relaying "Rosbalt" with reference to The National Interest.
“We are threatened by a serious potential enemy.
It is enough just to look at "Severodvinsk", - he said, pointing to the predecessor model "Kasani".

Macedonia: referendum did not take place due to low turnout
The referendum was intended to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje on the renaming of the Balkan country to "North Macedonia".
Greece objected to the use by the Macedonians of the name of its historic province.
The renaming angered the former Yugoslav Republic of the opening of the path in NATO and later in the EU.
But, according to the EFE, only 34% of Sunday plebiscite appearances “did not reach” the constitutional threshold by 50%.
However, since the referendum was only consultative in nature, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to give up the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the closure of the polling stations, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a supporter of changing the name of the republic, said that if there were more "yes" among the votes cast, Macedonia would change the name despite the unreached quorum.

Kemerovchan outraged a herd of rams at the cemetery
On September 30, on the well-known Kemerovskaya page on the social network came a message from an eyewitness that horned animals roam freely on one of the local cemeteries.
The animals of a large herd passed between the fences and dug out the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: some of the locals noted that in the presence of a small cattle, there is no harm, and their appetite can even help to clear the territory from weeds and grasshoppers, but not to feed some of the villagers.
"It's a cemetery, not a cemetery.
There's nothing for the bartenders to do there.
Of course, you won’t say about the bars that they cost money, but that’s not the case.” (style preserved) – said the angry Kemerovchanka in her message.
Either way, some of the witnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and soon the necessary measures will be taken.
Pushing and pushing – how is it right?
There are no words to pressure.
It's right to comply.
The word "pressure" in the sense of "pushing, influencing, influencing" exists only phonetically because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "please".
We use this word, assuming that it comes from the word “pressure.”
But "pressure" and "satisfaction" etymologically not only are not close, but even in some sense the opposite.
Be sure to do it yourself.
Longing (church-book, obsolete) means "enough, full, enough, to be enough for anyone or anything, to satisfy."
To be content, pleasure is a relative word.
Previously, he had the meaning of “not to depend on anything, to have self-satisfying meaning” – “to please yourself”.
Staroslavian "dovl<0xC5><0xA1>ti" is related to the words "to command" and "will".
Pushing, pushing, and pushing are completely different.
In these words, truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (draughting sheep), deyja - "die" and dvaid<0xC4><0xAB> - "trouble".
A similar phonetic form of the words "pressure" and "satisfaction", as well as the inevitable aging of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
Thus, we have come up with the very "d" which is also used in writing through "a", which is, better, incorrect and impossible from the point of view of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
So, it's right to be satisfied.
But this word is obsolete, in its proper sense no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative effect on you from above, use the word “press”.
You can also use the "pressure" structure, but remember that it is a cankerite.

With the help of the operation in Syria, Russia has protected itself from terrorists
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 were destroyed by the Russian Air and Space Forces.
This was told in connection with the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former head of the VKS, the head of the Committee of the Federation Council on Defense and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air strikes: Air and space forces have and continue to carry out all strikes precisely on terrorist objects.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed in Syria over the past three years - they are, for example, warehouses of ammunition, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the defense of the jihadists was violated - this has become a decisive contribution to the promotion of the government forces of Syria, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to shield Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IS) and Jebhat-an-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the side of the IS there were about four thousand fighters from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries, TASS reports.
And it is only about the registered persons, not counting those who have not been identified, said Bondarev.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on distant borders - otherwise this evil would "swipe at us".
Boris Johnson’s telephones and a number of British ministers have been made available to the public.

According to the TV channel, several politicians received "unpleasant calls".
The technical problem is solved, now the use of the app is safe.
We study the causes of the failure and apologize for any problems caused," the Conservative Party said.
During the crash, users could not only see confidential data, but also edit information in the profiles of politicians and journalists.
For example, in the profile of the Minister of Environment, Ecology and Agriculture Michael Gouva replaced his photo with a photo of media magnate Rupert Merdoch.
Syria accuses the U.S. of supporting terrorism
The head of the Syrian Foreign Ministry, Walid Muallem, has accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and supporting terrorism.
[Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it destroyed the infrastructure and public services in the areas against which its actions were directed, it committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
“These murders under international law are war crimes,” he said.
According to Muallem, the U.S. and its partners provided “direct support to terrorists” as the goals of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and meant “a sowing of chaos, death and destruction on their way.”
The head of the foreign ministry also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost over, and the country has become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria of illegal foreign presence, and priority in restoring the country will be given to Syrian partners.

It included Valentin Konovalov (KPRF) and the acting head of the Republic Viktor Zimin ("United Russia").
However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
In the upcoming tour together with Konovalov should take part Andrei Filagin (“Just Russia”).
The Khakasian media suggests that Putin can accept the resignation of the head of Khakasiya and appoint a new head of the republic, as well as make a decision about the fate of Zimin.
Putin visited Khakasiya in January of this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president’s favorite places to rest.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict, which has been going on in Syria for seven years.
About five million people fled to other countries, primarily to neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, in Damascus’s view, military action is nearing completion, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said: “The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure thanks to the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues to rehabilitate in areas destroyed by terrorists, bringing them back to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that made life more difficult for people and deprived them of their livelihoods.
The Syrian authorities have also called on the world community to promote the return of refugees and allocate funds for this.
Meanwhile, the U.S. and EU countries are refusing to provide assistance to Syria, saying that a political solution to the conflict must first be found.
Volksvagen fully acknowledged its guilt in the Dieselgate in January 2017.
In December of last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the managers of the American unit of the company, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
The Group’s losses are estimated at least 25 billion euros.
This amount includes not only fines and compensation.
By June of next year, the automaker is obliged to buy or repair 85% of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the company’s management said that the commitments have already been fulfilled for 83% of cars, so the program will be completed early.
Volksvagen is trying to compensate for the losses and restore the trust of its customers.
Thus, the management of the Group has recently changed again, and it has also been announced about large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system.
What’s more, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesels on its streets: such a right was granted by the authorities in February of this year.

Metropolitan Ilarion compared Kiev’s decision to rename UOC with actions of fascists
The head of the Synodal Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church Metropolitan Ilarion compared the name of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
“It is still the case that in fascist Germany, Jews should be given a yellow star, that is to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created,” the Metropolitan said on the TV channel “Russia-24” (quote).
According to him, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is at an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and “put it out of the law,” the priest believes.
"This is the Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country," he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter implies the renaming of the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
Deputy of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
Metropolitan Vladimir, Deputy of the Holy Assumption Lavra of Pochaev, spoke with a call to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian saints.
The text of his address to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the website of the resident.
At different times in the history of our predecessors and relatives in the faith and spirit, Christians had to confess their faith and defend their sanctuaries.
Given the situation that has occurred, both on the information we have and on the threats of the massacres that are spreading, it is clear that we will also have to survive,” the Metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
The Lavra’s deputy also stressed that “it is likely that your physical presence will be needed.”
The priest added: “Lenin’s grandsons are in the spirit, they are threatened with destruction, and therefore we will protect our sanctuary.”
Who is not indifferent to the fate of the Pochaev Lavra - the Orthodox Ukrainian and World Shrine, should be ready to protect it, the petition says.
The Metropolitan urged not to go on trial with those who mislead the believers.
The UOC has a canonical status as defined by Thomas of 29 October 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to introduce depending on the new-style patriarch and a friend of the Roman Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
The new style, with its consequences, is unacceptable to us by the Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has,” the Lavra’s deputy said.
He recalled that the UOC has been canonically independent and completely independent in its administration since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, Thomas already has our church.
What else do we need Tomos?" said Metropolitan Pochaevsky Vladimir, calling on believers and all citizens to ask whether there are other Tomos denominations, whether they are independent from the Vatican?
The believers understood to some extent and determined which temple they should go to.
However, some people want to sow hostility and discord again.
Some people are jealous that domes are shining on the temples they want to destroy,” the priest said.
The Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
Lavra is located on the top of Pochaevska Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical records of it date back to the beginning of the 13th century.

If we continue to play well, the wins will come.
The head coach of Moscow "Dynamo" Vladimir Vorobiev - about the defeat of the "Automobilist" (0:1) in the match of the regular championship of the KHL.
"The good game was interesting, although it went to the goal" - says Vorobyev's official website "Automobilista".
“We tried to play very easy.
I really liked the first period.
I didn’t use a few good moments.
In the second period, the opponent bit us, we stood up.
But removing us was a little "fed up."
The guys played great, they did the coaching set.
I think if we continue to play well, the victories will come.
Don’t bet, with zero heads the game doesn’t win, but the content of the game itself was correct.
Good luck if we continue to play in that direction.”
"In your opinion, did the "Automobilist" add up compared to the meetings in Lower Novgorod?"
“We didn’t play in a foreign league.
In the preseason, the team solved other tasks, many young guys played.
I think there was a completely different game, a different hockey.
The "car driver" is a good good team.
From the tournament table, it is clear that the team is playing correctly.
Good hockey, a good atmosphere both in the arena and in the city.
You can only wish them luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
A lot of good players, there are leaders.
A good defense, a good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were getting ready.
They knew the team was going unbeaten, they wanted to break it, but it didn’t work out.”

U.S. Plans to Increase Opiate Production in Afghanistan
Much has been said about the sharp worsening of the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, in the Afghan territory, the militants launched a real terrorist war against the organs of state power and the peaceful population of the country.
This year has become a record number of blood attacks, as a result of which thousands of simple Afghans have died," - said Patrushev.
The troubles of Afghanistan began not far away yesterday.
After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group Al-Qaeda (prohibited in the Russian Federation), which invaded Afghanistan.
Not a month has passed since the United States and its NATO allies launched the “Indestructible Freedom” military operation there.
It's been 17 years.
There are thousands of U.S. troops still in Afghanistan.
And the peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
U.S. troops are being driven out for the closure of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they are ransomed from the militants for money - they just wouldn't touch them.
The government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - in the Taliban movement (forbidden in Russia).
Another 10% - for ISIS terrorists (forbidden in the Russian Federation).
But they grow there quickly.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia – exactly what they failed to achieve in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be in a good mood.
In the course of 17 years of American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
The colossal growth of areas affected by opium poppy and multibillion-dollar profits.
The Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO on the condition that the country’s name is changed.
The agreement on the renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on June 17 as a result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbor the right to be called Macedonia, observing the same name in the same name.
Lupko Petkovsky, political scientist: “With this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia gets the right to a better future, the hope for social change.
And Greece will secure the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises that can’t satisfy absolutely everyone.”
The country is renamed by the ruling Social Democrats headed by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
The opposition is the conservative opposition and the president of the country George Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government headed by Zaev is forced from abroad to change the name.
However, this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
It is clear that there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
Faye Dulgeri, Euronews: “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole.”
