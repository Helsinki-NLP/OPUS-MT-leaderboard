All over the world, Google and Facebook are planning to create a brand new Internet with a strong focus on social media.
A global thinker, computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee has launched a campaign against Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The original code of Berners-Liz was named Inrupt, a project built on the Solid platform.
He must hold fast to the sure and trustworthy Word of God as he was taught it, so that he may be able both to give stimulating instruction and encouragement in sound (wholesome) doctrine and to refute and convict those who contradict and oppose it [showing the wayward their error].
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company magazine, Berners-Lee wrote: “The maxim of Inrupt is the rule of the whole world.”
“We’re not going to do that now,” he said at the start.
“This is the story.”
Solid technology is used in the device to make people "personal online information" of their concepts.
And he gave some who (are) apostles, and some who (are) prophets, and some who (are) evangelists, and some who (are) pastors, and some who (are) doctors;
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are ideal for a single browser and all-in-one browsing experience.
It is necessary to stop their talk, because they are upsetting whole families by teaching what they should not, and all for the shameful purpose of making money.
The company is known as "Personal Possibilities" in the media.
When Inrupt, the company's general manager, John Bruce, said: "The idea is that everyone who is a solid has the resources, processes, and penalties to make sure that everyone is successful."
At the moment, the company consists of Berner-Lee, Bruce, IBM's platform of innovation, some state-of-the-art thinkers and free programs that have been hired to work on the project.
Everyone on earth will worship the beast, if they do not have their names in the book of life. The book of life belongs to the Lamb who was killed. That was Gods plan since the world was made.
In the words of Berners-Lee, he and his team, Facebook and Google, will not hesitate to work with Facebook and Google on the whole business model.
“We don’t want to give them permission.”
On the same day, Berners-Lee wrote on the Medium portal: “The mission of Inrupt is to build a solid foundation of commercial energy and ecosystem, and to build a solid foundation and a solid foundation.”
In 1994, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology established the foundation of the Worldwide Internet Sales Consortium, the Internet of Things.
In the early years of his career, he played a key role in the development of the Berners-Lee Neighbourhood.
In the case of Inrupt, Berners-Lee became the founder and director of the Asian Institute of Public Affairs, the World Internet Sales Consortium, and the non-profit-making Web Foundation.
“I’m optimistic about the future of the Internet,” Berners-Lee said in a statement.
