Austria’s right-wing populists have won 29 percent of the vote.
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current major coalition, as well as a notable strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), where the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffers particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the governor of Carinthia J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remain, with 29.8 percent of the vote, the country's first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the vote.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP, which with 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of the vote, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the popular party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Again in early July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable advance on the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
However, voters were visibly punished for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations about the possible resignation of the party leader and current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were made.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday, at the extraordinary council of party leadership.
Such an evolution would a priori facilitate the way to the outcome of the election that remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the large SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP coalition.
Nevertheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free (FP<0xC3><0x96>) would have obtained 18 percent and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> eleven percent of the votes - the Socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a 1999 party, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at the time, the CP<0xC3><0x96> was still
Haider, who has already stated that he was ready to work with any party and that he was planning to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently put on this evolution.
The last party to have access to parliament is the Greens, but these have slightly lost and fell back, among the Austrian political parties, from third to fifth position.
Obviously, no other party exceeds the limit of four per cent and does not have access to parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are likely to cool down
If the problem could not be solved with regard to the Czech researchers accused, in India, accused of the illegal collection of cockroaches, it would follow, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
The minister declared it today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he noted after the meeting, carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the talks, that the executive power could hardly intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was dismissed from the charge and punished by a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of the Darjeling, the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the latter.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
As a result, he could seek bail and wait for the trial to be released, he said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way also during the talks.
“He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned,” says the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
He also said that such aid had already been provided to them by India.
“We want above all to maintain the best relations with India, which have a tradition going on for many years.
The Indians recognize it as well," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he stressed in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We consider the incarceration and prosecution of these Czech researchers as a great contempt," he said.
The Minister evaded the question whether he had obtained from India the promise to take care of the case.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he only noted.
A Czech referees the fight for the bottom of the sea
It approaches a walled electronic map, on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are represented.
Now, he is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
This area is still as large as the continent itself,” said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of the thirty members of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its chief, director of the division, Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, follows the presentation and the complete from time to time.
Firefighters at work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little-known world so far, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found there, but also living organisms currently unknown, which may contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A wider background than the firm earth
Today, coastal states have begun to eagerly aspire to the new underwater territories.
According to a UN convention, they do use their rights, which they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the Convention, claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental shelf.
To simplify, it is considered as a continental shelf the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the boundaries of the littoral sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the said exclusive economic ion,” Mikulka explains.
The request made by the country in question to the Commission for the establishment of the outer borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a wide range of scientific and technical documentation, based on many expensive prospectings and metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
“One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the Commission has dealt with five applications, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand, to date.
At the moment, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," Mikulka adds.
Australia’s success, which is the first to have significantly expanded its submarine holdings, has recently experienced a global resounding.
New Zealand, too, has gained from the territory - the extent of the seabed, which the commission assigned to it last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometres, which represents the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The profit they will reap in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they plan, be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, submit their applications.
They can do so within ten years after ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention".
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the zone of the ocean floor, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no longer any state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
“Nevertheless, we are not mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike,” he said, exaggerating Director Mikulka, noting that “its areas are clearly defined and their regime is anchored in a contract.”
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other countries of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other States, it obtained the status of the so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and the Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is moved there, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
“It is possible to extract from it on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a realization.
She recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were in place for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had asked for Germany’s help in resolving the hostage crisis – the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready but never took action.
More and more details about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists abducted in Egypt are revealed.
According to the instructions of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both Federal Army specialists and GSG 9 officials, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as the Technischen Hilfwerk logistics experts, were at the scene of the liberation.
As reported by the Departments' spokesman on Monday evening, German forces were ultimately not required, hostage takers having released their prisoners and having fled when they recognized the imminence of a release by force.
The Egyptian government is said to have accepted the aid provided by Germany to integrate it on the ground as a support force.
“Fortunately, this has not happened so far,” a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers had abducted the group of tourists in southern Egypt consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were smuggled into the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of hostage takers has so far remained vague, as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have meanwhile arrived healthy and save Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
At the moment, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to Bild magazine, the five vacationers and special forces are expected to take off on board an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress failed little the $700 billion heavyweight financial markets bailout plan.
The Dow Jones was crawling into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the bailout plan in favor of the government’s financial markets.
Despite all the calls of U.S. President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was to juggle the chaos of financial markets did not get a majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the well-founded $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called the MPs to a favourable vote although the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to have political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones dropped by more than six percent to 600 points.
The reason for this was investors’ concern that the state bailout plan could capitulate.
It went back shortly before the end of the vote, then, after the announcement of failure, fell again.
Experts are now projecting new serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, approval and the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are required.
Organizers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the next few months, according to a study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year – for the winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the desire for German travel remains insatiable, according to this study.
With regard to reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 percent compared to the same period the previous year, as was reported by the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing numbers of bookings are already dominating the fall months.
Thus, the sales figure would have risen to about 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV said.
The sources of these results are the GfK figures, which analyzes monthly booking data from 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low price of the dollar, travel to the U.S. would be particularly in demand, the DRV said.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
In addition to this, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be destinations particularly wanted by the Germans.
The trips organized in particular are very much in demand, explained the President of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising energy and food prices, the costs here would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with discounts on pre-bookings or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been highly remembered so that an increase in sales figures will be recorded again compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer party
The hits of Ballermann or Abres-Ski continuously, from beer in piquettes to liter and celebrities in Tyrolean costumes to designer.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don’t really have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV animator and wears a custom-cut Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves at us and fill out their memory card - very flattering, and this on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to reach its goal.
As a beer festival tourist and normally living north of the Wei<0xC3><0x9F>wurst Equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once in Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Square, everything is half worse.
Everyone or almost wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; no one looks blared or embarrassed - it's completely normal.
Only the board of my Tyrolean costume collects a few strange eyeballs at the stand of the choc<0xC3><0xB3> bananas.
A Bavarian woman tells me that I would have attached my sign badly: "to the left means free, in the middle of the virgin, to the right broken, to the back of the widow."
Discreetly, I tripped my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she said, laughing.
Others don’t give themselves so much trouble for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which is written “Too drunk to get dressed!” and exposes their naked back train without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and comes for the first time at the beer party.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an elongated "oooooo".
He tells me all of this after he's relieved of the shock he's had before.
Right next to this mouth of fire that everyone believes to be a trash can.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild-slayers".
Others do not have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, rescuers’ ribs run to the party square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Nurses intervene rather in mutton - always by four, they drag their civets covered with tents.
This is how it works for most visitors to the beer party: we go empty there, we return full of it.
Those who rest in the coffin of the owls under the roof are not visible.
“They are the ones who can’t swallow anything anymore,” one of the rescuers yelled at me in response to my question and then disappeared into the mix.
Victim of accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later died.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous conduct.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey is broadening its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to get into their homeland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, 20 steps away from Asia, lies one of the finest relics of his fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed in a neo-renaissance style, by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that’s what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, with observation tower at each of its angles, like some German provincial mayors.
The stones are dirty.
The entire building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we no longer have any doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, late in the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as to the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperialist ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding area, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
. The British and the forces of the empire advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it is a sabotage operation.
Since then, it slowly falls into ruin, engulfed in the meanders of history.
But today, the passage of the railway to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serves to emphasize the expansion of Turkey’s diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding area, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now it is time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a carriage-bed towards the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish MP AKP Su<0xC3><0xA2>t Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a ten-and-a-half hour trip, shaken on noisy rails whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived, in the Turkish capital—presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning my back on its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots is an example of a change in Turkish consensus.
He suspects the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, expressly built of stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and by many pastries in which middle managers in costume-slave-men and women-men-men-women-men-men-women-men-men-women-men-women-women-women-men-women-women-women-women-women-women-women
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
“The purpose of this foreign policy is to now reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she must look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case with each other.
She had to do both.
“But then, at some point, I asked if Turkey should not choose.”
“Turkey,” he said, “does not want to have to choose between the two.”
He then pointed out an aspect that almost all of those with whom I was able to talk, told me by heart: The Turkish railway is not only going to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as it is for Turkey.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another sleepless night, I thought back to these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
As I waited at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been called "the sick of Europe".
At least there is no longer any doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: Music director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already starting his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The chorus was to include the under-21s, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 refused to give up the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any type of music presented to it, whether madrigal or messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod used to tell us to "let music speak for itself."
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
Everything is there, in the music.
So sing!"
His baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, it raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be named a knight, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was conducting the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me—and sometimes they even inspired me.
Tod Handley so rarely held this combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, “only focus on certain people.”
He will be missed by many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
William Woodruff's obituary (died September 25) states that "in 1946, he resumed his studies in economic history, at Oxford, and in 1950, became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD."
That’s what comes from Woodruff’s letter to Beyond Nab End, but that’s not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "The Flamenco and Life" because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention because of the simplicity and strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with a lot of respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second assault on Honda's super sales
In November, Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
In addition to this, some refined mechanics, which increase the comfort of driving and allow to save more fuel.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz features a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before examining the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation is launched.
First of all, it is noted that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time frame than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less well known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more than one million cars sold in six years, ranks second.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it plans to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda’s sales in Spain.
The executives of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely reduce sales in Spain.
Indeed, brand managers hope to end the year with a sales of 22,000 cars, that is 4,000 fewer cars than in 2007, a 16% drop in sales.
With this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to gain a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid with a compact size – 4.37 meters long – on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is planned in the first three months of next year, after its public presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 metres (five centimetres plus), its width 1.69 metres (two centimetres plus) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 metres, which represents an increase of five centimetres.
On the other hand, the height does not change 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and the interior space also.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a gas reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the trunk capacity – which has a double bottom system – can contain up to 399 liters, 19 liters of additional capacity compared to the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the box capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation - in addition to exterior elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof - is the improvement of access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, starting from the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened with a 67 degree angle.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2- and 1.4-litre petrol engines.
Both engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine power.
The first 1.2-liter engine develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This propellant - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous powertrain, which in the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaches 100 horses.
This 100 horse Honda Jazz 1.4L has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The ‘Bee Car’ That Avoids Collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired, this time around, by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers at the Nissan Advanced Technical Center Motor Co. have created this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C represents the development of the Nissan safety shield.
This robot will allow the brand’s vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal oval-shaped space that looks a lot like the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the eyes composed of the bee, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is known as a Laser Range Finder.
The latter detects the obstacles that are located over a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance up to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bifurcating its 90-degree or higher wheels to avoid collision.
The biggest difference compared to any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is entirely instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Moving Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned upwards or downwards or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
" Every second this device should only process information and act according to that data.
It does not need to keep the information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, which is why it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.”
This represents the first car to develop new collision-prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced into the series cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot runs on lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They are afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be recognized that the Treasury of the United States, in addition to having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without genius.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from getting into mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is to say 'The Hotel of Bad Credits'...or stories.
The gloomy appearance of this accommodation and especially of the Hotel Master leads us to think several times if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it.
It is certain that this game gives useful but little detailed information.
It's more of a game for teenagers.
What to do if the game ends?

Morgan Stanley opens its capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry into its round table of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s first bank, which will spend nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new one welcomed by a sharp drop in its stock market price.
A week after unveiling a tentative deal, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9 percent of Morgan Stanley’s common stock at a unit price of $25.25, or a total of $3 billion.
The retained price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall operation would be carried out on the basis of an average unit price of $29, or 28% above its current price.
However, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% to $23.07 around 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said John Mack, the group’s CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but pass it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented Monday also show that the deal has been modified over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares in Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, told Tokyo, "we thought the participation would be entirely made up of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if the latter exchange more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at approximately $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that MUFG’s capital will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to show a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had "clearly" eased his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been arduous for the group, which saw its stock exchange rate melt by half as the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt flew.
This cost was high on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, in part from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Refounding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, was the third to vote on a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results of 80% of the suffrage.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations and a countdown from a non-governmental organization announced a broad “yes” victory, ranging from 63 percent to 70 percent.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday night.
The “Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly,” he said, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the seat of the Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was held calmly according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), focused on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" advocated by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, by reserving to it the "development planning" of a country living essentially on oil extraction by foreign companies and currencies sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants enhanced powers to the head of state, who will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year terms and have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will serve a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provides for the ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the attack against the rapists of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon healthy and safe.
In the morning, they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived around 3:30 p.m. on board a special aircraft at al-Maza military base, which was docked at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, aboard helicopters to the Maadi Hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examination.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been swept from one cache to the other by 35 unknown rescuers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, sent on board two helicopters, had launched the attack on the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of fires occurred, and half of the rioters were killed, the others fleeing," said the official, who requested anonymity.
He said 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "light" unit had been sent to Sudan in total, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where he is located, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
“We have to acknowledge that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in secret services, special forces,” he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board a patrol, killing six people, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group from Darfur, the Sudan-United Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which this movement had immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and is taking place in this election campaign.
All the better.
But one sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the amounts of misery given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving?
What politician dares to remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don’t have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and this, in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoires du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 history, heritage, archives and genealogy societies are concerned with exploring history, preserving with three under piles of private archives and preserving remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision-makers throw their bulldozers at our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When, a platform for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states help the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in distress as a result of the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by nationalizing it in part. The three countries support, with an interest of 11.2 billion euros in financial aid and a financial contribution of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, on this matter, also by appealing to the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition manager.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been intensifying for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, the three states will buy back nearly half (49%) of the bank’s capital in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell some of its shares, among which, first of all, the activities, essentially insurance, it acquired last year from the Dutch agency ABN Amro.
In the second half of the week, serious signs of a crisis have already been revealed at the bank, which is why the Fortis stock has fallen sharply.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too large to be let go to bankruptcy.
Only on Friday, the company’s shares fell 12 percent, reaching its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, shares have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group’s capital is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company’s executives, is not realistic.
The management of the company accuses the uncertainty of the overseas Atlantic, in connection with the adoption of the US $700 billion bailout plan, of being at the origin of the fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the fund.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's clientele circle and no agency was attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market is becoming uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of information regarding the prescription of drugs, in all cases, to the consent of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it’s up to you to entrust your chicken to a fox,” Richard Dicket, the program’s creator used to manage medication prescriptions, told the Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and the insured capital in case of damage, the health status of the client who is present, and if they feel that the risk is too high, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent the candidates for a medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after learning about the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, it is easily provided to pharmacies, data on the person's drug purchases over the past eighteen months. From this, the program itself determines what health is and what health the person is suffering from.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts it in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk factor, so there is little left to do to the insurer other than paperwork. However, minor problems may still arise.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for various purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or heat stroke, but they can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others, no.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data. They must ask for permission from the patient before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their failures in the past.
Recently, some companies have also been treating laboratory analysis results and linking them with data on drug use, so they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and control over usage is becoming increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill on expanding the control circle of the authorities concerning companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
This is another question of whether the person concerned is truly free to give his or her consent, since if he or she refuses, insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
Thus and ultimately, chickens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are multiplying their trade by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other, largely global, problems.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit where it will be mainly a matter of cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is a major emerging democratic power to which a broader right of expression in international affairs should be given, but member countries have not yet been able to agree on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not pay much attention to this issue yesterday at the 9th summit in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in a thousand years, they would multiply by two cents, which means the exchange of two cents.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods increased from $25 billion to $55 billion, this does not appear to be an over-ambitious objective.
In this sense, they have harmonized from a legal point of view the 26 bilateral agreements with India concerning civil flights, which will also allow air exchanges to take their course in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, which is the EU's first trading partner, on the one hand, and New Delhi, on the other, which ranks only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation has been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a UN conference on this issue has been mentioned.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle was also requested, although both have a large part in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains loyal to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic substances by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the fact that it would be necessary to pass a global market at next year’s climate conference, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by fifty percent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is heading to the French capital today, where at a bilateral meeting, he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the press agency, the agreement would last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
A strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for this edition, more than 7 exhibiting miles from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Exhibition with more than 403 thousand titles on display, and Turkey as an honorary guest.
It will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: indeed, Italy will be present institutionally, with an Italian Point - 264 square meters of space.
It will be followed by the meeting with the press in the Room Struktur, at the pavilion 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books is gradually decreasing compared to the total Italian production, and in particular, compared to that of adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying in the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a 3,000-meter-high plateau in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
"The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it's all about the one Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared," he said at a news conference.
The sheriff said no human remains had been found on the plane or in the area.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the discovery of the wreckage, a team of investigators sent to the scene, identified the device: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Neerington at 3:00 p.m.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal effects were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
In the sixth attempt, he became in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had toured the world on a plane and without a ladder.
Among all these records, also that of flying at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ad you're not expecting.
An unusual 4x4 of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and net angles.
This is, in short, Glk, the last born of the “compact” off road of the star’s house, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a breath of fresh air in this sector.
Precisely because of its non-standard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, starting October 17th.
Thus, the publicity stunt that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milan’s shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication foresees the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, one will have the impression that when looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertisement, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future buyers? We will see well.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created big problems.
He had never met the opposing typhoids.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (not really) of Campania and Poulles were added.
They had tricolor flags on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday night, they were all removed so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by the English typhus.
In Bulgaria, they found a typhus of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian fans, 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had in fact controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had an ongoing Daspo, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian typhus who had a history of stage crime, had no right to the ticket, and could not make the move.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, it may be that the typhus arrested or identified in the disorders purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits attending Italian, but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer stand at the stage.
Happily.
But now is the time for fear-emulation: that is, others are at risk of adding to the first hundred and fifty.
“We need to put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves this way,” Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes open especially for Wednesday's national team match in Lecce"
In the Poulles there is indeed a small core of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow, the Observatory will meet, on Tuesday the Casms, which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is, secret services, which are precisely dealing with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duke choirs, and the arm stretched during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Observatory of the Viminal (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a prefect in Trieste, where a core of supporters of the group Ultras Italy resides, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 typhoids has been shameful.
“I am not a sociologist,” adds the Observatory’s No. 1 – “crimes must be attributed to the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had remained in the rules, now we will see well what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about whistles to Mameli’s anthem: those are also not crimes, but if you allow me, they are not cops.”
