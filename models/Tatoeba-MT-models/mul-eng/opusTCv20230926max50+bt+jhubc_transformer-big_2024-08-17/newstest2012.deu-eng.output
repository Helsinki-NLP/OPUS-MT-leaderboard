No Liberating Novels for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected the request to abolish those paragraphs on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko had been convicted as part of a novella of the Criminal Code.
The new rules, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned former prime minister, were rejected by MPs at the second reading of the request for a reduction of the penalties for economic crimes.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly detrimental contract with Russia over the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet in force, in December the appeal of the convicts is to be heard in court.
Tymoshenko himself describes the verdict as political revenge of the regime and also in the West the trial raised the suspicion of the bias of the court.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Minister of State for the Extremism was condemned to remove from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libya's victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Only the winners need to be defined.
As is customary for this region to win in the Islamist elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council became familiar with the customary law of the Shar<0xC4><0xAB><0xCA><0xBF>a, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would go to the country without criminality, because for theft, the hand is briefly cut off.
Women, too, should forget about emancipation as soon as possible, if any deviations from the faith are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Koran in the future from opposing tribes.
In short, there will be an order in Libya that is hardly imaginable in this country and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only one and objectively seen is probably not the best and variety would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans.
In this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters could have been helped by the unbelievers dogs at all.
To her apology, perhaps, only the fact that NATO’s airstrikes were not directed by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose all-powerfulness was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in a shoot-out, served the interests of Islam and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally without bringing any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the locals are starting to worry - namely, the expulsion of the crusaders.
But do the mineral oil companies also get the black gold at the spot price without occupation?
Perhaps hardly, and so the West can finally boast of its right to selflessness in the protection of human rights.
If they do not, the Shar<0xC4><0xAB><0xCA><0xBF>a representatives will destroy them.
Beginning of a new era of crisis
France and the rest of Europe are focused on investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm depth across Europe was needed.
The individual states published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France added.
Today, however, the bond market is breaking all records.
Investors not only keep an eye on Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, which is 0.4% by France.
Both countries simultaneously corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than had originally been expected (growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France allowed a slight decrease by 0.1% (original data were only stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, the gross domestic product stagnated, and according to Statistics Norway, the trend of growth slowdown in economic performance was confirmed.
So the results are worse than the forecasts of the analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonal figures, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the euro area as a whole and in the EU, between July and September, the economy recorded a growth of 0.2 percent compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The return on its 10-year government bonds increased the value of 28.45%.
The yield of Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also starting to feel problems...
The return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, even if the situation in the region worsens.
In Germany, the ECB is said to be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task of the entire season!
Thanks to a well-placed goalkeeper <0xC4><0x8C>ech and a magnificent goal by Petr Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, they won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advantage from the home game and will not miss the European Championship again.
IHNED.cz followed the ascent game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won quite happy 1:0 thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Czech and the hero of the day Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek in Montenegro and has thus redeemed their ticket for the football championship.
Also because of the precise defense of the Czech team, they were able to put more pressure on the Montenegrins in the second half.
The bad birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech team will participate in the European Championships next year, and it is also gratifying that a prize of approximately 200 million will be awarded to domestic football.
From the first few minutes on, quite competitive football was played.
Both teams combined for a long time and so were mainly played around the midfield.
Even in the second half, the pressure of the home team remained, and the wide cuts in front of the penalty area were successfully defended by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred college students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country’s nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the facility on Tuesday afternoon and then announced the US and Israel’s death.
A few hundred students from the University of Isfahan in Iran formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
In doing so, they wanted to make it clear that they are ready to protect their country’s core program, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has apparently not given up on its efforts for a nuclear weapon.
Also in Israel talks about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon before the entrance to the complex and then announced the death to the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack on Iran’s nuclear program, the Israeli press said the nuclear enrichment facility in Isfahan would also be the target of the attack.
The menu of a fat-thirsty child: It does not breakfast and eats sausage for dinner
More than a third of children between 9 and 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that adipose children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
Once again, it shows how important for a person’s healthy development is the environment in which he grows up and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of adipose children, sausages are up to half as common on the table as in families where normal weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had apples for dinner the day before the educational campaign under the motto "Adipositas is no coincidence".
In families with dicks, sport is not just one of their favorite occupations, but also the majority of today’s students – only 15 percent responded that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, during which almost 900 children from primary schools were surveyed throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action "Adipositas is no coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Fund and the company Unilever.
To date, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th grades have participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarmingly increasing number of overweight or even obese children.
“Only half of the children surveyed, for example, had five times a day, in the breakfast-second breakfast-breakfast-vesper-dinner mode – one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet,” one of the survey results reads.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relative small things, such as the family’s regular breakfast time, are important for a child’s healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students’ families have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone has breakfast on their own.
The worst was the finding that is not breakfast at all in every tenth family.
Breakfast is considered to be the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
Among other things, the survey showed that unhealthy apples are consumed much more often in families of overweight children.
And almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent)
While more than 40 percent of the children surveyed do sports, only less than half of their parents do so – only 15 percent.
Set up your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to come up with their own meal plan from offered options according to appetite and opinion.
“What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite foods were many flour dishes, meat dishes and, of course, sweet foods.
"Especially alarming is the great popularity of sweet lemonade," the final report emphasizes on this survey.
At lunch, that is, the main dish, the doughnuts almost won in front of the poultry.
The children almost did not like herring and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Approaching to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the conclusion of the exploratory lecture "Adipositas is not a coincidence", in many cases a significant shift in preferences towards principles of healthy eating was noted in the results of the project.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed much more often poultry or fish as the main dish of the day and were willing to eat fewer noodles or sweet foods.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I had a bit of a masque that was a bit too much fabric for the beginning.
I didn’t even know what was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the square" is going.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the exam goes, the more information and practical tasks ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully booked.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (not a single man takes part in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have an ideal proportional figure.
After all, these are most of us.
One has too short a neck, the other a figure too youthful without proper curves, and again others are slender.
It is up to the stylist to visually mask wide shoulders, extend the neck or enchant the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to attract a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with a large bust, wide hips and a narrow waist - pretty and figure-focused without making her seem too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so large that the skirt or pants really don’t fit, you should be able to cut at least one piece to measure.
You won’t regret that, because good sitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt you feel much better than in one of the poles, which always slips up and down in the waist, etc.
Boys-like figures can in turn be allowed to wear clothing with pleats, bows, applications, embroidery or rafting.
With this lot of information and character types, I’m glad I have a whole week of time to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I am afraid that in view of the homework that has been ordered, it is almost impossible to create.
Each of the course participants was awarded a promi, for which she is supposed to come up with suitable outfits - day clothes and evening clothes.
In this case, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm going to "dress Miranda Kerr" you might know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the interior I rejoice, because this is much better for me personally than to dress for example Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to a hundred pounds in recent times (well, that’s a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We are supposed to cut out the pieces of clothing from magazines or search, print and then edit graphically on the Internet.
In the "moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should then be expressed.
After all, it is very important to also think about the graphic side of styling.
The stylist not only physically attracts the models, but also shapes the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
This was told by stylist and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k.
But that's only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about figure types, was equally spiced up by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit it.
And a dedicated stylist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in a very different way.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over the jeans as usual, i.e. like a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heels and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to raise the sleeves or the collar and the whole look looks very different.
"Played with it," he stressed.
But most of all, I was given the following advice: "First of all, you have to know the rules perfectly."
“Only then can you hurt her,” Jacob said.
Finally, it becomes clear to me why we need to paunch all these tutorials, what to combine with what and why, even if you often get to see quite different in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared far more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (say ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
With all this, you have to count on the design of the outfit.
That image and style sometimes make up half of the success, this was also confirmed by Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>.
There you only need to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Even well-known personalities often consider this to be money thrown out (the main thing is that I bring something as I look at it is second-rate).
And if one of us is already able to style ourselves, then we should expect that he or she will most likely force us a very different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google to determine with certainty that the boulevard press writes, the corresponding celebrity has returned to or declined, etc.
Jan and Mario put us at the heart on Sunday, not believing that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then the outfit needs to "build up".
In his work, he must communicate primarily with the people he stylizes and he must be a seasoned psychologist.
People appreciate it without praying and standing up for it.
"If any manager orders us to see her wardrobe and to complement pretty pieces, then we can't clear the whole closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
“You have to find at least a few commendable things to recommend what you can wear to it,” says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what a so-called "place bag" must involve.
So such a bag that you click on the waist and in which you carry all the necessary properties with you.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, hair removal rollers or safety needles, it also contains such tools as a nylon thread (thus the stylist helps himself to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are not sewn to the back, if the cloth is too big, or if the cloth is too big
But so that we can not only listen, but also try something practical, we learned how to properly glue shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is straight, you can damage the sole of the shoe, let alone the outside.
We were squeezing and squeezing...
With the scissors you should not even touch the shoes, so that you do not damage them.
So you really have to act skillfully.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
After all, the skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was only the fraction of what we got to hear at the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - to dedicate yourself to styling on a professional level is not a children's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Reviewer
The original carefree ride is made by a series of completely avoidable, dilettant mistakes for the routine ride to the early layer.
While it did manage to fulfill the ambitions for the most part, what good is that even if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the shop tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" raised high expectations.
However, he promised to move the already-defunct "Need for Speed" game series back into a new dimension, and in the playable demonstration examples, he actually didn't seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious as to how the adapted passages fall out, in which the main protagonist rises from the car and continues on foot.
But as you are used to at NFS, in the end, it’s a lot different than you expected.
Sure - potentially it's quite decent arcade racing, but overall the game is tempered by some superfluous mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years already.
So it’s actually no longer a mistake, but rather a sign of a basically incomprehensible foulness of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, one is introduced to the story, whose main character Jack has certain problems of a personal nature; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, so on the west coast, you get on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different route and that the individual stages take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
One does not have the impression that the game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are still quite nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the ride through the desert, through autumnal landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape seems visually very pleasant.
Over and over again, unusual elements bring a little variation in the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm, which greatly restricts sight.
In the mountains, you have to be absolutely careful not to be smothered by an avalanche.
In addition, the individual races are installed quite well behind each other.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to pick up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you expect another personal duel with a single opponent.
And the police are also involved, who want to mess up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages where Jack leaves the car.
It’s more about some interactive animations where Jack escapes from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
However, it is surprising that there are far fewer such passages in the game than one would expect (specifically only three).
Ultimately, this is more of an advantage, because so this element has at least no chance of getting bored - it belongs in the context of the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model steps into the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today’s point of view, although it does not tear out trees, on the other hand, one could not claim that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you need to look elsewhere.
But an action-packed race will continue to suit the local driving model quite well, although one could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in the best order.
Real problems only appear after a certain period of time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not quite O.K.
From a game of this kind it is hardly to be expected that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: When passing or passing through the cars you "strip" in some places the other car only easily, but in other situations, almost identical, you get into the loop and turn wild pirouettes.
Or drive the cart straight to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn’t matter, it’s all annoying.
The restarts are solved as follows: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then one throws the game back to the last point of entry of the track.
Only - in each race you only have five restarts.
Once you’ve exhausted them, everything goes from the front.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn’t work out, but you shouldn’t rely on it.
But sometimes it doesn’t even help the restart, there’s nothing else that helps to learn the critical section from the head.
It is extremely unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some curves need to be traversed in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit through.
Elsewhere you meet at the appropriate place "civil" cars always in the same configuration, whether you come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see that the counterparty passes in front of a playing on two opposing cars, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you get there, everything is designed so that it always comes close to your nose.
Contractors have other advantages.
Throughout the game, there are a few places where you are always taken over by the same opponent at the same place and also here again regardless of the time.
The craziest thing is to finish the game on the long bridge, which you pass in the opposite direction.
The contractor must obviously get one out of here on the devil.
And if he is in front of one, then he takes the view of one of course, so you start there your own car a few times in Klump.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly loses the joy of the game.
And that’s a shame, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is overall quite entertaining and quite loaded with action, so you almost don’t know where one of the heads is anymore.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "guilty" is - the concept of fifty unique routes, the arrangement of races in a way that can't be tolerated, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the car change in the course of the races.
You should not miss the petrol stations on the route, because here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you just have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical rides, for example on the mountain Serpentines.
Hand in hand with the game history mode also goes the task mode (challenges) - i.e. the races in the individual locations known from the story.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points for own profile, which is common for tasks (challenges) and history.
To get to the higher level of the driver, different objects have to be opened: from the car to the background for the profile.
This is simultaneously associated with the online Autolog function, which compares its own results with those of other players and also provides other collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible scissors is a situation in the final race of history.
Here you get by car into a subway tunnel (my way), where in the dark you rest on the rails for a long time (my way).
On the tacho, numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (meetings), but there comes at once from behind a subway and drives an uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial board, we will probably be arguing for a long time about whether that was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think us so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases quite appealing and here and there even brilliant.
All the more annoying is that at some exciting moments, the image repeat frequency becomes slower and this sometimes becomes quite dramatic.
However, this is particularly true of accidents involving a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound reproduction is O.K. and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to as wide a scale as possible to a more youthful audience, a soundtrack a la was created "of everything" - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
Had the game not been mitigated by the aforementioned totally unnecessary errors, we could have argued with the chest tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that’s how the game seems unfinished.
A great pleasure for yourself, but you should be prepared to face these mistakes with the power of airport headlights.
Concert of the "Students of the Contemporary Revolution" with singing ensembles of the Charles University
The Festa Academica Festival now offers for the third time the entertainment of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Samtene Revolution and this, together with music experience.
During the course of the festival, twenty specialist and university choirs will present themselves.
The main focus of the festival is the two concerts that take place on November 17.
"Karlsuniversit<0xC3><0xA4>t has a large share in the festival."
"The participants are also represented by the choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanistic Studies and, among other things, the Rector V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Hampl sits on the festival committee," said Jakub <0xC4><0x8C>aloun, head of the organizing team.
The absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of professional school choirs, which will take place on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice on November 17th from 2 pm.
On the program is the composition of the important Czech jazzer Karel R<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ka "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evenings, the concert "Students of the Contemporary Revolution" (Studenty Sametu) takes place in the gallery rooms of the Volkshaus in Vinohrady, where university choirs are also performed, not excluded.
Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate the World Student Day and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but to present to the public Chorus music at the highest level and to promote the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organizer is the association of Czech choirs in cooperation with Johannes-Kepler-Gymnasium.
Bohuslav Svoboda, the mayor of the capital Prague and V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Hampl, the rector of the Charles University, took over the patronage over the entire event.
The festival takes place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and in Pardubice.
In addition to party concerts, the schedule also includes numerous music meetings, student happenings, matinees and other events.
Detailed information can be found on the website of the festival www.festaacademica.cz
EU Ambassador Vice-President:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has left the balance between the individual institutions appreciably out of whack."
I would not have expected such a hard war to be waged.”
"It will take five or six years for the wagons to smooth out and get used to their new role," Milena Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
In the first part of her lecture, in which she was able to describe the individual bodies of the EU and their mutual relations in such a way that they can be seen and understood in such a way that they can be heard by some lecturers of the Faculty of Law.
Ms Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
“In the beginning, criticism was loud that he was too inconspicuous — a gray official who didn’t grow into such a role, but I have to say, it took everyone’s breath away, how well he took it.
“He is a person who is ready to listen patiently to twenty-seven Member States, to communicate with them, and who has, above all, clear ideas of how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it as an answer to the question: Who is this really - the European Union? What number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards agreement and better readability of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us our oil-repellent Quargel
Ms Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also devoted herself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived, lives and remembers to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago called it a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the presidency referred to it as a major negative, which severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has all hands to do.
In the words of the Ambassador, it was quite hectic not only in the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome.
And there is still a need to approve the EU’s seven-year budget, which makes it much more complicated precisely because of today’s economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and economical budget, which economic sectors will receive priority, which countries will be more and which will be less supported - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Understanding Europe".
“If I don’t like something, then it’s horrible abbreviations, foreign words and professional jargon that no one understands.
How am I supposed to know, as a citizen, whether you really think about curds or round cucumbers and various large bananas in Brussels, or whether someone actually wants to ban us from the quark.
She would also have liked to use the EU’s soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are in the limelight of being Eurosceptics, who perceive more the negatives than the positives of the matter.
All the more annoying is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
This is due to many factors, including the retention of our candidates, their inability to write letters of motivation and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, then the Frenchman next to me thinks, 'Hey, what are you doing with your heads - is this your V4 again?' and makes a rather acid mine.
According to Ms Vicenové, the EU is expecting tough rules for Member States' budgetary policies in the future.
As much more real than a "European Federation", she sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
“We have here the countries of the Eurozone and the countries outside the Eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
“For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want it to work together and those that don’t want it should stand still.”
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong 'Europe of different speeds'," Ms Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
In this regard, it also praised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle, according to which all issues with an impact on the whole of the EU must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the countries of the Eurozone.
Brand Story:
The IBM Innovator Enters the Second Century of Its Existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word that most accurately characterizes IBM’s strategy, then this would probably be the word “sustainability”.
For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although it has been around for a century since its founding.
The basis for this longevity was already laid by her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson.
Already he represented the slogan, countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" became the hallmark for the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which was published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
“For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was therefore successful for a century because it remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around it.
This allowed us, in the course of our first century, to transform the technologies, the business and also society.
We hope to do even more in the next hundred years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
Perceived system
Watson was already in the thirties of social care of his employees - in a similar way to the entrepreneur Bat<0xC3><0xA5>a in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had as one of the first American employees paid leave, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms and uniforms as work clothes.
IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are equally sophisticated.
The company has been brilliant in talent promotion from the start – as one of the first companies in the world, IBM raised any discrimination – and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan to replace Palmisan at the top of IBM next year is also being replaced by a woman - by Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she has taken the position of Sales, Marketing and Strategy Manager.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, in the company almost half a million people are employed.
An institution with a good reputation
Your unshakeable position in business guarantees the company a strong image, both inside and out.
“From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than just a technology company,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor at Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” said George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be only present on the market or to form it directly through that presence.
IBM - named in the states of its logo because of its familiar "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever – IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services across an incredible product range – from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM owns the most patents and already five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
Among his most well-known inventions are, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes or even the floppy disk.
With approximately $220 billion in market capitalization, IBM was the second-largest technology company (just like Apple) this year, surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The view ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunately, for example, the trial with their own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC Jr.
“Business is based on the forward movement, so you can’t emotionally bind yourself to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM doesn’t have a problem building its foundation walls on different platforms – and if they don’t work, leave them again.
Unlike the Microsoft counterpart, which basically stands and falls with its Windows operating system.
Promising technologies
IBM’s profits are largely driven by services, software, and hardware, accounting for one-fifth each.
In 1990, hardware with a share of more than fifty percent was the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yielding assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-proof technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the recent financial crisis for the first time swept across the world like a storm.
Here too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment volume in the midst of the great global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the company IBM survives the current crisis undamaged.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008 and the company’s net profit continues to grow.
IBM’s corporate slogan is: everything can change – only the values don’t.
That is why it is also expected that this flexible giant will also face the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to World Flights
Founded a hundred years ago in New York City, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It was not until 1924 that IBM took over the name - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The cornerstone of IBM’s later company was the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 80s of the 19th century.
They had technologies such as the famous flashcard clocks to register the start and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
This leader then even put IBM’s founders in the shadows – based on Watson’s ideas to this day, the company’s invincible culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the manufacture and distribution of all kinds of machines for trade - from sausage and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four decades that Watson ran the company, he doubled its sales to $9 million and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the chief chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM’s engineers and computers helped direct NASA’s flights into space – to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 also the famous human flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture – the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that set the computer standard of that time came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consulting part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus entered fully into the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the past three years is the “Smarter Planet” concept.
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not previously planned, for example, to improve the situation in traffic and in urban administration.
In the commercial sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smarter Commerce” platform, which is meant to help traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Already in 1932, IBM established a branch in the then-Czechoslovakia – as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and here is also a top-level research team of world-class that deals with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> about her unfaithful spouse:
Iveta - you can keep this ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (53) became their lover from the protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (45), Darina still had the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of her life she has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
When Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> had offered refuge to singer I. Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> in her own house, she probably wouldn’t even have fallen into a dream of how to deal with her husband.
When Iveta moved back and forth to <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>any after 30 days on her urges, Joseph immediately went with him.
He even knew publicly that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, even as if she wanted to reconcile herself with her unfaithful husband – but now she finally gave him the pass.
Rychyt<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> it does not matter who his wife sleeps with
If Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> is to leave in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
“He’s the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, I won’t chase him out.”
"Nevertheless, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a man to whom I still have certain ties," said Mrs. Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1>; but she also said that she had already emotionally separated from him and insisted on mutual decency alone.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door to him carries Joseph with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
“With Darina, I’m having a normal conversation, but we don’t share the bed,” said J. Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn’t want to stop her.
“We don’t sleep with each other, so I don’t care if she has a friend or who that is.
It is clear to me that this is my fault, I have fallen in love with Iveta and therefore I take all responsibility.
The Worst Female Unconsciousnesses: What's Up With You?
If you ask the men to name some typical female malnourished, then they throw some out of the sleeve without exception.
Dear Women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we again pass a few unsatisfactory revues, which let men shed blood in the veins?
Search for shopping
Do you want your spouse to be a shopaholic?
Do you have to buy at least one hater a week?
Would you like to go shopping and it may be a bit more for promotions?
In your case, it’s really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their desire to shop semi-controlled.
But hand on heart, what woman is it that can’t stand looking for a well-dressed top just to bulge through a clothing store and not to try out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Although shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how many times you’ve told your husband you’d rather stay outside.
Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
“I would have to lose at least five pounds – should I start jogging or do gymnastics?”
“Do you like me at all?”
Does this seem familiar to them?
- Yeah?
Then you probably belong to the women who are actually obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn’t mean you should let yourself go for a long time, but many men are allergic to it if their wife constantly regrets her appearance.
The stronger sex is in agreement - with the increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly intolerant.
Cleanliness and cleanliness in the first place
It is a battle against windmills.
Cleaning windows, wiping tiles and dust, shaking bathtubs - and this at least twice a week.
Do you mess with your partner because he is trampling again with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, did you peel the children, because the just scrubbed sink is already dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet already has fingerprints again, where does polishing make so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviant", then you should know that you must not overdo anything and that order and cleanliness in family life do not stand in the first place.
This immoderate sense of purity can ultimately also harm the mutual relations and, above all, the peace in the family.
Sticheln
" Dirty turn pants come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to wear the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that this brings him to the palm.
Of course, that’s not bad, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to disguise so much.
Clatsch and Tratsch
Some women like to gossip and toss, they are squealed behind their backs or even defamed or you forge alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, which is why they like to hone through such topics as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably each of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and shit in stock.
Hands on the heart - this is probably the case for all women.
However, this is not to be confused with the most grotesque calibres, to which nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone in their environment and who pose a significant danger especially to women’s collectives.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr and Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek helped Philadelphia win with their assists
Ice hockey striker Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr played a big part in the 5:3 win over Philadelphia on the Carolina ice with two assists on Monday, making him the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux was the beneficiary of the review of the 39-year-old ice hockey star, who added another assist and was named the best player of the match.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr's co-player Jakub Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek also recorded two assists in the same game.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr claimed to journalists after the game that he had a great evening of prophecy by Giroux.
“Before the game, I told him he had a hat trick today.”
I kind of felt that.”
"He's got a feeling like that every now and then," explained J<0xC3><0xA1>gr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal in the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek fought the puck behind the Hurricanes gate and introduced him to the successful Maxim Talbot between the circles.
One second before the first-third knockout, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hand, but the second-third then again belonged to the Flyers.
Concrete Giroux.
In collaboration with J<0xC3><0xA1>gr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds led his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the best three," J<0xC3><0xA1>gr said.
“I wouldn’t have thought in my life that I would play with an ice hockey player like him at the end of my career.”
"I'm very pleased with that."
"I'll cut my game on me."
“All the years in the NHL my teammates put their game on me and now the spit is turning,” J<0xC3><0xA1>gr said.
Carolina made the game even more dramatic - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who stepped out of a penalty shootout, came to a gate.
However, Matt Read prevented any further complication in which he was in excess of two against one.
"Excellent acting proger still in our zone."
"He got the puck, I took the ride up and (Read) pulled to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out," Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last match from his point of view.
By this victory, Philadelphia was at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek injured himself in the game against Buffalo and fell out in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Candiens also beat their lead an unlost penalty shoot 2:3.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec was unable to turn one of the penalty shots.
More than the lost points, the home team coach probably hurt the high disease-related downfall in the defensive - they only ended the game with five defensive players.
"That's bad."
"We played the match with only one experienced player to finish, the rest were young players."
“But there’s nothing we can do, so we have to be done,” said Jacques Martin.
“With every shift, one attack wave after another and we had nothing to counter that.”
"We should have made the game easier and had to get the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here,” said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and contributed significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters took part.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five licensed state travel agencies in the then <0xC4><0x8C>SSR: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
At that time, the travel agencies sold mainly only trips to the socialist Eastern bloc countries, in the West only the chosen ones were allowed.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic (in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Scotland on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (also the Czechoslovak) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even then the travel agencies also offered to travel to the West, but then you had to buy huge snakes or even sleep in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good friends" in the travel agency.
Even so, this had not happened for a long time.
The so-called currency statement - the condition for a trip to the West - was granted only to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a currency pledge it would have been impossible to raise the necessary funds (western currency) for a trip to the West.
Therefore, the vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays abroad, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and daisies - a habit that continues to this day.
The combined revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs on their feet.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox that you are no longer aware of today is the fact that you could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989 at all, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, foreign exchange obligations were lifted in neighbouring Western European countries, resulting in a huge wave of short visits mainly to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovaks simply could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
This is how Czech vacationers slept when traveling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have had the money for a hotel or a pension at the time.
A typical feature when travelling abroad from the Czech Republic at the time was a fully packed trunk with canned, beer and permanent sausages, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy the western currency freely.
Our standard of living and, as a result, the average wages increased, which brought us to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, after 1997, travel agencies began to regularly prepare for charter flights, making flights incredibly affordable in comparison to the past, thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already had currencyless payment transactions with all the highly developed countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-office" travel came in 2000, when thanks to the high demand of the first direct charter flight was delivered to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, every year, direct charter flights with Czech passengers fly to distant sunny countries; this year you fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
The 100 Tsd. Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the era that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) for the first time in their history, spending more than CZK 15 per person for a single holiday, including the cost at the resort.
The General Assembly is supposed to find a new chairman - again a pact is threatened.
For almost five months now, Czech football has been without a chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not be known even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To this day, there is still no agreement on which electoral order to be elected.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
In June, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned from his post, urging his colleagues at the time of his resignation to agree and find a strong personality that could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the old quarrels broke out again between the two chambers of association, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This turned out to be rocky and clear on September 16 when the new chairman should be elected.
The delegates of the main meeting had come to the People's House in the Prague district of Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov for nothing, because the negotiation did not lead to any result and it was not only about the election itself.
In fact, it was not even possible to agree on who was actually entitled to vote in the assembly - only the statutory representatives or even the officials with a power of attorney.
At least in part agreement was reached on this single point, which was also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, whose opinion was not valid on a proxy basis.
However, disputes over the electoral system continue.
Even the Executive Committee did not bring any clarity to the matter at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle nothing else is on the agenda at all.
Even if the views regarding the election changed a few times - the neural point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a patt situation?
"The point of contention concerns the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the statute, or whether a completely different model needs to be found," said Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R representing professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
M<0xC3><0xA4>hrer is said to be willing to compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds no longer make sense, this mode would question the whole two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, who would best find it not to bend the electoral order, but to choose according to the valid statute.
Surprisingly, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k agrees with this, even though it is clear that the statutory electoral order of all candidates is most likely to be against Pelta.
"My wish is to be elected to the fullest extent according to the statute."
"So that no unreasonable substitute variants are devised, as at the last general meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who is running for the first time and, in his statements, stood out above all against Pelta.
However, Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football championship today would certainly contribute to calming the spirits."
“If football only rides on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater,” says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience from all three adepts, both at a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is, unfortunately, ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to 'turn' the regulations for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a re-blocking at the General Assembly is not excluded."
“I hope, however, that common sense will ultimately prevail,” Rajchl said.
Just - a lot of time to agree to all the pages is no longer left.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the qualifying game.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl were supposed to fly to Podgorice, was not able to start in Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction and so one was feverishly looking for a replacement variant, as one still brings part of the executive committee to the venue of the Barrage play.
After all, the meeting at the ministerial level is probably crucial, which is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, the Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to move the divided parties within the country’s largest sports association to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state awards, the credibility of Czech football and also the upcoming main meeting of the <0xC4><0x8C>STV, which is supposed to give the Czech sport a new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k goes into the fight for the position of chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, the head of the Pilsner footballers before the extraordinary general meeting could have been a strong candidate who had fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not have stepped up the fight for these top positions.
"If there were a good advocate, I would fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
The main reason for Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to go into duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorites of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also emphasises that in the event of his victory, he intends to serve as chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to have seen an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football events.
“I’ve spoken to some people personally.”
“I can’t believe that some people told me they didn’t want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
“Such views would have changed,” he added.
Most of all, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k allegedly disrupts Pelta’s relationship with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegates’ votes at main meetings.
For Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta should have the position of chairman.
"In his victory, today's condition would be preserved and in Czech football it did not go forward at all."
“The support from Berbr, a smart businessman, has been twice as bad for football,” Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
He also points out that Pelta's name fell a while ago in connection with telephone interrogations for the purpose of investigating in a corruption case, but from which Pelta emerged criminally.
"I don't know what prestige a Pelta victory should bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who made his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes president", but he already sees a bit more relaxed.
Should Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k win the Thursday election, however, he can imagine a future collaboration with Pelta.
Likewise, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k before the main meeting in October, who ended up with a failure, thinks.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great skills."
"I could imagine him as the head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the association as a manager."
“I don’t put my nose in matters of which I don’t understand,” said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who in September had made sure that he was at the forefront of the appeals committee with Lu<0xC4><0x91><0xC4><0x9B>k Macela, replacing Dagmar Damkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k himself claims that he feels the role of the chairman of the association has grown.
And he is also the head of Pilsen, who, with his support in May, celebrated the first triumph in the league since last summer, relies on his ability to run private companies.
“I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of it.”
“In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and disciplinary commissions, which is up to the point of being in dire situations,” said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who did not shy away from his antipathy to Sparta chief Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>, for example.
As one of his priorities, he sees the strengthening of relations between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby top politicians for more money flowing from lottery tax into the sport.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should devote himself to."
“If it comes to taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but then they also have to be sharp and clear about where the money is going,” he said.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also does not see his connection to the Pilsner club as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R must be "super-partisan".
Pelta, in turn, is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to the Prague Dukla.
“This is not ideal.”
"But I don't think it makes much sense to transfer my shares in Pilsner Club seemingly sacred to a third party to return after a year and a half," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Pelta promised new statements by the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, which will rule out a patent situation in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election, he would make a strong case for the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R to obtain new statutes, which in the future will rule out disputes over the electoral order from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident and believes that the election campaign will be a sure deterrent in the event of a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team and the acquisition of funds in case of his election.
It was only at the last moment that he decided to participate in the election before the last general meeting, and so he liked the two-month break to help him defend his ideas about the direction of football and to present it in a wider context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels it's high time that the association is led by someone," said the man, who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, who also acted for many years at Sparta and on the Executive Committee.
That’s also why he believes he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are responsible for the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“Unfortunately, at the June general meeting, there were resolutions that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they hadn’t allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman by September,” Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the Civil Society Association that he used as a means of attraction for the delegates.
“If I were to become president, I would take it personally and be willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn’t work.”
“This is a principled thing without which it cannot be,” Pelta says.
In addition, he does not try to distance himself from his counterpart.
Earlier he had announced that he could imagine working with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, whom he recognized for his legal education, and he knew well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
Even Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k did not attack for a long time, which in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football, he has been moving for over a year and can already refer to certain successes."
“His attacks were repulsive, however, and many people were shocked by his election campaign.”
“That’s also why many doubt his real character,” Pelta addressed his counterpart, who probably remained true to his proclamations, which he had already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest playing classes to the national team.
And this should be the badge of Czech football.
“I would also try to end all business – from the Bohemian cause to the aftermath of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"Right after that, I would be rushing to negotiations with the private and state sector to secure sufficient funds for the entire football," said the six-and-a-half-year-old candidate <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean personal cleaning.
“I would have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees first,” he said in Strahov’s direction, where, due to the long anarchy, there is a sense of nervousness.
Despite the catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
“If the only point of contention is really how to choose the third round, we’re going to get over it.”
“Football needs credibility and it only wins back if it finally has a new leader,” Pelta remains optimistic two days before the potentially crucial day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will start working hard under him
If former deputy chairman Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl were to be elected as the new chairman of the football association of the Czech Republic at the general meeting on Thursday, this would allegedly elude many people in the association.
Rajchl promises to work hard in case of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football fields.
In addition, he promised to solve the case of Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work started by the previous chairman Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“As president, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole.”
From international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, professional football, to performance football for the youth."
“I don’t want to say that I want to do everything by myself,” Rajchl told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
"I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member devotes himself to a certain area."
And I’m going to do a lot of hard work to get football moving in every segment with mileage.”
Many wouldn’t be thrilled about it, because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves,” he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, I have considered not to run at all anymore.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
“But I need to know that it makes sense and that people behind me are standing behind me who don’t inadvertently throw a knot between my legs and question every step I take,” he said in a statement.
“A lot of people told me that I shouldn’t give up because other people would do the same.”
“It’s a trust you can’t play with,” he said.
Apparently, he also motivates him to continue the work he started under Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“In two years we’ve managed a big piece of work and I don’t want to throw that away.”
“Processes have been launched that will probably only come into effect in a few years and I would just hate to see them stop anyone,” he said, bringing his concerns to the fore that in the event that the other candidate – Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"He's got people behind him who would make football so he'd only be there for elected officials."
I may be able to claim one thing, but not that I would be biased."
“I try to be objective.”
"I want football for everyone, because then it's good for everyone and not just for the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for moles."
“For example, it’s time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which would then each rise to the first league.”
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moorish clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moors," Rajchl said.
Because now the head of the Pilsner club Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k has joined the fight for the role of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to appreciate his chances that he will be elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-president and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also led the saving of tens of millions of crowns for unfavourable contracts, the signing of contracts for television broadcasting.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not pull on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta, "he is from the beginning disqualified to help Czech football gain new confidence," he considers the second rival - Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
“No one can question that he did an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year.”
"If he were to be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek initiated and also the staffing in the commissions would obviously not change in principle."
He certainly wouldn’t want to turn things in his favor,” Rajchl said of his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Planschbecken in Ufo-Optik, Prunkpools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience its blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike, rest your tired legs in spas.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip in the last one and a half years, one in her luggage should not be missing: her swimsuit.
Laying back on the water, she looked high in artificially shaped domes, swam against marble wells waiting for her at the pelvis edge, and marvelled at the meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
She liked a bath, took it flying in her notebook - including knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored Meder in this way - and now presents her in her recently published book "Bath Joys": Volksswimmhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she led her "journey to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and in each case a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Switzerland.
The 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
With sport, she doesn’t have much on her hat, says Meder – only in the water is it different.
Angry only that swimming fans must find themselves with blue tiles and chlorine tank, while joggers can inhale the annoying scent of fir forests or listen to cheerful bird-swaggers in the park.
“One day I asked myself why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,” says the meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started to collect nice bathrooms."
Water surface doubles architecture
Plastering in the jumping pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is therefore so great because all the senses are served, according to Meder.
And when the builders have worked hard, swimming pools can be a real eye-catcher: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in bathrooms."
"On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, jump boards.
On 190 pages, the small-format picture book "Badenfreuden" conveys a wealth of knowledge about the architectural and cultural history of historic wellness oasis - but above all, it makes a leap into blue.
Notable specimens were discovered by the pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in a urinating karst cave (hole bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose pool is filled with alkaline water and is located in a bottle-shaped building in J<0xC3><0xA1>ro (V<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>fs<0xC3><0xA1>z).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: While you can see the whole city from the Zurich rooftop pool, you can look out the outdoor pool of a swimming pool in St. Anton on the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can bet on the drive.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bathing guests in L<0xC3><0xA4>ngenfeld: the <0xC3><0x96>tztal Aquadome looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
From three open shells it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal range into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector meder rose the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so strongly of heating oil that it is hardly believed to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrocarbonated healing water, which is almost black and whose slick sticks to the skin as soon as you can slide into the pool - a wellness experience of the special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing bath in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a secluded plot of land.
The bathroom, designed by the architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
As Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow art-style building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, the decline has been counteracted in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction already have this bathroom behind them; you can discover not only neo-romantic elements that date from the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, Palais Thermal has been the favorite swimming pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder – not only because it originally comes from the Black Forest.
“It’s already an achievement to merge such different styles into such a great unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a by-product.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank to lighten up raw material business
by Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the CEO wants to have consequences.
Hamburg - Hamburg
According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions exit this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In this, the author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges drives prices up – and so the banks are complicit in the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically directed against German bank chief Josef Ackermann, even if big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to hedge traders against price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, most experts agree that the sugars have decoupled from supply and demand – and at the expense of the poorest make profits.
Unlike the U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to review the allegations and said that no business was "worth putting the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank at stake".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the examination will be completed, then the results will be presented to the board of the Deutsche Bank - including a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the bank will announce the consequences.
In the end, a reduction in the commodity business could be, or even the complete reversal.
Ackermann bastels on his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial industry: "Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastic how ruthlessly banks are hurting the general good today."
Ackermann is now particularly in charge as a senior bank lobbyist.
“Deutsche Bank has to remove all of its assets from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices,” Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is about people suffering from hunger or about the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s insight comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not change to the Supervisory Board other than planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order for possible punishments, he hardly needs to shave himself - that would eventually have to do with his successor.
Every second would announce raw material plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Forsa Institute polled 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
In fact, 11 percent believe it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer food-priced facilities.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: every second, according to the survey, would cancel all facilities where money flows into raw material speculation.
43 percent of acquaintances from such a bank said they thought about canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21st house in Vienna
The Moving Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and happy end: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won prizes in 1958, was built in Vienna to the museum, stood empty and moved.
It is now reopened as an exhibition hall.
When heated by modern post-war architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is a striking and striking example of the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition.
Schwanzer's pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel glass construction.
To this day, the building is considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the Austrian Pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus a shell-like outbuilding in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
The pavilion, planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been erected in the Swiss Garden after the world exhibition at the Vienna S<0xC3><0xBC>dbahnhof and in 1962 a 20th-century museum was opened - it was called the "20th House".
However, the building was not suitable spatially and technically as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has converted the pavilion, he is now called "21er Haus" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a chance in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a distinguished art historian with a considerable career, among other things, in her youth as an ice skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, established the reconstruction in private with politicians and thinkers.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there should be a café and a bookstore, and an office building had to be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, small state
Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation for the execution.
Not only because he had significantly transformed and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "unprecedentedly important place" where he "looked at the exhibitions almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which was already lost in its relocation to Vienna and its re-use of generosity and lightness.
There were far bigger problems with the current conversion: the building was "an energy shifter," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel supports have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two basements brought space for the new use, a lowered light pit between house and street ensures the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in old reddish-brown rust protection paint.
And the cinema is still exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the memorial authority and with a small staff.
“Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the memorial protection office,” says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and modifications, the building is flexible and easy to maintain.
Whether it was difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels", Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city history".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken a true consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because there has been a city-building accident: around the Swiss garden is just the newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential buildings.
And another lucky chance may yet come: the 21st house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and as you hear, she already negotiates with the city for a neighbouring location in the Swiss garden.
Train Plans Winter Crisis Package in Millions
The train has elaborated a crisis plan to prevent train accidents in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
According to a newspaper report, Deutsche Bahn is spending over 70 million euros this year in the fight against winter-related train accidents and delays.
The "Image" newspaper reported in advance, citing a group internal crisis plan, that by 2015 investments of a total of around 300 million euros are planned.
This should ensure better availability of vehicles and rail network even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees for snow removal on railway installations and railways to 16,000 people.
The goal is to free railways up to the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary routes within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, Bahn chief R<0xC3><0xBC>diger Grube, after a summit with the government and industry, had warned of delays and delays this winter.
Last winter, the railway had significant problems in passenger traffic, as it lacked reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Office of Railways for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train has also been creating for years that it has to have axes of ICE trains checked much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE at the Cologne Central Station had an axle failure.
Deutsche Bank Pays Millions in U.S. Penalties
After the turmoil around Chef Josef Ackermann comes a new ungemach from the USA: the Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home weren’t enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now also bringing its past to the US: the Frankfurt Institute is paying 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes over the plethora of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA has accused a number of large banks of having misled the cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they would have played down the risks.
During the financial crisis, such papers were severely devalued and the banks were deeply shaken.
“We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court,” a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York said.
The bank was not to blame for the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed to paying $20.5 million.
NCUA chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the meeting of the two financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in litigation to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the billions of damage caused.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also tapped other major banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase sued the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The mortgages in question are so-called Mortgage-backed securities.
This is based on home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble hit in 2007, it became a disaster for a variety of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers died.
Even though the events are a few years away, the banks are currently facing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and supervisory authorities have tried countless lawsuits to obtain rebates or to adduce wrongdoings.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It claims 18 major international banks to have outperformed two U.S. state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage deals of around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to file a lawsuit with the FHFA, which is a number of transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurters stand for "substantial losses" without mentioning an exact sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unstoppable and declared that it wanted to hold back.
Warren Buffett to raise $10 billion at IBM
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in the IBM IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always stated not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies can only be badly forecasted.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s annual reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, the IBM IT-Urgestein can now be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett now revealed on CNBC that he has bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM knew anything about the engagement so far.
He praised the management, which, even in the economic crisis, had made decent profits.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
For some time now, IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies to date.
He says he only invests in companies he understands.
Instead, Buffett attacked a freight train, for example, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builders.
Its holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns not only about 80 of its own subsidiaries, but also shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Municher R<0xC3><0xBC>ck.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost indisputable sense of earning money has given him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of the Buffett investment, IBM’s stock rose by a provisionally one percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also known, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market in total, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, however, he did not want to step in.
Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Cell", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even talks about a "bloody ideology" that now resurfaces.
The murders of eight Turkish-Americans and a Greek small business owner between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This message is being answered in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
For many German-Turkishs, this brings back a long-awaited ghost: Since the fires in M<0xC3><0xB6>lln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
However, the fact that there is foreign hostility in Germany was never in question.
However, the uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is not yet foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" headlined the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Habert<0xC3><0xBC>rk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators was supposed to have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and shows concern that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany responded with a beneficence: it recalled the victims of racist violence on the weekend with a memorial guard in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had planned a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish contract.
In cheerful colors, it had been staged together - as a success story.
As an earring, the coverage of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet" cannot be taken to draw this mental connection.
"It's starting to stink," says the title of Ahmet K<0xC3><0xBC>lahci's column.
He stressed that people had been murdered, that taxes had been paid and that their work had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
Extremely critical is discussed in German-Turkish Internet forums the conduct of the police and their subsequent capture success.
Why the German authorities were not much more likely to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Some people show themselves at least rhetorically ready for drastic measures: "If we continue to slump here, then there is nothing left for the migrant but self-defense and armament."
"This will probably be the best self-protection".
“From the goodness of education and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the inner peace in Germany,” writes Selen.
What it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger, explains the attacks of M<0xC3><0xB6>lln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the Solingen fire ruins is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, exacerbated the sense of well-being on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at the time, especially the failure of German politics after the attacks was thwarted: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of M<0xC3><0xB6>lln.
After the Solingen fire, he sent a relief telegram to the Turkish presidents, but at the funeral in Cologne, he was represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in his speech how many taxes the local Turks were paying.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his tax.
The current reporting of the Turkish media shows once again how deeply the distrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been felt since then.
In addition to the efforts to comprehensively clarify and re-evaluate far-right terrorism in Germany, this time it needs open words.
The scandal bank of the Z<0xC3><0xBC>rich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now it's up to a German judge.
Axel Weber certainly didn’t think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would enter an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber publicly praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidity and made friendly comments about its future colleagues.
"The UBS has managed the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel".
In September, however, it became clear that everything was going to be different.
A UBS dealer in London had bypassed all of the bank’s security systems and scuttled around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the President of the Board of Directors of the UBS has also been regarded as a defendant - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been announced that Weber will be able to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he takes over the chairmanship of the board of directors already in May – not just in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is going to be tough.
He is not a banker, but rather an economics professor and a note banker and would certainly have needed a working time.
With one blow, he takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long earned the title of "Europe's largest scandal bank".
Because the UBS is huge on the one hand – until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world – and on the other hand has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, remains the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid but also outspoken Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, she was promoted to the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-time bank professor in Zurich, Hans Geiger, says: “My students have always set the UBS as a pattern of a good bank.”
“From today’s point of view, you ask yourself, ‘How could I be so wrong?’
He made a huge mistake.
In 2007, it was revealed for the first time that something was wrong with the UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli surprisingly stepped down, who until then was considered to be a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, he wondered why he had left.
The bank’s investment division had smothered itself with subprime papers and had to write billions off.
To shoulder this, the UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of say and write 13 billion francs.
For this, she actually found investors, but those who, until recently, had rubbed their noses over some of them: an intransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so secretive that one didn’t even know his name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, with the president of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel resigning in 2006 as the second highest-paid board in Switzerland.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS stood in the face of its misinvestments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank purchased the UBS for ten billion problematic securities, the Swiss Eidgenossenschaft gave six billion francs for a forced-wall loan, through which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic output of Switzerland (see chart).
“Once again, we couldn’t save the UBS,” says Bankenforscher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second one.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and declared willing to release the data of wealthy customers who might have taxed with the help of the bank.
In addition, it agreed to a payment of $780 million – in return for unjustified profits from these transactions including a penalty payment.
This made the UBS more or less known to have helped in tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the nimbus of silence.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer funds.
Within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking due to mis-speculations and in asset management due to aid in tax evasion.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just as you thought, now the UBS will get it back, then follows this ugly trader story: A single trader is choking 1.7 billion euros before the bank notices that something is going wrong.
And it becomes obvious: Risk management in investment banking obviously still does not work.
“In the case of Adoboli, one has to find that the risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the banking institute of the University of Zurich.
Even the chief financial officer of a large German bank is sure: “The problem with UBS is that it is not in control of risk.”
At the same time, it was precisely the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago joined to become custodians of the great wealth of the world: no too great risks, for security for money – even beyond the Alpine Republic, the world could collapse.
The vaults of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakeable reliability, such as Lindt and Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli for particularly fine chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the sophisticated Swiss private bank - it is just a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank has its headquarters at Zurich Railway Station, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, which is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are pristine, the storefronts are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers such as Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have lived here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius B<0xC3><0xA4>r.
You enter the reception hall of the UBS through a heavy turning door.
Inside, the walls are marbled, there are thick leather chairs, next to the bank logo a large sign to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point it has pushed – or betrayed – how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, he does business with the two big banks, like all Swiss bankers.
The UBS has become much too large, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons would have also spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the seats of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, gave it a high profit, and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million-dollar country decided the largest rescue action in the history of its nation," author Lukas H<0xC3><0xA4>ssig writes in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or around 45 billion euros, are approved by politicians to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks joined a huge group.
There was a bank that was already too big for the small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and grew ever further.
It helped that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS complemented each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalized.
All of a sudden, the internationalized investment bankers came cheaply to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdominal man who has worked up from banking to the very top."
But Ospel ultimately relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake in the end: “He thought his models were the reality,” Geiger says.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear that there was overcrowding before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings where CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings documenting the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go, all the way up.
Some steps have already been taken.
She played at the very top in foreign exchange and stock trading.
However, corporate consultants who were commissioned raised a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime facilities.
It evolved into a huge machine that packaged and passed on securities to U.S. mortgage loans – but also kept risks on its own.
Even as other banks have long been looking for a way out.
“Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there,” says Bankenexperte Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after the other had to go when the attempts to clean up turned out more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS have become the head office and are still wacky to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has abandoned all the underlying business models.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: end with investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far.
But investment banking is expected to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
On Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only thought of as a transitional solution when the bank separated surprisingly from its predecessor Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel.
In the meantime, he has continued: he is to run the UBS business permanently, Z<0xC3><0xBC>richer Bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank back to the stand in the mid-nineties.
There are 3500 people there.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to earn money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is probably asking himself right now.
So far, he has only publicly stated that he and his wife will be looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe strained U.S. stock market
The menacing recession in Europe has taken the courage of U.S. investors to start the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
The threatening industrial production on the continent smothered the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the core.
The general facilitation of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be implemented.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass were still half full last week, not half empty – but now the problems were pushed back into the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, financial values were on the sales charts.
The Dow-Jones Index of Standard Values recorded a trade close by 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer varied between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange Index lost 0.8 percent and went from trading with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax agreed with a decrease of 1.2 percent with 5985 counters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is heading towards the end of the upturn.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
“We’re not an island, we’re dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get rid of a recession so quickly, and there will be further signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it is too early in his view to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle over the heap and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the stock price of the traditional group and initially made it nearly one percent higher against the trend in trading history.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of $170 per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America’s shareholdings declined significantly more than the market by 2.6 percent.
The company is making almost all of its shares at China Construction Bank, and is worth $6.6 billion.
With the net profit from the business, the Institute wants to boost its capital ratio and thus meet stricter regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing added and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The share gained 1.5 percent after the Group had collected the largest order in its history.
On Sunday, Airline Emirates ordered 50 777-type long-haul machines and denominated the value of the orders to $18 billion.
Including options for 20 more machines, the volume even amounts to $26 billion.
At the New York Stock Exchange, approximately 710 million shares changed their ownership.
719 values added, 2281 gave up and 79 remained unchanged.
On the Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares closed 630 in plus, 1913 in minus and 82 unchanged.
Intelligent cranes are spreading in cities
In many places, seed crows are considered "problem birds": but the highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from the cities, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities, residents complain about the dirt and noise of animals.
So far, a remedy against the “problem birds” is not in sight.
Seed cracks can no longer be obtained from the cities, experts said at the first Kr<0xC3><0xA4>hensymposium in the East Frisian void.
There, experts from all over the federal territory advised on possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
The problems in cities also led to the land escape of the particularly protected seeds: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying the traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing cultivation and the cases of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Herbs are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs are found, among others, in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the district of negative headlines had taken place.
Critics had described the capture of the animals in bird traps and the slaughtering with dolls as particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, the mutilation, brings nothing," said the urban and landscape planner Werner Kl<0xC3><0xB6>ver from Leer.
Nester spraying away with water or falling trees, often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
"Animals fade out, large colonies split up and spread to other places."
Obstruction is only conceivable as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we can’t get them away.”
Without the surrounding area, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is conceivable that a combination of grazing the animals from sensitive habitats and shelter offers will be used to rehabilitate them elsewhere.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens argued for a completely different treatment of the animals: "We can finally tolerate a pickle in the face most self-confidently."
In Schleswig-Holstein, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Kr<0xC3><0xA4>hen-Lehrpath, which informs signers about the life of highly intelligent seed crows.
The project has already been adopted by tourists.
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of the birds: "There is a lot of communication that has a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed crows not only use tools to get to a tasty bite, but even produce their own tools as tools.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested four seeds of how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that with stones they had to bring a scaffold to collapse in order to get to a moth larvae.
Without much training, they purposefully recognized what size and shape a stone must have in order to make the platform collapse.
In a second attempt, the pfiffiches then had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larvae.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had placed wire pieces on them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then aimed the bucket at the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seedlings managed to do so.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championships
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for a coup remained.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland are at the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have resolved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.
Led by the double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd) Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth European Championship in a row perfect after 0-0.
The Czechs scored a 1-0 (0:0) in the play-off back game with Montenegro, after the draw (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
Croatia also failed to score in the 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland got a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga pro Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trade meter (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54).
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal made a custom start.
Ronaldo chased a free kick from around 30 meters for an early lead in the masques.
A good quarter-hour later, Nani showed off his high-scoring qualities and hit from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half of the hour, had their first clear chance by goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English table leader Manchester City put a head ball at the bottom of the latte, but the ball did not cross the torline (33).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Subsequently, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was at the center.
After an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36).
On the opposite side, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic safely transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-European Champion made it clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended the last doubt in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time that the 1976 European Championship has been held in a row.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC N<0xC3><0xBC>rnberg) were also lucky and had to survive a scare second in the initial phase.
Petr Cech prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9th) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its biggest chances when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
In the 40th minute from the turn from the penalty area, Damjanovic shot just past the gate of Cech.
After the break, the cross country had to save the Czechs for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper, again the striker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50th).
At the end of the day, the door finally made everything clear.
At the same time, Turkey missed the football wonder of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not get past a 0-0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to make his place on the bank of the 2002 World Cup third, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in an EM round.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met only the posts in the seventh minute with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim also could not sink the shooter in the goal.
After the second terror attack, however, Croatia took control more and more.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made his way from the 62nd minute for Dortmunder Ivan Perisic, the Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni goes to EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision in the 32nd minute with the 4-0 success in the playoffs.
Konstantin Vassilyev (57th) equals for the guests.
Ireland pushed on pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
It was only at the last moment that the Estonian back team prevented the possible leader.
But in the 32nd minute, that was enough.
After an unlucky defense of finalist Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software manufacturer SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, approximately two billion dollars (around 1.5 billion euros) will flow, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly,” Co-Chief Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of offices of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world’s more than 176,000 SAP customers are sitting in the boom country.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase sales to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers had recovered around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12.5 billion.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is running as rarely as before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
“Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education.”
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Fear: A History of the First World War, tells in nineteen halls of fortune" begins with a long list of main characters that goes to one's heart.
Here’s a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in Englund’s novel narrative very well, and these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you, like Englund’s men and women, are lost in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book, which he does not describe inappropriately as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, furious reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It’s less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather “a book about how it was.” It’s about “feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.”
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose membership, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flares up like the votive candles in a church, some come along, while others disappear.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating occupation war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and horror" wanders with expert views over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall bee baskets, a celebrated Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, cemeteries are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning of a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that smells like Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children, and hears cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or take the escape?
Who's coming at all?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Failing facts," notes Englund, "are imbued with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailor.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be frightening or gripping, but they are extremely vivid in Englunds of the in-detailed collection of small moments.
Many of them are dealing with lack and self-help.
In the story of a German schoolgirl he tells: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake eraser, paper ties, wooden buttons."
He talks more about replacement food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in hemp fat (and last served with a fake bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes that were covered with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for savagery and says of war: "You feel that despite everything this is what was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the dinner table or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in his hand, and so to do, as if not to be used as a barbeque and barbeque
On the contrary, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and no one will take notice of it or take care of it.
“When you distance yourself from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience,” he writes.
Instead, it’s as terrible as “a convicted man who was hanged in secret.”
Other observations are about the old Europe, which is falling apart, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in a suit that is slaughtering while sitting behind a desk."
Humans behave in an unpredictable way and there is as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who were actively trying to hook up with a prostitute with a sexual illness in order to escape the frontline service.
“The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in trade with gonococque ether, because soldiers were buying and smearing themselves on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital,” he writes.
“Those who were really desperate, caught him in the eye, which led to them being blind for the rest of their lives.”
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry becomes smooth and yet unobtrusive and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "uniquely unleashed uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are bringing them to fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly faked as Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "Nothing New in the West" rather than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I’ve ever read in a book.
I'm not giving it up anymore.
But it's as if with his book he'd snuck this page away with the main characters in front of his nose and set us on fire with a stick.
After an early mishap, a minutely planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing use helmets.
It had been decided for the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there were hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed, all others initially believed to be participating in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The events of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the desert and provided the house occupants with an enormous increase in public sympathies, were no longer allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a look at Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials stepped up the so-called chaos training – measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers – to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to get into the park came "at the last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, which spoke for a declaration as "exercise."
“The few police officers who were involved in my knowledge didn’t know it was about Zuccotti Park,” said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was Zuccotti Park were the top officials of the resort."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then retreated when hundreds of protesters came together after they learned of these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in the operation from Tuesday, including deployment commands from across the city - hundreds of mobile officers, usually deployed in high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people enter and exit the park, almost like commuters, so 1 o'clock in the night is a good time to enter.
“It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people in the park is staying,” he said.
Rescue vehicles with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready for departure at the Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and the pre-recorded messages swirling from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When public officials entered the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply packed up their belongings and left the place.
Police said no tents would be set up until 1:45 a.m. to give the protesters time to pack their belongings and goods together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests be necessary in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said this had happened to their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from watching the police actions in the park, and they said the officers' behavior was very harsh.
Mr Browne said that TV cars on Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken photos.
When the police moved westwards through the great mess of personal belongings of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial turfs and bags of clothes, their employees followed the city cleaning, which lifted what had been left behind.
Some protesters, who refused to go, were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters approached the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp joined their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Disaster protection officials have been called in to cut them off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
The evacuation was completed after 75 minutes, police said.
Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests, he said, came because of “unfeeful conduct and resistance to arrest.”
The most prominent officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officer of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the crime department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly “did not lead the operation,” as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials waited on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortlandt Street, a road block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It was possible to observe how police from these locations extended the circle around Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officials, many of them carrying shields, were seen driving people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 a.m., a protester jumped south of Pine Street on the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters left the air from the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Union of caregivers will file a lawsuit against the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school administrators who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the layoffs due to their undue influence on the schools teaching poor students are not necessary and discriminatory.
The lawsuit is probably the last possibility that the union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to reverse dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other staff who were among the city’s worst paid employees and had lost their jobs in a chess move on October 7, described the union leader as a political revenge for having spent the last year with the city’s health care workers.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said at a city council hearing last month that the layoffs were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the city council shot back and told him that nothing in the budget specified that school aid workers would be fired.
City Council officials said they had and warned the Department of Education against a lawsuit, and on Wednesday there will be a press conference to formally announce the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the city’s Ministry of Education as defendants and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Justice Department, said the city was not facing the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on their individual allegations.
According to a lawsuit filed by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the city’s poorer neighborhoods to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more helpers because they were chronically underfunded.
She states that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and only a few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, lost and 46 assistants in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Determining the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed at Harlem Public School 36, where 68 percent of the students were living in poverty, the lawsuit states: "This is not a neighborhood attended by parents who can organize donations to accommodate budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and money was also lost when the city changed its method of calculation for extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" (German: translate) in the U.S. usually describes a teacher's shift from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were fired, not transferred," the lawsuit said.
Mission completes, Congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed for this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American meddling.
On Thursday, the Senate’s Committee on International Relations will decide a resolution that will be submitted to President John Kerry (Massachusetts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut) to Libya for the successful “rebellion” of the U.S. and the “Triben-Americans.”
“This resolution honors the brave people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country,” Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House debated the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove the role of the US military in NATO’s Libyan mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution approving the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe group of both parties and there was no vote.
However, on the same day, this law was passed in the Senate, and the House overruled a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission came into a kind of legislative feud—with a Congress that was willing enough to criticise Obama’s approach as part of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecisiveness of Congress was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell under Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations “congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation” and “praises the men and women of the U.S. military and its coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya and advocate for them.”
The resolution also reaffirms “the national interests of the United States in the successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy.”
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Committee, or will they split the legislators, as the June law did?
The last version comes against the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican on the committee.
Lugar’s spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every congressional term for Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area that is currently being voted on in the Senate or Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far unsuccessfully tried to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried to do so.
Goodlatte's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been submitted to this Congress and cover a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law has been submitted to both Congress and the Senate - others are only slightly different from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would “control federal spending.”
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients – especially novices among Republicans who want to polish up their resume – the opportunity to boast that they have “written” such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit on two presidential terms.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage among same-sex couples is just like a change that prohibits the burning of flags, an ever-repeating proposition.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states reject them.
As eager as the members propose changes, they are moving even faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, 77 such amendments were tabled by legislators. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace is fading compared to the early 1990s, when members regularly propose more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were also not much more successful than today’s ones.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Meeted, but not defeated," Giffords said in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man shot at her from a distance during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday evening. She sang alone to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that he wanted to return to her as he wanted to.
When she appeared with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she stood by words and needed help walking.
The broadcast showed the severe slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet that divided her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January assassination, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang – and described her recovery as “difficult”.
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied, "Very well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special, which was recorded shortly before the release of the couple's new book: "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special has been tracking Gifford's recovery since the January 8 attack.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, she is seen in the hospital bed, with her head barely shaved and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nick with a head.
A sock with the lip.
And then, their first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast." She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: You can see how the Congressman sings along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and to Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours daily on therapy, said she can’t remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he read Giffords' article in a daily newspaper on March 12 about the attack when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the attack.
The alleged shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, sits in a prison in Missouri and is forced to be treated medically while waiting for his trial.
“Many people have died,” said Giffords Sawyer.
"Heart, heart, heart."
In the course of his wife’s recovery, Kelly told Sawyer, “I was hit.”
"So, I'd say, 'Gabby, you weren't defeated,'" Kelly said.
You were just hit.
And you will endure it and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Soldiers are more likely to feel compassion than respect.
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
At one point, hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black smokers stood up and applauded.
“The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising campaign in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, who was observed, among other things, by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were introduced like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, it really wasn't.
The harsh conflicting impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the most remote, sometimes admired American public.
The troops are topped with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has its price, service members say.
The public is increasingly behaving as if they were suffering people in uniform.
“We were by no means a victim,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is highly sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger of the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations about compassion in silence and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would consider them with a sense of reverence, as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a “wrong, violent veteran is hiding under the surface,” said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over a high-ranking post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewers were asking subtly whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
“When you talk about your service, you have to hold back the negative impressions,” Cancian told his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military stems in part from the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Performances on the battlefield are rarely seen as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We as a nation no longer value military heroism as it was absolutely usual in World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a service member.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to tighten its grip on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men are charged with non-interference in a rape case before the military court.
If this is not the case, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant at week 11 when she was raped at night by a fellow soldier.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who carried a 12-pack of beer with her.
He asked if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went off," Lyman said.
But the Texan woman put aside her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, what, he's 19.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
“I wish I had listened to my gut feeling.”
A few minutes after they had gone to Lyman’s room, the man stepped behind her, pressed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officers are anxiously awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it will be decided whether a lawsuit they have filed against former Defense Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not committed widespread rape within the military and violated the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, filed by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but in the following months rose to 28: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, accused of abusing it, and accused the military
Burke says she's pursuing the top military leadership as the problem starts there.
“The military is hierarchical,” she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture retaliation of? The leadership."
Burke also said she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors since February, many of whom may be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by federal attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to dismiss the lawsuit.
The court’s files, which are present at Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries to which it has come in the armed forces.
Due to a 1950 Supreme Court law, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the military service of the plaintiffs," the document says.
The Department of Defense denies any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not admitted to service in combat, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers are increasingly playing important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
“It’s time for the military to be modernized,” Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more lawsuits besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, Veterans’ Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies over alleged promotion of a woman-friendly atmosphere.
Independently, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America collects a lawsuit against the military, which focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that the rape victims received in order to release them from service - a common practice according to network activists such as Anu Bhagwati's Human Service.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration (i.e., War Veterans’ Administration), in which she alleged her discriminatory practices in her handling of performance claims for people who claim to have been sexually abused in service.
Nine laws were introduced independently of each other by a mix of senators and representatives of both parties to Congress, which offer a number of clues.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (i.e. Office for Prevention and Reporting of Sexual Abuse) of the Ministry of Defense, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported.
However, most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure takes into account approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases to which it comes every year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines the rates of prosecution: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases recorded in the military came to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman’s case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole range of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape kit and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge during this hearing, and she was asked about the sex she had had before the attack with her boyfriend.
Six people said they were character-producers on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually released.
“I still remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought the cries were going to be used, and I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember when I came out again, I said to my commander, 'That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure.'
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was unfairly fired, so she received no support whatsoever.
Whether the lawsuit that Lyman and the other plaintiffs filed is progressing is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I have always been a critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military hangs back a decade, because they do not possess the same incentive and the same deterrence that a liability brings with them.
He adds, "The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow her path, Burke, the plaintiff’s lawyer, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this regard until there is reform,” she says.
Or until we die, whatever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who has confessed to having committed suicide in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is by no means alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time before his attack on his computer, shaming with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It’s easy – you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We have found that it was not difficult to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report by the British think tank DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s hiding of personal data is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett that researchers simply need to use the site’s advertising tool to accurately determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy – as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then visited them with Adds, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the Adds users invited users to a survey in which, according to their educational status, their attitude towards violence and their savings, were spared.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to poll more than 10,000 supporters from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without even having to leave their office once.
“It’s a fairly new research method,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online supporters of right-wing extremist groups are mostly young, male, and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, “those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens.”
DEMO’s work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to societal trends such as in "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, Facebook’s “Data Supernova” is generating a research boom that has increased the number of scientific works named after this page in the title by almost 800 percent over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that through this site you can study people that you usually do not reach with their clipboard on the road.
"If you tried to question people of the British National Party earlier, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have granted them access," Bartlett said.
“With Facebook, all of this falls away – you go straight to them.”
Others say that the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full-blown sound on Facebook were significantly more likely to drink problem drinks than students who were silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that equivalent students, such as housing advisors, monitor the page and help a student when they post too many status updates.
“You can’t solve a problem if you don’t recognize it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author and director of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
“We have found a way to identify endangered children who would not otherwise have been found.”
Facebook is also constantly tapping into the data of its own population.
The site’s data team has created statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, election participation in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Happiness Index (primarily using data that only Facebook has access to – Masters of Digital Freedom knows for a long time that the site should make its big data pit for others to research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want to or not. In order to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site allows you to display your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know anything about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
“I don’t think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he researched the public pages of students on Facebook.
“As far as she was concerned, it was just about her and her friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile and in posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research needs to take care of social – and every lot of social life still takes place offline.”
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears in public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who has endured two amok attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because of this, multiculturalism is supported."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who gave a pre-written speech, permission to address his victims’ relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the Breivik police to keep him in custody for another 12 weeks, he said he had no access to the media for four weeks, and that the authorities would monitor all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims took part in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he was behind the castle and the bar.
Everyone took part in the goal that everything was going to be on a road closure.
“I thought he looked cold and inhuman,” a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I've seen and heard the suspects."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and acted calmly and professionally throughout the hearing, looking into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he entered and left the building again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre remark that he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
Some may like that the attacks of July 22 apparently were the work of an individual extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the sadness and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," the victim's family said.
“It would be so much easier if he did.”
7 Lessons from an Interview with the Late Steve Jobs Showed at a Theater This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, raising the technical genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find most revealing in the recently rediscovered job interview, which was dusted this week before special film screenings in key markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and self-appointed hippie, but he was also an acribic organizer who worked eagerly on diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffer from "a disease of thinking", "that a really great idea makes up a huge 90 percent of the work." [emphasis added]
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Professional Diodes" about the breakup of the personal computer, and he sat with jobs for more than an hour, in which they held one of the rare, detailed conversations.
By this time it had been more than 10 years since jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard at his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley's interview was used in specialist diodes, he says that the interview's copy templates were missing from the delivery.
Only after Job’s death was a full VHS copy discovered in the director’s garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theater this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to detest extensive interviews, Jobs here appears surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
During the course of the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to life when he seemingly impatiently responds to Cringely's questions and prompts him to deal more quickly with topics or side effects of greater importance.
Prior to the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone recording, the Lost Interview somehow seems unbelievably far-sighted when Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing right or wrong in his opinion and represents his own vision of the future of the computer.
It’s one thing to read posthumous appreciations of Jobs’ career, but seeing Jobs here as the eager dreamer who is on the jump to greatness is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Soon after he had done all of this, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"During all the years in business, I always ask, "Why do you do things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing. No one in the store really thinks about things in depth.
I've found that.
Jobs continues his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Astonished by how costs were recorded - usually starting with "standard costs", which were denominated on mere guesses and then adjusted with "distinction" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined to the minimum.
How the Pope was vilified:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could sneak into the phone company and conduct remote conversations for free.
Much has already been written about the device, but Jobs’ enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-authorization is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while looping through as many satellites as possible.
“We sent things half a dozen times around the globe, and when you rolled into the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door,” Jobs said.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn’t know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don’t think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs goes on to tell of a glorious strike that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they wanted to call in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and talk to the Pope while they were able to imitate Henry Kissinger as well.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with the technique (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
“It had a remarkable impact on me, it was the only company I had seen in my life and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees.”
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever built.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunschweig tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang onto this machine and write programs for them.
How to Improve Innovations:
Many times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he installed some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had with developing a computer mouse:
"I remember striking arguments... They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15. That was incredibly credible.
About large companies that rely on:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs envisioned the ways in which so many industrial giants with their visions ran into stilts and lost control of their stocks.
“Let’s say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you’re making a better copywriter or printer, right?”
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [they are such people] who ultimately run the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is needed by people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products, eradicated - craft art.
This happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
One could have been ten times bigger, one could have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
You have won the victory.
About Innovation as an Art Form:
“It’s a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about their subtleties.
You have to make adjustments, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
In the end, it goes beyond taste, it goes beyond trying to mess up with the best thing people have created, and then trying to bring these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists are copying, great artists are stealing.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
Had it not been for the computer industry, they would have created fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws, as court adopts case
On the day the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to listen to a challenge to President Obama’s health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner where the lawyer was arrested.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit brought by 26 states against the far-reaching health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that became the headline for conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, the result of which is likely to be in full swing in the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full effect at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the law is to tip, will probably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the Federalist Society’s annual dinner, an age-old group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company sponsoring the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which opposes the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had consulted on the case at a Washington hotel.
Service included Mitch McConnell, the head of the Republican faction in the Senate and a declared opponent of health reform.
The dinner guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in benefit events near law and other organizations, where the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms involved in the case as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in this to alert moral and government activists.
“This astonishing violation of morals and contrary to the Code punishes the complaints of some judges for lying, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined during a charity event with lawyers with floating proceedings in court."
Your appearance and support of a fundraising campaign for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and is not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would mix court affairs too easily with groups that can be guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a U.S. attorney general under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits came to court in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from the hearing of the case because of bias, as she was too much engaged in defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan doesn't have any facilities to do this.
Boeing pulls record order of $18 trillion to land
Emirates has ordered 50 twin-engine aircraft of the Boeing 777 type with an option for 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It’s really a rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it’s a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft totals a record $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is Boeing’s client: the Middle East, a growing goldmine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced on the weekend its largest ever commercial aircraft order, measured by the order value: 50 twin-engine Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
In addition, Boeing announced it at the Dubai Aviation Show in 2011, an option to buy 20 more aircraft that will increase the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, were ordered, which greatly improves the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
“This is absolutely positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, Morningstar’s stockbroker.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but rather an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders less than other airlines when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have a natural defense,” he said.
Emirates’ order confirms Boeing’s leading position in the large-scale aircraft market and helps keep Airbus’ competitors SAS in check, which is attacking the pre-power position with the A350.
Boeing’s victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the launch of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more confidence after customers had demanded a higher payload and reach.
Boeing shares rose 1.5 percent to $67.94.
Mexico's president's sister loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims to have supported drug dealer opponent Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race for governorship.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister apparently lost her application for the office of governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, won the race for governorship in the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the election process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... they have occupied polling booths, built roadblocks ... and mandated people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have barely beaten Claderon, who had led in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current incumbent governor, came in third place, a heavy defeat for the split and unhappy left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections to drug dealers and urges other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
The violence is still continuing.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have emerged out of fear of local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how rebellious the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will make us look bravely into the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is calling on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia’s economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based ADB, said the world’s two fastest-growing economies must do “everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that they are “passionately” looking at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources by Asia helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all in the same boat.”
“So everyone is helpful who can help Europe out of this crisis,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some degree, but it is not immune.”
“If China and India can help, then by all means.”
In recent months, the European Monetary Union has been in a serious debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy’s interest rates have risen dangerously and the prime ministers have retreated from both Italy and Greece.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe is scaring fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and has led to calls that leading emerging economies need to come together to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that mutual agreements – such as the purchase of EU bailout bonds, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) – would provide greater bargaining power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do everything in its power” to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from declining exports and drying out foreign capital flows.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We are facing great challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an assignment, because somewhere else we find work for our millions of young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no incentive to help the wealthy Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India aid for Europe, of which more than $800 million are living on a daily basis or even less.
"Someday they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend their holidays on the beach, and then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid employees in public service in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said the crises in the Eurozone will have “significant domino effects” across Asia.
The ADB’s forecast of economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011/now threatens “the risk of gradation” due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would have to create “crisis plans” to protect themselves from a downward trend and significant capital migration of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defense
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed up to Congress on Monday, warning that automatic budget cuts would unnoticeably weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon’s halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civilian pipelines.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts will be needed by $600 trillion or more if Congress can’t achieve a conclusion in spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry,” Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would lead to 23% overall cuts as well as a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such an unambiguous way, would make most of our ship and construction projects unimplementable - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts seriously harm," Panetta wrote to the Sena.
"We would also be forced to unwittingly separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to allow civilians with a reasonable probability of achieving the goal."
“These changes would destroy the faith of those who sustain our military and seriously damage our alertness.”
The cuts were finally met with the combat troops," Panetta said.
"While the wartime contingents in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in the settings and the attitude oversight that support the war."
“The salaries of the personnel would be cut, which would lead to late payments to wartime traders and the legal as well as political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of automatic cuts on the defense ministry.
“The consequences of a seizure by the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military force.”
“We are vehemently against this draconian act,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon, when they published Panetta’s letter.
“This is a result that we cannot live with, and it’s certainly not something that we should be pressured into.”
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta’s letter and the senators’ new warnings will increase pressure on a budget compromise or increase demands to remove the Pentagon from cuts remains to be expected.
Panetta has increasingly bluntly voiced the possible cuts, although he was able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows he faces tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister painted a dark picture of what could happen - a military with shells, but without cores.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squadron without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission,” Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
“It’s a power that lacks morals and alertness and is unable to accommodate it with potential opponents.”
"She's making one really angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts, and disasters, serious restrictions on our global deployment and engagement, leading to a ripple effect."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects of the deletion could fall victim to it, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighting vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If we stop the further development and testing of the F35, this would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but proponents say it is an important next step in re-equipment so that potential dangers can be banished by China and other adversaries.
How to Draw a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how suspicious and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is concerned with becoming the master of the allegations of sexual harassment on the part of several women, and both sides are considering each other's lies.
Penn State’s management is accused of meinoid disease, as reports have reportedly been held back after a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nicolas Sarkozy told U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shock countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner became a fool when he put into circulation denials, which were very quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violating campaign funding, which is related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that triggered President Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office regarding his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about swinging in school and at college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers have provided their students with the test answers so that they can do well even during their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and gossip are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies show, we lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
However, many of these lies are considered emergency ones.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or "discovering lies" is one that is important for every person to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as chess, in which the goal is to shout "Have you!", the debunking of a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities and researched extensively in the field of phology.
One result of the research is that most ancient myths have been revealed about lying.
Lies look one in the eye.
They don’t always stutter, stutter, blush, and stagger.
From this, however, one must not conclude that these liars are difficult to detect and detach.
An practiced liar can penetrate into the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the subtle facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years researching the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing field of abduction. And it is clear that the abduction of a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to cope with the responsibilities in our complex world, especially when it comes to impersonating or questioning the person.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people, raising their interest and mastering their own emotions, and they feel intuitively how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people are more likely to lie than introverted people, that men are more likely to "self-oriented" lies than women, whose lies are more "orient to others" - usually they want to "protect the feelings of others" - that married people are less likely to lie to their partners, and that married people are less likely to lie to them.
We also know that when one person was exposed as an offender, others feel less guilty about lying to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the later assessment of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of her test person.
You should know better when someone is usually constantly tripping with the foot, so they don’t accuse him of wrong when he tripping with the foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to the accumulations of noticeable verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these seizures as alarm bells that scream, not as evidence of a hideout.
People who deceive may become stale when they try to remember their story. Maybe their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the attitude conversation", this deep, relaxing exhalation of all breaths.
Questioners often erroneously signal that an attitude conversation is over, only to keep an eye out after this relaxation after the attitude conversation.
Also, pay attention to the language of your test person.
Scott Peterson's ouster is famous for using the past form when he claimed his dead wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceiving people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question as a whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... after the best knowledge and conscience."
As a result, the response is perceived rather than actual, which often makes the alarm bells scream.
There is no magic way to hide lies, but you can learn skills that make it possible to hide.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can become the victim of scammers less often, both in private and professional life.
Controversial Plan of an Oil Pipeline Will Be Reworked After Delayed U.S. Consent
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which angered the unions and at the same time reassured environmentalists, this is what the pipeline-building companies are trying to re-plan the project so that you can return to normal.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the State Department last week that a decision on a federal permit for the project would be overturned until the new possible course was reviewed that would affect the Sandhills area in Nebraska, as well as the Ogallala aquifer, a major underwater supply.
“This is a real step forward,” Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review, which has been ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, may postpone a decision until 2013, following next year’s elections, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said in a written statement last week that the decision was a task of the foreign ministry and said he supported it.
The 1700-mile pipeline was linked Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
For this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them, because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska’s lawmakers, who are against the plan, are weighing down laws to force a retreat from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy says that the ministry’s chief auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s 2008 advisor, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle charged with allegedly forcing a toddler out of fear of collapsing
A New York family claims that the disco-diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had been hit by a drug addiction that scared her little daughter so much that she gave in to fear.
The tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disturbance" and "increased fear of strangers," her family told the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergartener, and Genevieve wanted to break up for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went with her luggage and Genevieve on her arm into the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter down for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind me and said, 'You know what your daughter is doing right now?' I said, 'Yes,' and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman angrily.
“She said in an aggressive tone: ‘You shouldn’t put your daughter near the door,’” said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you say or think.'"
She got angry and started to sneeze - she used the F word and the A word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started boiling water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’” the child’s mother said.
LaBelle stumbled upon the mother who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be restrained from her escort and pulled into a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby cried so much that it had to surrender, she said.
The LaBelle family later apologized in writing, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for an opinion.
The lawsuit is for an unspecified damages, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he would not charge a fee and the family plans to donate the money they receive to the child cancer charity.
“We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior,” Davis said.
"This type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is placed in front of a kindergartener on the day an 18-month-old baby is wearing on her arm."
Climate Difficulties Stop the Economy
In the first year in which Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez is in government, unemployment and black labor rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloas. It is the first year in which Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, who called himself the initiator of the change and expressed great hopes regarding economic growth, is important to the government. However, as a result of the climatic difficulties, the economy cannot be a part of growth.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses in millions of tonnes in agriculture, but also placed tight limits on the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter of the year.
According to a report issued by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustainable (i.e. the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the frost, 582,000 hectares of farmland were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were fully harvested and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially harvested.
The decline in economic activity in the Mexican state has led to a steady increase in unemployment in September. The Instituto Nacional de Estad<0xC3><0xAD>stica y Geograf<0xC3><0xAD>a observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, because from January to March the population of Sinaloas had 5,053 jobs and 4,53% employment.
Lower Liquidity
Economic scientist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences at the University of Aut<0xC3><0xB3>noma (UAS), commented that public institutions’ policies indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, liquidity losses on the market as a result of the cuts in funds through legislation that has been passed to combat money laundering in Congress are too much for those who are not willing to pay for it.
The migration halted
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined. This is due on the one hand to the problems of entry and on the other because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here and look for work, which causes unemployment to rise".
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more difficult, given the high proportion of black labour, which according to INEGI includes 60.38 percent of the country's workers who work without paying into the social insurance funds.
Unemployment and black labor are the lowest wages in all of Mexico, according to statistics from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institution) and the Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a del Trabajo y Previsi<0xC3><0xB3>n Social (Government Authority for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5,352 pesos as of September; that is much less than the national average of 7,375 pesos.
Decrease in ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and growing unemployment, in 2011 the largest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is recorded. According to the Secretariat of Economy (State Economic Authority), the ADI was in January to June 630 597 dollars, a decrease of 14.3 per cent, compared to a decrease of 14.3 per cent.
For its part, the Secretariat de Desarrollo Econ<0xC3><0xB3>mico del Gobierno (Government Authority for Economic Development) recorded a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debts
In the face of the economic crisis, in July, the state government applied to the National Congress for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos, which should be invested in the 18 municipalities to reactivate the economy in infrastructure projects. The National Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but until November no positive effects on the economy could be identified.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdé’s first year of government made it clear that he was incapable of government.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the C<0xC3><0xA1>mara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformaci<0xC3><0xB3>n (National Chamber of Processing Industry in Mexico), said that no efforts had been made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the various sectors, including the national government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very demanding this year. It has to be worked hard to recover the lost land this year and in 2012 we have to make a double effort. The efforts of all, and especially the progress of the already well-adjusted government team have not been adequately addressed," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez stated that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made economic development of the country more difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the most important impacts is a slowing economy that is not moving enough to create an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services.
Re-define call
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Patronal de la Rep<0xC3><0xBA>blica Mexicana (Entrepreneurial Association of Mexico) in Sinaloa, explained that the state must be engaged in more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The Coparmex chairman stressed how important it is to develop a future perspective that steers the government’s efforts on better track.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress in the government.
"There are areas where you can say that the government has acted more comprehensively, what I can say is that it has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
At five years in prison and 100 daily sentences, a resident of Navolato was convicted of possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The attorney general of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the property of marijuana intended for trade.
According to Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican soldiers on 7 June 2010 in the surveillance of the Cipriano Valdez road in front of guard post No. 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack, in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the seized goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the fine is still in the execution facility.
Debts for construction work
The Habitat, Rescue de Espacios P<0xC3><0xBA>blicos and 3x1 social buildings for migrants are at risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda.
The head of the city’s social development authority said that although the construction programs have already advanced, they are now in danger, as the state government has not paid the funds it is owed, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said that the total investment in these three programs amounts to almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state, and so far only the Federaci<0xC3><0xB3>n and the municipality had contributed to the construction work, which is why a delay in the construction termination is expected.
“They have to contribute 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, they haven’t given us a penny, and that, even though they should have paid us a part in July,” he said. “To not be too late, we’ve already started construction, and they’ve already progressed far, but we need the money.”
He pointed out that under the government of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla the state had not fulfilled its obligations, which is why the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its reign, which corresponds to the amount that the central government had to raise.
"We had already done so in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programs continued and this year we had to obtain the funds that the state had not applied to participate in these programs," he said.
Although the state authorities were obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance, , was asked to expedite the administrative work and pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
“Almost 12 million have to contribute, and although the year is coming to an end, they haven’t given us a penny.”
The court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The transition of analogs to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) showed the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential impeachment, and by virtue of which the switch from analog to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to contest the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, were of the opinion that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed his powers when he issued the legislative decree detailing the switch to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate, as it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court could decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality, so the law remains in force.
In the draft of the complaint prepared by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the legislative decree unconstitutional, since for the regulations relating to radio and television the Comisi<0xC3><0xB3>n Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications) would be referred to in Mexi.
The project was supported by Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the legislative decree. After accepting the complaints, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero no longer applied the legislative decree and instituted all activities for the establishment of the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project for which Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country's government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration with general rules.
"I also do not believe that doing so would affect the independence of the regulatory body," she also recalled that for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible, because the central government is responsible.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it results in a better use of the radio spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, she said, was a postponement of the exploitation of digitalisation, which is a decision in the public interest that not only has technical aspects, "because it encompasses economic, social, political and security aspects."
These issues, they stressed, "made the action of the whole system necessary, in accordance with the principle of economic management by the state they contained a group of features that put the constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already implemented the digital transformation, namely the government, although they had highly specialized facilities.
One cannot conclude that the government intervenes in the competences of Congress with the issuance of the contested legislative decree, because the laws passed by the legislature would be complied with,” she said.
The possibility of counting the number of votes in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of the individual counting of the ballots is a reality this year in the elections in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, because according to the data released by the Programa de Resultados Electoral Preliminarys (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governor’s elections is almost 27 percent, with a total of 879 votes out of 60.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just on 9 November, the constituency had a series of rules for harmonizing local regulations with the reforms of the states of Waa.
It should be remembered that Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n had not adapted neither his political constitution nor his electoral law nor his law on electoral justice to the reforms passed by Congress, so that these did not come into force during this round of elections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature and judged the representative of the state to vote on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and unlawful" as he did not have the right to "determine or veto" it.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal explained in an interview that thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, the possibility now exists that the local electoral authority can partially or completely count the ballot.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be counted in part. The results in the minutes do not match; the record of the counting and calculation of votes is not presently available or is not owned by the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the fully filled ballots can be made when there is a difference between the alleged winner and the one in second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided at the beginning of the session is an explicit request of the party-bz.
The counting of votes may also take place in their entirety if, after the completion of the regular calculation, it is determined that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate is the candidate.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where according to PREP the difference between first and second place is almost 0.16%, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés took place this Sunday evening on Saltillo, his birthplace, and on Monday the death scene and a mass of deaths took place.
According to family members, the last will of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After a tribute, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the others who were killed in the crash, returned to the capital of Coahuila, where they took part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At 12 noon, the ash of the lieutenant colonel landed on the Trauerhalle, located on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family and friends came from.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, which was created by his former students from the technical academy and his American football team, Felipe Bacio, during his preparation for the academy.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and that his ashes would spread over the Zapalinamé mountain, which he had always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the Lieutenant Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to join the Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n Air Force School, Jalisco.
Some couldn't catch it because they thought it would even slow him down on a truck, yet he always sought to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembered him as a good man. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n to graduate his family member, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
One last farewell
In 1985, under the leadership of Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, the Lieutenant General of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was awarded the honour of the Mexican people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military, the Mexican Air Force, the schoolmaster and the schoolmaster.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew in crashed, in which Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority were sitting.
At 6.05 p.m., the captured remains of Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, his family members, his aunts, his aunts, his uncles, and his uncles.
The abandoned body was found on a property on Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military officials presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same village in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by gunshots in different parts of the body and a mercy shot in an abandoned finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The event had taken place at the kilometer point 1.5 of the highway from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several transients saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall rose wide.
When they looked into the house, they found about three meters further inside the bodies of three people, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow t-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another, dressed in a white top.
Almost a meter away was the body of another person with red t-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on their stomachs.
According to the information received on site, the three people must have been murdered in another place, as no cartridge sleeves were found.
On the wall of the country house there are inscriptions that write one organized gang of criminals to another, in addition, several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defence) introduced 11 people, including a minor who was part of a criminal gang, who was mainly active in the town of Cadereyta, and who are being transported with kidnappings, murder, halconeo (human-hunting) and secret burials.
According to public information, on November 11, eight people were arrested in the Los Alveros settlement and one prisoner was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured, and the detainees confirmed to be members of the Los Zetas criminal group.
On November 12, at 6 a.m., soldiers found a car without a number sign with two occupants on their patrol in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13, at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the community of La Frauda, who tried to seize the escape at the sight of the military.
They will be engaged in secret raids in the places of General Ter<0xC3><0xA1>n, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government, which is expected to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government, which is expected to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that the Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm the formation of the government.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said he would present the President with the results of talks with the political parties on government formation.
“I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country’s ability to cope with these difficult times,” the former EU Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but from his comments it is clear that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well-lit," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt to an intolerable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a hard-earned austerity package that has been demanded by Euro-politicians to regain confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti’s fast-moving market was further compounded by the fluctuating market situation in which Italian government bonds were taxed at 7% interest for 10 years, which was in line with the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industrial association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government by all means."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to come out of this emergency.
Montis’ chances of success were significantly increased with the support of PDL party Silvio Berlusconi, who had to step down as a result of the crisis on Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are intended to produce good results,” said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Mid-Right Party.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a government consisting mostly of technocrats, which is currently forming Monti.
Support from Parliament
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Resisting his efforts or delaying the reforms could once again cause a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is practicing with his hint that a failure of Montis is a disaster, also under pressure.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations as well as with youth and women’s organisations.
The session is scheduled to be concluded on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who in response to the crisis has initiated an extremely rapid change of government.
After a brief pause towards the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would step down, as a result of uncertainty over the new prime minister’s success, the costs of Italian government bonds have again reached critical limits.
A bailout of Italy with a state debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said his government would have to wait until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, rather than preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in view of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the inclusion of people from political life.
Spaniards have more opportunities to play than the Ticos
Of the 22 players from Spain, 10 have more than 50 international games on the table.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of 22 players has 50 games left.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the friendly game, which will take place today at 15:05 at the San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one on FIFA’s monthly rankings, can look back on a considerable number of Class A selections, the three-color team only has defensive player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached that number last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (league and cup championships) as well as high-level European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Fury comes with complicated elimination games at the Eurocup and the World Cup.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international matches as part of the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA rankings at the very bottom.
We will see how the Spanish team pulls their last record: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who reached a par with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta last Saturday against England (Defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play against the three-color team today and Spain set a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, player of the Barcelona football club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and the midfielder of Schalke, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
The number one hundred is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side striker J<0xC3><0xBA>nior D<0xC3><0xAD>az with 48 games and the striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there, only five came to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The ones with the fewest games.
Less than 30 games have been played in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
From the sides of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even close to the 20th century.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var has only one in Costa Rica and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not made their debut yet.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot nine more goals, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet embarked Costa Rica on its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
“Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true.”
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament says the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures them that a dream will come true when they play in Costa Rica.
This was stated by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day they will perform at the National Stadium starting at 7.30 pm together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You can read an excerpt from the conversation whose full transcript can be found in the online edition of La Naci<0xC3><0xB3>n.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just the second time we’ve played in South and Central America, and so far it’s been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once for a holiday. It's such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I'm asking you this because the fans of the band are completely committed, and you're experiencing the days before the concert most intensively.
What do you think of your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
We took almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry to have taken so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn’t that a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we’ve done in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle. For that, Costa Rica belongs to the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the excellent areas to surf. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a view of the tour, you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there, we don’t set any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You will never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs, and everyone likes a different song, so the decision we’re going to play in each one is not easy.
If we record two or three songs that we have not played in the repertoire for a long time, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs, otherwise they might be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour, you celebrate your twenty-year history.
If you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don’t think any of us ever imagined playing in a great rock band, even for over 20 years, which seems like a dream.
We also continue to rely on these blessings and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We love and are excited to bring out music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth hour of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then a band emerges from a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We’re still looking forward to being friends with them all and it’s our honor to be part of this upcoming Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual for a band like yours to have stayed with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands can survive.
First of all, I think we all appreciate being alive and also taking care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical ways have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One is familiar with the other and his music, and we couldn't do any better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy, but on the other hand, thanks to your success, you have always been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you think that people came because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what brought it to life, without eating it being a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and in the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years that never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have used it for so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us. When I hear a song or photos, I think of what it was like to be a great person Andy and how he used to make me laugh, always making fun.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. That’s why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This will be exciting.
Why do you change the text of Yellow Ledbetter every time you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who were you influenced by as a bassist?
Of so many+
Among the first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fashion appearance?
I don't think we all feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I like the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone else who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find it great, because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney now make better music than ever.
In the beginning her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
That’s interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit easy, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have some positives in themselves.
Both of them came to me with tears when I heard Ed playing them, they're very dark songs.
I believe that when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life – for example, when you lose a family member or a friend – that influences your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embody that for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori came back to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his GP informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years in prison for human rights violations during his tenure (1990-2000), has several illnesses, including tongue cancer, which has been operated and controlled four times.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congressman and his personal physician, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neopl<0xC3><0xA1>sicas hospital to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but he did not wish to do so because he considered him innocent.
He was operated on four times on tongue cancer and lost 18 kilos of weight. Other diseases include severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and bleeding problems in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been in detention since September 2007 at the Direcci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la polic<0xC3><0xAD>a.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation led by Uruguay’s President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs will start their visit from Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n next Wednesday, which, according to the Uruguayan president, will be the culmination of his busy schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the Uruguayan collective living in Mexico.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the South American country's presidential office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is looking for Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s support regarding the incident with France when the French head of government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still appear to be tax havens from the international community, which Uruguay rejected and made a request to its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and industrial countries, and since January this year there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has been trying to speed up the implementation of agreements on the exchange of tax information to be removed from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)'s "gray list" of countries that have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
At the business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The cord-bearing installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil bowser, but never before in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the girl's love in stereo technology.
The game, which is coming to the stores all over the world this month, has been tailored from the start to the features of the portable console Nintendo 3DS, with which it can be played three-dimensionally without a special glasses.
“Mario is the figure who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, head of the Nintendo-specialized press in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first Nintendo video game to be developed for this console from the beginning", because until now successful articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
Nintendo’s spokesperson stressed that although it is three-dimensional, “Super Mario 3D Land” is an “expensive” video game that allows for a fast, fluid game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "easy" to catch the less shy users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" over the different levels of play, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. In order to overcome the obstacles without being victims of the "optical effects", however, it must always be played three-dimensionally.
This trip to the three-dimensional world of Super Marios also means the return of the character to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo entices fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the latest releases: The cordless installer has to overcome dangerous spiked platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news on the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom to ship Portillos to the United States
Guatemalan President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he would take delivery of the former governor Alfonso Portillo, so that he would be responsible in the United States for the $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
Thus, the process ends with the U.S. request for the delivery of Portillo, so that it can be brought to court there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of judiciary and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that he had not interfered in court decisions during his government and had made all the extradition requests from which he had been notified.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n is extradited for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom’s action is an act of government that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former President (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered if its legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and its human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the subjugation of 120 million Quetzals in the Ministry of Defense during his reign, which preceded the extradition process, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people threatened with social exclusion
The organization was created to avoid the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the social welfare organization Trinijove have led to important results: In this quarter century, 6,000 young people, threatened by social exclusion, were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are over one hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event was held in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, where more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low educational status, without work, with drug problems that were threatened by the risk of marginality.
At yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu, numerous managers of institutions and institutions who have worked with the association for these 25 years participated.
The participation of political representatives from different directions in election campaigning periods proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and former Mayor and current left-green city council member Ricardo Goma took part in the celebrations.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was brought to life in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated. But he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives people hope in difficulties.
“The economic crisis is nothing new for the club and the work it does,” he said.
Occupied house, in which huge parties were held, was cleared
The owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes street No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve occupants of the house left the building yesterday afternoon to have done without resistance.
All points out that the alpine dreams of the neighbors of House No. 51 on Balmes Street have come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday afternoon voluntarily the building, which they had kept illegally occupied, and in which they had organized huge parties that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The evacuation took place on a judicial order without police intervention.
After the clearance, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the house manager confirmed.
The occupants, who had occupied 11 of the building's 13 apartments - the rest of which were inhabited - took with them the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. In addition, they had painted the walls and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had fallen by 80% since the beginning of the house occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the house-owners made their unfair competition because they sold the drinks for three euros, while these in the discotheque cost 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had been shown by the neighbors due to restlessness, while according to their statement the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the occupants of the house, and especially from the guests of the parties who were organized there, and who, according to the statements of the more and more angry neighbors, were always angry.
The manager of the discotheque stated that the harassment was so great that she agreed with the owner of the building that she did not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) also confirmed that they have received more complaints from the neighbors in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had asked last week to immediately clear the building and get the problems of civic coexistence as well as the downfall of the neighbourhood in the grip.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in recent months the house occupants had moved into all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against the social actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3.30 p.m., police approached the street of Montral No. 35, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched as four people tried to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects have agreed to the tender, apart from the disputes over the fees.
The municipal tender for the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-defunct Corporaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its pamphlet on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers to New York’s Central Park.
With the collapse of the CMB in 1987, the park became in the eyes of many again to the upper border of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not extend in the north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and downwards (seas).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
As an example, the Central Park no longer served as a model, but Yellowstone with wild boar in the role of Yogi bear.
So far, when the city issued a huge tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either this is the case, or someone has plans to open doors to the country.
The question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
The tender is not only from an organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring topic that two members of this old caste, who meet in the elevator, can use.
And it is precisely this fact that offers the fabric for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The offer is appropriate.
For Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n "it is necessary", after the attack on the coast to talk about the "front of the mountain", to the extent that the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which is about the green apples, has not been carried out.
"One should assume from the principle that Barcelona is the largest park on the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Doors of Collserola" bears a "lexical trap": one must not "imagine them as accesses to a park, but as a limitation of areas on which to trade."
Modol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with urban experience, regards the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that poses "some dangers" in itself.
Dangers due to the "uncertainty that brings the design of a public space today" according to the experiences of the 1980s that had their "swan song" in the area of the forum.
The first concern is to limit ourselves to what can be built.
"Limiting something always means setting the next step", i.e. exceeding it.
“You have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [in relation to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster.”
Modol, who is closer to the question, means simplified, the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not “touch the deaf ear”, although he is grateful to the city administration for giving his board the opportunity to participate in this project “from the first moment”.
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city of guidance letter, which allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" about whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams brought to life ("should only be the right thing to do," he says).
Bayona points out that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, as the tender conditions lack a global view of Collserola: "There were 16 contests in cross-section", he says, "on the axis of the mountains-sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective in the field."
This, at least in his case, led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next door.
In his opinion, the city should necessarily guarantee that the strip is equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, resulting in a soft transition between the city and the green zones.
Casino forgives Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the Casino Red’s authorized representative freed the mayor of Monterrey’s brother from the trial being conducted against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal is released after the casino’s attorney Red has handed him over to the district’s Second Criminal Court, which is leading the trial against the mayor’s brother for extortion.
Following the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s is seen, allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration would approve the secret operation of the gambling house.
According to the criminal record, the prosecutor’s office opened a criminal case against the brother of the Panist mayor, who was arrested on September 2 for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He stayed at the place for 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs had dismissed the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta prison because he allegedly bribed the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. However, he only stayed for a few hours in the Central Security Forces, as he presented murder threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court proceedings as an inmate of the city prison of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was handed over by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, a warrant of arrest, which stated that after the nearly two months of investigation, there is sufficient evidence to allow Jonas to plead guilty for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the gambling house.
On Monday, Casino Red’s deputy, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor’s brother, to be released for the next few hours.
During the hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico, who was assigned to the court, asked Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez whether the latter had repaired the damage and which of the owner of the competition house had pronounced his pardon, but the lawyer retained the name.
According to the case 197/2011, Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal is free to speak. Also in the following, no objections can be filed against the trial, and no compensation is required.
After hearing the Commissioner of the Competition at 3:50 p.m., Larrazabal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n was immediately set free.
The court secretary, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, went to the city prison of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza to inform Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s that he had been acquitted and his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the court order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come gives details about the plane crash that killed government secretary Francisco Blake and seven other people.
The Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation into the accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people were killed may indicate that the helicopter is a shotgun with all its unscathed shells.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the launch that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wings had contact with trees at 25 meters altitude, with the helicopter losing its hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also stated that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, which is why he met all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the machine had come down.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the surcharge concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has an inclination of 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently, it is paramount to get the results of the examination as soon as possible, however, these may take several months, perhaps even a year.
Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, General Director of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidential had flown at a speed of travel and the aircraft had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the crash."
During a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Vision flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew must have had sufficient vision during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start. During the onward flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexican state, some deep-hanging clouds rose.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that because of the clouds, the team had chosen a lower area with better views towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Point of impact:
The impact coordinates and the last radar record of the helicopter are in agreement. There may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or deviation from the flight route before the impact.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter was struck from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of scattered aircraft debris suggests that the helicopter was hit on the ground with its unscathed structure.
No signs of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer at the accident site do not allow fire or explosion to be closed.
The last results of the study indicate several ground contacts.
On-site surveys found aircraft parts at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level and the terrain is shallow and has an inclination of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to have broken.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a thorough search on an area that went beyond the locked area at the crash site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, reinforcing the assumption that the unscathed aircraft structure had been struck against the ground.
MSS announces research protocol to find the gene for obesity
The Social Insurance Institution of Mexico is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institution of Mexico) announced that it is conducting a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth", with which the genetic markers are found in association with overweight.
Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, head of the Unit de Investigaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Médica en Bioqu<0xC3><0xAD>mica (Department of Medical Research, Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, declared that an interdisciplinary team, consisting of physicians, nurses and nurses, was formed.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud P<0xC3><0xBA>blica (INSP) and the Centro de Investigaci<0xC3><0xB3>n y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the sports venues of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are conducted every Saturday from 8.00 am.
He stressed that the investigation on the Cuauhtémoc Sports Ground (in the western part of the state of México) began and has been ongoing on the sports grounds of Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt (in the eastern part of the state of México) since 8 October.
When the target of 500 to 600 investigators is reached, the study will continue on the sports field of Independencia (south of the capital district) and on the one of Morelos (north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study is to get to know the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the World Diabetes Day, he stated that it will be sought that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 years should fill out nutrition-related questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of the disease to control risk factors that may result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He also stated that on the aforementioned Saturdays, the subjects were measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure controlled, and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (trying to identify germs related to feces).
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez stressed that this study would be conducted on the occasion of the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain of young people.
“The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in almost six years the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent, and overweight was also increased dramatically,” said the IMSS specialist.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that a Mexican is on average 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity is expressed in the inability to burn out the excess energy (calories) taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the study participants consisted in a comprehensive study of the children, in which it would be determined whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors explaining to the parents all the results of the measurement and proposing to them lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three basic factors that are responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, i.e. lack of movement in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport, rather than walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) along with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents impact holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico UNAM develops modified asphalt with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs are taken care of or taken care of by the road cover, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200,000 impact holes if the rainy season breaks out in the zone Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, the researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (University of Asbestos)
In his lecture "Technical impact holes", which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, which, however, do not have a greater mechanical resistance at both temperatures.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera believed that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of road surfaces and thus avoid the appearance of impact holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, of which one part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthenes.
The static behavior of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180<0xC2><0xB0> C., at 120<0xC2><0xB0> C. it is very densely liquid and almost solid at 50<0xC2><0xB0> C., while it becomes fragile at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in a day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," he said.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City mostly had a flexible road covering consisting of six layers of material, the last three of which contained asphalt.
Among the top layers is a layer of wear made of asphalt, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer has been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move on and forces are generated, this layer allows for a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," the chemical engineer said.
"Over the wear layer," he explained, "is designed a last layer, the so-called support layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. of sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tires, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they need to produce friction.
This road covering receives and distributes most of the forces, the support layer also needs an appropriate thickness and the material from which it consists must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other, important factors to consider, especially water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behavior of the wear layer.
When the terrain is wet, water enters the layer and only returns to a difficult position, causing all layers of the road surface to soften and, as a result, the appearance of impact holes.
When a blowhole occurs, "the cover layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only then damaged, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be in relation to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this impact will be avoided.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that a lot of research work had yet to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries, and with which the impact holes could be repaired easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected the fact that Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna did not receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle wins its 14th Miss World title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went empty at the awarding of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to be satisfied to stand on the winning podium, to put on a silver crown and the band she designates as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result of this night in Cartagena (1989), where Miss Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico (1989) took the crown and the cedar (1989), the department already comes to 14 Miss titles, and Melina joins the Legion of Women from Valle del Cauca, who had held the crown almost in their hands.
The big question that many people ask themselves today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the demise of a great favorite, who had shown at every performance that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing she had been chosen to be the queen of the police and to be the Major Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that also received with the beauty queens, the beauty queens, Kaliaana and Vargas.
The first factor that is considered crucial for the jury’s decision to appoint her to the First Miss is that she did not convince the answer to the question “Which book has influenced you the most and why?” posed to her by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe pretty much in literature, I think it's a way of civilizing myself, in the end, I believe that the book that most characterized my childhood, 'The Little Prince', is a rather profound book.
At the moment I am reading ‘guilty and pity’. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am just reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called ‘passion’.
A response that met with little reluctance, firstly because of the concept of ‘civilization’ and secondly because it had not specifically explained how each of its books had influenced it.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens, what has to happen.
And for all the people: please read a little <0x60>The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the favorite who had received all the awards in advance (Gastronomy competition Easter, public vote on the best hand-cut costume and Reina Madre), "didn't bother the other candidates of the king's, didn't bother the king's
And this was noticed in her first performance in a swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and in her two lifts at the crowning ceremony.
Although she was safe with both of them, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition does not, after all, become Queen."
In addition, Valle went to the end of the press out of the way - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the international jury’s meeting Lucy Doughty declared they were looking for a woman who was engaged in the social affairs of her country.
“Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling that she had already worked on projects before participating in the competition,” she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the dermis and fibrosis, which were noticed in her gastrointestinal tract, but this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for ‘natural beauty’ with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible eating habits.
The Queen’s coach, Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body that there would be, “but her problem with the fibrosis on the abdomen, which was honestly barely noticeable to me, pushed her score on the last day.”
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the journal Cromos believes that the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
“The operations are okay, but Valle didn’t know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay her."
Because of this award, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, after the appearance in the swimsuit, a cruel prediction was born, which should come true at night. It was whispered that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize so as not to let them get into the pleasure of the crown.
Whether that’s true or not, the fact is that Melina is now entering her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia on the nomination of the National Beauty Competition at one of the international competitions.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens, who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had escaped the crown.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4, a lophoscopist of the Investigation Unit of the Prosecutor's Office (CTI) from Cali, as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia) by comparing "Alfonso Cano"
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliasar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez had a readiness service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigation proceedings for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in communities of Choc<0xC3><0xB3>, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000 he settled in Valle over and after completing the necessary courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin exposed to friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliasar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night, he flew by helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one of them could be that of the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he should take the ten-finger print of Guillermo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n S<0xC3><0xA1>enz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the investigator, he was unable to identify him because of his physical appearance, because it resembled the images he had seen in the mass media, not at all.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
Fingerprints don’t lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a plant cell and a flashlight, Eleazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had seen correctly: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
Searching for traces
For a dactyloscope from the Sis<0xC3><0xAD>n in Cali, the appreciation given by President Juan Manuel Santos Elias Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez at a press conference on the use of "cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in solving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many criminals file false IDs or they don’t have one.
We take off their fingerprints and search for them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house during a robbery, because the thief had rested right there with his hand when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case, we were able to take the print of the entire hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts,” he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or charged.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by snap bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be a suspect, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this is not guaranteed to be the killer, it is still related to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscope specialist explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
When they appear, a plant cell or band is used to carry.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the personal office.
“The problem is that there are still a lot of Colombians without IDs,” said the expert from the CTI.
He said not everything is as it would be in the SCI TV series.
Just as not everything that glitters is gold, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
However, it can still be used if a corresponding comparison is made.
The 'Emporters' Urge the Authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded in tents on Zuccotti Square.
A large part followed the room command and changed its location to a nearby park.
Members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement on Tuesday urged the New York authorities to re-enter the Manhattan Square with a court order after they had been cleared from the square in the morning and had tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Zuccotti square, on which they wanted to gain access with a court order that allowed the "Empers" to re-enter the tent at this point, while another part of the movement kept coming to the square and moved to the city and occupied a park.
“Our idea is that if the court doesn’t allow us to camp on the square, we’ll find ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, one of the spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray argued that the response of the “importers” to the evacuation of her tent camp, which had been arranged directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came before the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the violent evacuation of the square and the demonstrators.
In addition, the "Emports" occupied a new park located at the intersection of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but then the police came in and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray could not give exact figures, and he assured the news agency Efe that he had seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that hundreds of people had arrived at the site, where an order of religious leaders had also been issued as a sign of their support for members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti square (an area in private property) remains closed pending a court hearing, which is still scheduled for this Tuesday, and in which the legality of the clearance held in the morning gray is to be analysed.
Some of the protesters driven by the square carried photocopies of this court order with them and distributed them. They even gave them to some police officers guarding the square, resulting in "some small clashes", as Bray reported, who had indicated, some police officers had beaten protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from clearing members of Occupy Wall Street from the square as well as the application of "laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg makes it clear to the press that, due to this court order, the reopening of the site for public transport and protesters has been cancelled, and the protesters pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to re-enter the site with tents and sleeping bags.
The mayor personally defended the evacuation of the Zuccotti square in the morning, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and the decision was made because the protesters "violated the law."
Bloomberg stated that he had given the order to clear the square because it had “turned into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people” because “some businesses would have received threats” and “some businesses would have received threats” and “some businesses would have been left at home.”
“The eviction in the morning was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not protecting the interests of North American workers,” the spokesman for the movement added, accusing the mayor of “not respecting freedom of the press.”
Occupy Wall Street officials said they are thinking of organizing “big actions” for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been taking since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will perform on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Canadian television Christmas show.
The private television channel CTV today announced that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will perform on December 1 in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will bring to life a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson - who also appeared for the Internet distribution of a self-portraits porn in which she, along with her former husband, the drummer of "M<0xC3><0xB6>tley Cr<0xC3><0xBC>e", Tommy Lee - appears as the Virgin Mary with a doll in the womb, the Jesus portrays.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, recently worked as a moderator on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" broadcast as Jesus Child.
CTV’s Christmas program not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far away from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé described North American singer Kim Kardashian as a "hour."
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced was World War II.
The government’s first estimates in Tokyo estimated the damage to the property to be $300,000, a blow that appears to be weakening despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of cases, the data on gross domestic product from July to September were used to finally conclude this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the year-on-year rate.
The value measured in the second quarter – in Japan starting the fiscal year in March 2012 – also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The resurgence can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decline in capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual shift of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynesian strikes that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan is on the alert thanks in particular to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, spurred by growing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen – the Japanese currency – has become one of the “escape currencies” of investors fleeing the eurozone’s debt crisis and the gloomy forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is like a tombstone to the accounts of exporters.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, led their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the yen.
While the markets continue to beset the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
“One has to pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are really not very uplifting.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had given up clearer signs of slowing economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the brakes would have been pulled at the greatest economic potentials.
Because it fell by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average, which is at 100, after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens is once again in doubt.
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be passed, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high-risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece is also further mistaken in the labyrinth, which results from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the “consensus” of the new Greek transitional government is more of a reaction to pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly evidenced by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the days agreed upon at his appointment might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, will not assure the leader of the new party, but will assure the new party that he will take part.
“The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit on October 26,” Papadimos said yesterday to open a parliamentary debate that will reach its climax tomorrow with the confidence vote for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform the disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara’s statement does not rule out the doubts in his position: “We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but otherwise to nothing.”
The Conservative leader went one step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body that urgently needs the 8000 million that Athens needs, and he made it clear that he would not endorse a commitment statement on the implementation of austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the poker game with the Papandreou referendum, reaffirmed yesterday that its demand should not be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "didn't sign as unequivocally as possible".
Amadeu Altafaj, a spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said the Troika’s inspectors “very soon” returned to Athens to discuss with the new government “what is needed for the payment of the sixth section” amounting to 8000 million euros, although there is no finality.
The Greek kn<0xC3><0xA4>uel has threads for a while.
Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a: "These are instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "predominant" position regarding this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a predominant position in the role of minimum funding worldwide".
Queen Sofia of Spain recalled yesterday that Spain has become the second donor worldwide for international cooperation in the last two decades. Its "being" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice" and the hope of a better future for men.
The Queen announced yesterday the fifth World Summit on Small Loans in Valladolid. She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely indispensable" to reach the number of days spent by the United Nations until 2015 and "in particular the goal of reaching the goal of reaching the goal of reaching the Millennium
Spain "continues to work" on expanding the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task responsibly," remarked Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that will be undertaken by the summit, which will last until Thursday, will be considered to be the guarantor of the creation of the new Frazs<0xC3><0xA4>ft.
"We have achieved many successes" and "are facing many challenges."
The summit on small loans is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform to launch “two basic goals”.
The Queen stated that it will aim for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households will exceed the poverty line.
The concept of small loans goes back in Spain and the rest of the world to the "way initiated by Muhammad Yunus", which Queen Sofia considers an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financing instrument as an “amazing idealist who has been committed to the fight against poverty” and whose work she has known for 15 years since the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the local lending strategy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all of them, "we have been able to observe a continuous development", the Queen explained, whose commitment to this project was her assessment as a "family member of the Valendoupt" yesterday.
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her lecture by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Order"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical commandment" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid to times of economic booms, because it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez was of the opinion that small loans are a “serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty” and that the governments of industrialized countries should now “work more than ever” on solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, small loans are one of the “most important forms of development aid”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, lamented the "success", "marginalized" people who "always stand before closed doors" to give "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva, called the attendees "welcome to a city of Solre.
The CDU proposes to elect the EU president on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig was held for Angela Merkel, chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme, but has persisted in the autumn, in particular to provide enough for those activists who regard government policy with regard to Greece today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The European Commission's presidential proposal, proposed by the Bureau, was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against it, ten had voted against it.
The several-minute standing ovation, which was initially held by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble, leaves no doubt on the part of the three European finance ministers.
The Chancellor's main idea - as well as the application - carries the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be expressed by a revision of the Treaty of Lisbon, which strengthens the control of the European Union, with regard to the budgetary policies of the countries in the Eurozone; however, this could also be reflected in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote"to give Europe a face".
However, this is definitely one of the proposals adopted by Congress, clearly made by Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble Pate.
Of course, it is unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to it, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, the delegates, in an overwhelming majority, rejected the proposal to weight each country on the ECB’s board in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously brought with it a strengthening of Germany’s position.
The Chancellor, thinking about calming the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately conquer the arrogant Germany.
Insofar as the European request for a paragraph addresses the importance of the "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that two centuries ago, Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does fraud represent in the case of sickness reports?
After the family aid, the UMP and the government are now taking on the sick reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family aid fund and to discuss the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the attempt to put the economy in a test of hardness, but on the other hand is no less a foreshadowing of an axis of the right presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee complaints.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government is planning to introduce a fourth day of quarantine before taking into account a health report among employees in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the salary of four days without the approval of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
According to the newspaper Les Echos, a bribe that threatens to stir up anger would, however, help to bring in <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>280 million.
And those who went along with another more symbolic character: to grant the state officials an unpaid Karenztag in the case of illness (for as long as they do not have any Karenztag, unlike the three Karenztags in the private sector).
While these questions are in the discussion, the majority also re-evaluates the topic of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with absence of work.
"Controls will be significantly more important, and in addition, these are rebates if required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13th, ahead of the RTL's microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of disease reports seems a little disproportionate.
This has, in fact, been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 as well as political offensives, which have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer sicker than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us first look at the country-wide figures.
According to CNAM, more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million of daily payments were made in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of Health Care, the daily findings in 2008 amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion with 5% of health expenditure.
This figure was 46% for maternity leave as well as work accidents and 54% for sick leave, which is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
And, of course, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, on average, only 14.5 sick days were admitted to the French.
A median that obscures certain differences: Another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they didn’t take a single sick day.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of health reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbours, the French workers are thus no more inclined than elsewhere to be incapacitated.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global rate of absenteeism (founded on disease or otherwise) oscillated, or in France, between 10% and 11% against the United Kingdom, 20% and 28% against the United Kingdom, 20% and 28% in Denmark.
The fraud in the case of sickness reports represents a disappearingly small proportion with regard to black work.
With regard to fraud, only a weak scale is achieved here.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 entails that there are systematic checks in case of disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public College for the Training and Training of Technicians and Engineers) found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 short-term medical reports realized, i.e. in 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
For the systematically controlled cases of more than 45 days, the number of “unadjusted or unjustified” cases under 1.2 million was 11%, i.e. 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases on several million workers who have claimed a sick leave.
A digit that represents only a weak outline compared, for example, to that of the black work.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a case report published in July on this issue, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros in tax revenue per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus substantially more than the fraud committed by letz.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adaptation programme to capture its economy.
This was announced on Monday 14 November by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in front of Parliament, adding that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners as well as a new programme for budgetary adjustment," the head of government said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Euro Summit on 27 October is the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the Eurozone would be "on the game", he added.
Accordingly, Papademos has planned to reduce the country's state deficit "by 9%" of gross domestic product from today until the end of the year, after this 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right to refuse the new savings
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent on Monday to the already approved bribes in respect of an attempt to escape the debt crisis, but predicted that his party would not be prepared for an additional bribe.
"We will not vote in favour of new austerity measures," he said at a parliamentary meeting of his New Democracy party.
He had agreed with the requirements of reducing the budget deficit and debt, as well as the fight against waste, but he was hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic upswing.
Olli Rehn, an EU commissioner on economic and monetary affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties in support of the planned withdrawals, Antonio Samaras would not have responded under pressure and said that his word would not suffice.
Euthanasia and accompanying death must be legalized, says an expert panel
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The board stated that governments, health care institutions, and doctors were working together to provide the best pain-relieving remedies in terms of pain-relieving treatment, even beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society is living in a denial-of-death situation.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, which are linked in various disciplines, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government amend the penal code in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice is made, namely in patients who are considered capable of making such a decision.
As a start, the experts cite a recently published survey of the independent society EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that “medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the topic of death.”
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, according to experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
Despite the majority of Canadians’ desire to die at home, 68.6% of Canadians eventually die in the hospital.
Considered from all over the country, the rate is the highest in Quebec with 86% of hospitalized deaths.
In the delicate question concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already been abrogated, do not wish to make any changes to the penal law concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
But now, according to the experts, who would like to have inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization practices in their application, i.e., the practice of euthanasia or cohabitation, are not based on the practice of euthanasia or cohabitation.
On the contrary, there are significantly more cases of such violations in countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Accompanying suicide is also practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canada supports euthanasia
We are aware that, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already committed suicide in favor of euthanasia, as they believe it allowed people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the facts of a legalization of euthanasia do not result in conveying the message that the lives of older or disabled people are of less value.
When it comes to people who have already committed an accompanying suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the maintenance or adjustment of the means in patients, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Likewise, they point out in their recommendation that criminal law should be stated that the provision of funds for which a valid refusal has been made should not be considered criminal.
The expert panel also calls for healthcare professionals to be trained in the task of respecting a layoff of funds at the end of their lives, and to fear this without criminal prosecution.
The board stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, and this goes beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the funds already widely used in the Canadian health care institutions for pain relief or life-sustaining stomach abscesses, the Committee is calling for at least this to be taken into consideration, as they have served as little as euthanasia, to reduce these physical pain.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the legal field of health care have already made reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the reporting experts as "extreme", among other things, as they do not set any limits on euthanasia practice in patients in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation in which anyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years of age is asking another person to help him with his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual’s own responsibility over all other values involved in the social impact of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, also expressed “strong resistance” to the report’s conclusions, which she dubbed a “pro-euthanasia manifesto.”
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada itself, in particular doubts the reports on the non-prevention of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to step down
Damascus proclaims a "Complete"
Syria is more isolated.
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the authorities of the Auven ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, who, thanks to Russia’s support and a “complet” directed against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before Syria’s withdrawal from the Arab League, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbours, had taken a position in favor of an abdication of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the incumbent Arab prime minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to “put down his power in Syria” in which already around forty civilians and members of the government were killed.
“Put Bashar at the heart of his country’s interest, so he would resign, but in addition he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life,” the king of Jordan, Syria’s neighbour, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, had complained that the Turkish mediation efforts aimed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned with success.
“Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and who cannot satisfy them must go,” he said in reference to Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking a constantly harsher stance.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "enhancement of the consensus against Assad as well as the actions of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have hit an ever-increasing tone in the face of the repressions in Syria,” said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria have died, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
According to this NGO, two more civilians were killed in “shooting and heavy bomb attacks on Jobar” in the besieged city of Homs.
On the occasion of a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Muallim, was nevertheless of the view that the country would "control towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has reacted with emphasis to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its duties, which in his opinion represents a "dangerous step".
Syria "would not be abandoned," he added under the audacity that "the plots forged against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a “protection mechanism for civilians” and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Auvenhandelsminister Alain Juppé had also spoken out in favor of sending UN observers to protect civilians from repressions of the regime that encapsulates him in his "Paranoia".
A planned re-assembly of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat in order to discuss the implementation of the plan for the start of the crisis, in particular the controversial, foreseeable withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the release of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the decision of the Arab League "incorrect" yesterday to guard against the promotion of any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already warned Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti urges the markets to be patient and Italy to be ready for sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian head of government, has taken a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that "victims" demand to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties before today’s meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to call a cabinet in Parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
“Monti spoke of an important program with a number of victims,” said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups that participated in the talks after meeting with the incumbent President of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had to wait patiently for Mario Monti to put a vote of confidence in Parliament until Friday to make sure that the new government has enough support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by Mr Monti of a strike list, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness of the stock and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government as well as a government program, he stressed, noting that it is "certain that the markets will show themselves diligent and prudent".
His order by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The acting Prime Minister was supposed to establish a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would also like to involve "politicians".
The new government should only last until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Since taking up his role, Monti has committed himself to work urgently in the sense of the goal of making Italy the "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis with regard to the Italian economy itself does not change, taking into account the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budget balance target in 2013, despite the austerity plans that have been put in place in recent months, has in particular requested new austerity measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, Italy's chief executive, who will meet at Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic recovery, a country that has no growth that can't respect deficit indicators.
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epoque change" of Italy after 17 years "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trust" as well as a "other Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent previous elections, as Italy has to pay 200 billion euros in government bonds from now until April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helps Iran's Nuclear Energy Program
A Russian scientist, Wyatsheslaw Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-armed explosive device, an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recently published report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by this UN agency to determine this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA announced its “serious concerns” on the occasion of a “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to an in-depth study of the IAEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked for over three decades at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the center to start a company in Kiev that produces "Nano-Diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Prior to his return to Russia, he participated in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentioned "strong indications that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive system "has been supported by the work of a foreign expert, who is not only at the forefront of this technology, but is also able to inform about how a member of the Agency's state-of-the-art technology has been communicated to its military program, as well as to its experts.
Anti-Islamic Crimes and Crimes Increase by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, have either slightly declined or only slightly increased.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, while a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease against Jews, and a 14% increase in anti-trafficking and a 14% increase in anti-trafficking crimes.
The total number of “hate-motivated crimes” has increased to 6,628 cases in very weak cases, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious-motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," Human Rights First stressed. "The rise of anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," Paul Legendre, a senior official in the organization, said in a statement.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to combat these attacks,” he added, adding that this could be done by improving police attitudes towards “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" is represented in American federal law as an inheritance from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence against race, skin color, religion or descent and now also includes crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing the platform and is increasingly similar to Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activities of those who follow their posts, which once again makes the service more similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" enable better readable live tracking of the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet user, whose messages ("Tweets") you are tracking and who are tracking your messages.
This allows you to find out if they allow you to track your messages, whether you subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday "in August with a small percentage of users", Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, equipped with something esoteric innate verbatim (RT zum referenzierten repeat des Beitrages einer persone). followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiates, thus opening up a wider audience with a handle more comparable to that of the social networks Google+ public.
In the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" over the Internet.
“This is useless, intrusive and looks like too much Facebook,” <0x40>jemb123 writes.
"The 'Activity' feature will help me better track certain elements of my flux Twitter," <0x40>dannykronstrom said.
Austria-Hungary
Entry of a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution
The government of the great Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition, which is in power in Austria, has decided on Tuesday to incorporate a "Golden Budget Rule" into the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also a possible degradation by rating agencies in top agencies.
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann personally who had announced this decision of the exit of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian state debt is at 74.6%, i.e. far above the criterion established by the Maastricht Treaty or 60%, but clearly below the threshold of Italy, Spain.
“If Austria’s ability to pay was not reduced to a blow from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion a year,” said Michael Spindelegger, vice chancellor and Christian Democratic Auven Minister.
Austria also makes a demand for the Brussels Eurozone Member States’ summit of 26 October: the Heads of State or Government would then have included the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to public balance of accounts by means of a constitution or a balance of account.
The takeover taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to incorporate such a "rule" into the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, as of 2017 the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas regional states should have balanced households as well as municipalities.
The objective is to reduce the budgetary debt in the 2020/21 horizon under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Starker Yen
Noda threatens new intervention in the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese government would intervene again in the currency markets if the yen were to continue to rise.
“If we were to establish excessive volatility in the yen’s exchange rate, we would intervene just as we did last time,” Noda said in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was again accelerated close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against the dollar to lower the Japanese currency value, which is in the process of taxing a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has risen steadily over this, dubbed by the purchases of investors who see the yen as a “refugee value” in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro has slipped below the symbolic lat of 105 yen near the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar recorded 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago as it consumes the costs of "Made in Japan" products and reduces the value of income drawn by Japanese companies from abroad as these exchange them in national currency.
“Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and the tsunami on March 11 that devastated the Tohoku region,” said Noda, who fears that this strain of the yen could kill the weak ascent already in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time this year thanks to explosive export increases and the consumption of the households "flooded" by the disaster has again gained traction.
However, the prime minister estimates that the yen’s value does not “reflect Japan’s economic foundations.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday to take all possible measures to defuse the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, however, noted that the BoJ had already initiated "appropriate withdrawals", making it plausible that no additional currency devaluation could be expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the Notenbank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to add the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) amount of coverage it had spent on various purchases of financial securities.
Eurozone:
Interest rates fast up, exchanges make withdrawals
The risk of the debt crisis is constantly intermingling with European key figures.
Despite the appointment of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are also drifting a little further into negative fields on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions over the return on government bonds in the troubled eurozone, global stock markets are continuing to release some of their recent profits.
“Capital investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection,” Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The stock market in Tokyo, which in turn suffers from the renewed fear of market participants regarding the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continues, had closed with a decrease of 0.7%.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving on a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the euro area is damaging the single currency, which will continue to bear its brunt on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 a.m. the European currency was worth 1.3570 dollars, so it declined by 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it has declined after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had met in Congress on Monday, made a request, which in particular provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the Eurozone without simultaneously delaying the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The interest rates of Italy and Spain continue to be at a very alarming level.
This Tuesday morning, the return on the Italian bonds reached 6.85% over 10 years, the return on the Spanish title matured to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel investors’ fears.
The future Italian head of government Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy threatened by the debt burden.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the sights of the markets as the country’s parliamentary elections take place on Sunday.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
Expected growth in the Eurozone
Statistically, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% borne by domestic consumption in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the figures for the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it’s the fourth quarter that worries economic experts the most.
Germany, for its part, had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first Eurozone-wide high-rise is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or because of emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power as well as the competitiveness of companies.
It makes sense to take an election meeting for an occasion, to think about this topic as well as about the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it probes the overall economic, social and ecological consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of the demand for electricity by 2050, not a huge proportion of the world’s population is expected to give up a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to mitigate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity without the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to remain isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision to find a substitute source capable of substitution, nor in Switzerland, which is currently planning to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
The United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, has decided to join another unit in its park by reactivating the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, which is geared towards renewable energy sources, is occasionally set as an example, the reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will take the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence on imported gas, in particular on Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will become noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives reason to think.
Denmark, on the one hand, is a European leader in wind energy, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; on the other hand, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are equivalent to 65% and 50% respectively.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity bill, unlike our French households.
As the energy price in the globalised economy plays a key role in competitiveness as well as a stability trap for industry on national soil, the French companies have an advantage due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong rise in the price of energy, which would have led to the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power to the illusion.
Surveys have found that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are not willing to pay as much as it would allow them to recognise resistance to the principle of this energy source.
We are aware that the energy policy of our country has enabled us to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a large number of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
Should France decide to step out of nuclear power, much of this SME would fall victim to this, and the annual <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion in investment goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would be commissioned to operate an EPR designed to run for sixty years if its producer’s downfall is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, one has to admit that there is as little of a devil’s work as there is a miracle agent for generating electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy demonstrate the complementarity of the energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that conducts uncompromising and transparent checks on existing works, such as the construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves due to their professionalism, are currently obsessed with the safety performance.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious disruptions.
Only one, namely in Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; so it ran without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was challenged by reactor construction as well as innocent human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters was never caused by an unprecedented amount, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it did after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach as well as a cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a design that allows it to withstand such phenomena.
As it is considered desirable among the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a building block in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by letting them take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is inevitable and legitimate to look for the best energy package for our country, but it would be irresponsible to have emotions, dogmas and party leaders dominate a debate that determines our country’s economic, social and financial situation as well.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overloading of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the numbers, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France itself had titled.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students had shaped the week-long spectacles on the part of the government, the interior minister had casually announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France “needs no talent, maurers or waiters from abroad”.
But this policy has rarely been analyzed from an economic point of view.
This is the subject of a far-reaching consensus between the right and the left.
On the right side was the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had explained in 1990, France "could not absorb all the poverty of the world".
The only difference is in the degree of gravity.
Fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish clamps was shared by both right and left in 2005.
From both camps, immigrants were perceived as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is in the degree of greed that one is willing to admit to the immigrants.
In his programme, Francois Hollande confines himself to banalities that indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on elections; however, it is economically costly.
How economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present us in a recently published work that summarizes the latest findings regarding immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, pp. 352).
Restricting immigration would de-escalate growth and damage the labour market situation.
The concerns over the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to replace the local workers, especially the less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact significantly more complementary than local wage workers, as they focus on professions in sectors that are technically unexploded.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that attract little local wage earners, the more qualified among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not commensurate with the job offer.
Positive pay effect
Just as a surgeon would have trouble working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthetists, this complementarity also has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labour market situation between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the influx of immigrants leads to a medium-term, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants is appropriate (a high proportion of immigrant citizens among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to the social systems, in European countries on an average of about 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 will contribute an average net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring the missing intersections "with the teeth" to the entrance of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which were supposed to deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself, who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, over the entire 20th century about the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, of the Holocaust, of the Gulag, but also of Franco in Spain, of Salazar in Portugal, and of the Supreme in Greece has left over.
Some had probably believed it was rich enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy once and for all prevail over its enemies.
It has been known since Napoleon's "the little one" that it was a feature of the attitude of the mind.
The universal suffrage, which is a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this, and can become just as good a "repression instrument" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires far more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of the forces, an education, an economic and social spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe in which we are located is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and above all a political and democratic crisis.
The change of opinion of the Greek True-False referendum would have had a double-disclosure character in this respect: once the need for a vigorous return to politics, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing feeling of their impossibility, of their inadequacy.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer aim in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for the success of the internal referendum, which was organized in accordance with the needs and in a wrong order.
A free rein for the European sole ruler or a leap into the void of the nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want hacking, but a collective task, out of full justice, clarified and constant, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you no longer know where to end the list - since there is only one crisis, and this one prevails in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is bowing to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, which suffer from its powerlessness and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at the international level.
One is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus each individual of the nations that are part of it.
The urgency is to give the sovereignty of the people back to the leadership of the European project.
For it is up to the Europeans to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and propel a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level on the condition that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without leading us to destruction.
After the long struggle between Jacques Delors and the Socialists over this proposal, today everyone is pushing European economic leadership to do so.
Agreed.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it presupposes citizens - would be a new folly and yet another dead end.
We need to take on a new stage of European development.
In order to create a republic in France, it required the fact of "creating" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This teaching remains valid.
We need to build a better integrated Europe at the economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Uncontacted" chip cards become commonplace
The World Chip Card Fair opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic position.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM-card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is the contactless technology, which allows payments in public transport or the matching of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year ago, 460 million contactless chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide this year!
Its market share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payments, after a long period of reflection in the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards were distributed.
However, the consumer markets are steaming.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move at a higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
“Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out contactless cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A declining percentage of devices has so far been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology needed to carry out these transactions.
"They've been delayed."
"But they should at least experience a real upward development next year."
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société Générale had said yesterday to prepare for the market launch of an offer that allows its customers to make contactless payments by mobile phone.
Terrorist Front Understands, From the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-awaited relationship between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seems to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria’s Deputy Vice-Auven Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers has now “achieved certainty” about it.
"The way in which the two organizations proceed, as well as the relations of the intelligence services, indicate clear cooperation," he said, without going into detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
Investigations into the kidnapping of two French people in Niger last January have promoted interfaces to the present day.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi, were reportedly killed on the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators want to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble at the site of the operation.
Terrorism Axis
The analysis of the conducted telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one leads to a Nigerian who had stopped for a long time in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who stands as the Aqmi and the Sekte.
"This is a progress, but we must wait for no doubt more clear evidence before we can talk about an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
“But it is conceivable.”
“It has been known for years that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from Auwen and that they are increasingly active,” says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become more and more apparent in their course, as have the addresses and modes of operation of Boko Harem, which have now been used to draw suicide bombers as well as the use of increasingly complex explosives, such as those used by hand.
The international community, to begin with at Washington, has since exerted pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed long considered the group to be a community of Illuminati, which does not need to be given special attention.
Faster success
The Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haussa means as much as "Western education is a disgrace" - pursues the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this middleless region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
She politicizes herself and demands strict adherence to the sharia, while her affiliated activists engage in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in sight.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in their intensified attacks against the Commissariat.
However, Abuja’s reaction is, as usual, indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, counting 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was captured, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect gradually becomes more radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an assassination in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is blamed for a suicide bombing that took place in the secured police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations will become a priority international target.
Since then, the formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has worried all security experts.
While the Aqmi occupied Mali and Niger to operate the Somalis of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem appears to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé had warned Boko Harem about a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria and was willing to "dispatch official information".
The World Behind Republican Presidential Candidates <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance regarding China, Iraq and aid to Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple not to say: simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates like this, the voters could almost get that impression.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and their fellow contestants have repeatedly made their statements and statements about Auburn politics, a traditional Republican focus, plausible.
Over China, Iran, and Israel help fall – often in no way underpinned – slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" at the highest level, Mitt Romney threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and to address them with the "currency manipulation" - a leading theme in an America that is rigged to the top by the migration of entire industrial branches to Asia.
Stupidly, if this is meant to imply the start of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of Auven politics, has almost sniffed the air with regard to his emotive gesture.
He had called for a hands-on but constructive exchange of talks with Beijing (also Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman is not heard as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also vowed military strikes against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear program were to fail.
"If I'm elected, I'm going to detain Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb".
On the other hand, he promised Israel enhanced military assistance and accused Obama of remaining guilty to this partner’s obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-placed candidate, in turn bears a shameful lack of knowledge.
Recently, he called for countering China’s military threat, as Beijing “trying to develop a nuclear power” – and it seemed to be paying attention to the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, for his part, vowed to be ready to take the U.S. Army into service in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama’s 2009 denial of torture against suspected terrorists was also endorsed by Cain, Perry, and the Michele Bachmann candidacy.
One is far away from John McCain, the 2008 Republican candidate, an auven political heavyweight.
Against the current presidential contractors, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They call to mind that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give water to his wine on the issue of anti-terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his na<0xC3><0xAF>ve dialogue with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his “boys” from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of weakness.
This hostility, however, is not so unforced.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive balance of national security under Obama, who has shut down bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been protecting itself from military interventions that lead to de-escalation.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to reawaken its leadership position to a new life.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is expected to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to conduct this event with brilliance and glory.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the opening of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea level, under the orchestral sound on the Baltic Sea coast and at the fine tasting buffet last Tuesday.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have symbolically jointly turned the control of the valve, which transports Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year will be delivered to Western Europe through a first 1,224 km long pipeline connecting the Saint Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas – the equivalent of French total consumption – is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already let the possibility of building a third line come to an end on its own.
For Gazprom, the timely and punctual completion of this enormous building seems like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will enable a direct gas delivery to Germany, by avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the highway.
For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: for them it is now becoming more difficult to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most heavily engaged in the debate, was not shy about comparing the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive in the first place.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of de-energizing European energy, as the project has hit a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which have strong gas consumptions and tend to their gas stocks.
“This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way,” said Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out the extent to which large gas contracts are also important from the political and economic side.
All this explains the broad smile of the Gazprom manager, represented in Lubmin numerous times, regarding the gas supply line.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line is made of steel with concrete assembly, which is intended to protect it from ship sinks.
It rests on the sea floor, at about 200 m depth.
During its construction, minefields dating from World War II had to be avoided.
"Some hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed with care," said Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
On the other hand, reinforced baits had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which has not been interrupted by anything over the entire length: either by valves or maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers distanced themselves from it, as the Swedes had little reason to see a Russian state society settle permanently at the height of its coasts.
“In the event of an accident, we close the gas outlet in less than a minute,” said Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
In the event of a leak, the gas located in the gas line escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the designers to be unlikely, as the swivel seams were estimated to have a resistance of one leak per 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot, which is controlled from a sea vessel for external observation purposes, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, mivt a meter in diameter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and moved by the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on possible deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas remote was designed to work for fifty years without having to undergo even the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to realize this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated here (up to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group of companies GDF Suez (up to 9%).
These five companies have formed a business community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favorable.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport, namely on an extendable twenty-year contract.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the amount of gas that is actually transported is,” said Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% by shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the total investment was 240 million.
The minority shareholders, however, are determined to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone carries the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline comes ashore on a sandy, pine-wooded coastline near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-meter-high valves form the gas outlet ports.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristic numbers of the incoming gas before it is passed on to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per expansive hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent at candlelight with writing.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognizable again, with its black, rectangular insert, its rubber band, the egg-shelled sides, as it ages over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as it is known today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided to bring a distinguished design notebook to the market at the time.
Maria Sebregondi, then a specialist advisor to the company, is in charge of the market launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called Mole Skin, which is called a cotton lacquer, which is used, for example, for covers of upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was in high demand among writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes in.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and settled with a sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is run in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to produce a phantom image of the buyer, as the notebook excites both business people and students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of city centers and understands how to enforce its identity.
“We have followed the spirit of the times and his new writing needs, which, despite the upswing of the emails, exists,” said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural character trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg)", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, at the Locarno Film Festival, the company also launched a pair of leopard patterns on the market.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural zeitgeist and understood how to diversify his products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer covers... The brand displays the full range of articles.
A success that has come to the fore: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought up by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today’s Syntegra Capital, and thus offered a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th week of work for the disabled".
Despite a deliberate public policy that was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is always twice as high as the average: 19% versus 9% of the total population.
Disgusting?
"No, so emphasizes <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, which organizes the "Work Week for the Disabled."
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still a lot to do."
However, it must be said that for the disabled, many obstacles continue to exist before they get a job.
The elderly are more common: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have an undergraduate degree and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with a higher education degree.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the disabled compared to 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to get back to work and that form the “core of the problem,” says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the brakes.
Remains the unspoken, the attitudes of the mind, which, though certain, but slowly develop.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-entreprendre association for La Cité magazine stated that the managers surveyed had "a weak level of knowledge regarding the disabled", which was "overrepresented" "by persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disabled".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, which was set out in a 1987 law.
These last-mentioned figures, from 2008, refer to a quotient of 2.6%.
“We are now at 3%,” said Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization that is charged with soliciting contributions from companies that are violating this law.
The evidence: The number of "fees paid" establishments has decreased as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on companies,” explained Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also brings out a real insight, especially in the large corporate groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the workplaces between 20 and 49 employees are disabled workers, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a lucky thing"
Even before the blue Tuesday evenings (20:45 a.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not honored their enjoyment of the friendly game.
It would have been too far-fetched to claim there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks of symbolic tapes.
Sitting side by side on the spectator stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had garnered nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," assures the native Liller.
As for the contrast between his portrayal in club and national elf, "It's a unity that justifies everything."
"In Lille I'm over the whole year, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought on Friday night against Romania regarding the match against France, to finally "glow".
However, without neglecting the note of "pleasure".
He has been leading the French national team since the age of 7, leading his winning field races between 1998 and 2000.
"I have always been supported," he said.
This inevitably contributes to further strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he said.
“We’ve just been on the road.”
"To be able to play against them means great luck!"
Leekens, on the other hand, had "stole" with kindness.
"The pride of being a galatch".
"I am proud" also to confirm - in his capacity as a "neighbor" - that France "has become a team again at a very high level", and this little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job," he said excitedly.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the plane with the Blues (the French national team) ... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians are coming out big," he stressed.
“We’re about to plan one thing, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You will notice this in the upcoming games." The game against France included.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is very optimistic about the replay against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the game, both teams had missed the game.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and above all a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Select<0xC3><0xA7>ao", his national elf, for whom he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this means, in fact, only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and an opponent to reserve, namely Bosnia.
Considering the draw (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated the game clearly for more than an hour, but the team was not able to push the matter to such an important stamp that the pressure would have taken from it.
"That's a good result, but there's some risk because we haven't reached an outer gate."
At home, however, in their brightly radiating Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to beat themselves in front of an audience that is equally likely to be on the game, even if the game was announced as "very scarce", said the optimistic but clear Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but are completely convinced that we can win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance to be in the 2012 European Championship,” said Carlos Queiroz’s successor.
The split on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win a goal.
A disagreement can already be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a gate.
“This is a good result, but there is some risk, as we have not reached an outer gate,” Bento regrets.
“We will be competing against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities,” he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese had planned to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning, in order to "give them no time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is implemented this time.
