Last minute: Our Cosmic Visitor Dev Asteroid 2014 JO25
There are perhaps billions of more giant asteroids that roam the Solar System headlessly and can cause serious consequences when they collide.
The path of these objects, which may have closed or open orbits remaining from the formation of the Sun, can sometimes pass through the Earth.
The 650-meter-wide asteroid 2014 JO25 will pass through such a visitor and today at 14:24 the nearest position to Earth will be 1.75 million km away.
As the day went on, we became more aware of this kind of news.
The most important reason for this is the developments in observation techniques and observation tools.
This allows us to determine smaller asteroids that have not been identified before.
For example, in January last year, an asteroid the size of a bus passed only half the distance between Earth and the Moon (<0x7E>250,000 km).
And even more interesting, it could only be determined a few days before the asteroid crossing.
So there could be other cosmic buses coming over us right now.
What do you do if you get the idea that an asteroid over 20 meters in diameter is going to fall right into the middle of the temple?
In fact, asteroids of this size won’t destroy your bulge, but they’ll probably blow up the windows of all buildings.
This will be due to shock waves from the asteroid that will invade the atmosphere.
For example, the asteroid that fell to Russia in 2013 was of this size, and it was enough to break down the windows of buildings in several cities.
However, if you have a target of an asteroid over 100 meters, you should go at least 50 km from your recommended target.
Criteria such as the size and angle of impact of the asteroid are the factors that determine the depth and damage the crater will cause.
According to the European Space Agency's simulation, let's look at a few scenarios.
If a 100-metre-wide asteroid hits Earth at a 45-degree angle at 60 km per second, it forms a crater with a depth of about 250 meters and a diameter of 1200 meters.
According to the Richter scale, the impact is equal to the magnitude of the earthquake at 6, and even if you are more than 10 km from the impact point, your body will have a 3rd degree of burn.
The other 50 km away, the broken windows will be waiting.
If he hits an asteroid over a mile across, the situation becomes even more debilitating.
If such an asteroid hits the Earth with the same angle and velocity, it forms a crater at a depth of about 600 meters and a diameter of 12 km.
So a large sediment turns into a crater and disappears instantly.
Even if you are 100 km away from the point of impact due to the heat produced by the impact, there is a 3rd degree burn in your body.
According to the Richter scale, the impact is equal to the earthquake at 8 magnitudes.
The damage caused by the asteroid depends not only on the chemical composition of the asteroid, but also on the rock structure of the region where it will hit.
The above values are given by reference to a scenario that occurs when a hard rock-like asteroid falls into an area made up of tortuous rocks.
If the asteroid is mostly made of iron, then if it falls to a surface with the cooling of the lava, the size of the crater will increase by 3 times, and the resulting disaster will be doubled accordingly.
66 million years ago, something worse had happened to the dinosaurs, and they were hit by an asteroid about 10 km in diameter.
As a result of the asteroid collision, 75 percent of marine and terrestrial life was instantly destroyed.
If this large asteroid has targeted Earth, which destroys the dinosaurs, be sure to leave the planet with the strongest option.
There are tons of matter falling into space every day.
Most of it burns and ash in the atmosphere.
Some of the nebulae that are large enough to burn in the atmosphere cause the glare known as the star shift between the people.
Let’s end with another story that will make our writing comfortable.
Studies show that over the next 300-400 years, a huge asteroid is not expected to hit the Earth, which will cause very serious damage.
As an average of 70-year-old animals, I'm sure you've got a clue.
Flash for medel: <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million!
Gary Medel, who wants to supplement the Stoper area, is looking forward to the departure of the Black-Whites' name on Inter's agenda...
The 30-year-old football player, who goes on holiday after wearing a form in the Confederations Cup in Chilean form and starts working with Inter in recent days, is waiting for his future offers.
Gazzetta dello Sport, one of the Italians’ prestigious newspapers, suggested that Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> made a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million bid to Inter for Medel, who can both stop and take a job in the front libero region.
While the Black and Whites, who offered the offer to Medel, said they were expecting an answer from both sides, it was noted that the Chilean footballer was looking forward to living with his family in Istanbul.
Despite this claim by Gazzetta, the FFP restriction on Black Kartal is quite difficult to pay a fee such as <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million for Medel.
Black-and-whites are likely to put the star player in the squad if they go for a serious discount on the Medel via hire as they did on Caner Free Transfer.

Human rights group has issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People issued a warning for colored people to travel to Missouri because of the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group’s announcement reads: “The NAACP Travel Advisory Notice of the State of Missouri is valid from August 28, 2017, as the African-American travelers, visitors, and Missouri residents have recently been on their way to the end of their journey to the state of emergency, and as a result of the fact that suspicious, racially-based incidents are occurring across the state.”
The NAACP said a new Missouri law has made it harder for people to win discrimination cases, while at the same time targeting minorities disproportionately from state law enforcement, the group is effective in issuing this travel warning.
“There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They’re being stopped, beaten and killed because of the color of their skin,” Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP, told Kansan City Star.
"We hear complaints when we haven't heard them before."
The association is issuing such a warning for the first time for a state in the United States.
The group exemplified the racist insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the deaths of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders was taken into custody earlier this year, after his fuel went through the state, without being charged with a crime by the Missouri police, and died under suspicious conditions.
The advisory also notes a new report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office that shows that black drivers in the state are more likely to be stopped by 75 percent than whites.
“The notice of recommendation is for people to be awake and to warn their families, friends, and coworkers about what they might be in Missouri,” Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared to bring the ransom with them, to let their relatives know they're going to pass through this state."
In Missouri, according to the latest figures in the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015, putting the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning also responds to a new Missouri law that makes it harder for a business to sue for discrimination while renting a home or doing a job.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona, after local enforcement authorities in these states ordered people to be arrested for immigration violations; the ACLU has issued a travel recommendation that will be followed by a racially motivated crackdown.
Travel alerts are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but defense groups have recently resorted to this application in response to a set of laws and trends within the United States.
Demba Ba in Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>
Demba Ba, who transferred to Shanghai Shenhua for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>13 million two seasons ago and hired to the Black and Whites last season, returns to Besikta<0xC5><0x9F> free of charge.
Kara Kartal, who requested a detailed health report from the Senegalese player last week, took action following the report from the star footballer.
The Black-and-White administration, which began work for a 32-year-old player that the Chinese representative did not think of in the squad next season, stole the door of the Shanghai team.
Not on the list
Demba Ba, who was not on the list because of his foreign status in China, told the administration that he wanted to return to the Black-Whites.
The Chinese team has confirmed the departure of a 32-year-old player.
The Senegalese footballer is expected to sign an official contract by coming to Turkey in the coming days.
The castle was built in Trabzonspor.
In a statement on the website of the Bordo-mavili club, Castillo said that he had an arthroscopic meniscus surgery from the left knee at Istanbul Liv Hospital, "Our post-operative player performed by Prof. Dr. U<0xC4><0x9F>ur H<0xC3><0xBC>klar, started training with the team in 4 weeks.
Castillo was injured in a right-back in a prepared match played by the Bordo-Mavili team at the Slovakian camp with the Dutch team Heerenveen.
The Colombian player, who was announced to stay away from the field for 3-4 weeks due to his treatment, was also determined to have surgery due to the meniscus problem he had previously experienced.
Referendum from Barzan!
Barzani delivered a speech at the commemoration ceremony in Duhok due to the 3rd anniversary of DEA<0xC5><0x9E>'s attack on the Ezids in the Sincar district of Mosul.
In his speech, Barzani, referring to the independence referendum that the IKBY wants to hold on September 25, said: "I have to say this with regret that we have no hope that Iraq will be a right and proper country."
We tried all the way with Iraq, but we were completely hopeless and hopeless.
The past experiences we have had with Iraq have brought us to this point, and there is no guarantee that we can take our rights and protect them.
So we need to show that, in order to ensure life and security together, we can all assign our destiny to the whole world through referendum.
I also need to draw gold on this; referendum is not a goal for us, but a tool for us to achieve a larger goal.
Barzani, recalling that the Iraqi central government had many promises to the Kurds after the 2003 fall of the Ba'ath regime, said that a direct referendum decision was taken shortly after the fight with DEA<0xC5><0x9E>.
Barzani, speaking of the desire of the IKBY people to peacefully and democratically determine their destiny for the protection and development of the IKBY people, said: “It appeared with the bills that Iraq cannot or does not want to protect us like a state.”
"He doesn't want us to move forward," he said.
Barzani noted that the Iraqi central government did not give them weapons during the fight with DEA<0xC5><0x9E>, but within a short period of time, Hashdi Shabi, who was formed with a fatwa, was immediately legalized and responded that all weapons were provided:
Within Iraq's defense system, Pesmerge was not interviewed.
The central government did not do what it offered to Hasdi Shabi to Pe<0xC5><0x9F>merge.
According to the constitution, Pe<0xC5><0x9F>merge is considered part of Iraq’s defense system.
But when Hashdi Shabi did not exist in the constitution, the laws were violated and all possibilities were diverted.
We're not saying we're against Hashdi Shabi.
Pe<0xC5><0x9F>merge and Hashdi <0xC5><0x9E>abi fought on the same front, and on the one hand, while Hashdi <0xC5><0x9E>abi is being legalized, the existence of Pe<0xC5><0x9F>mergen and the fight against terrorism is being covered.
These are the deep wounds that we have with our bandages.
The terrorist organization DEA<0xC5><0x9E> organized an attack on the Ezidi people living in the Sincar district of Mosul on August 3, 2014, killing many of the people, including women and children.
He returned from the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade in 10 minutes.
According to the BBC, the Boeing 777 passenger plane belonging to Air France aircraft was in the west of Hokkaido in northern Japan while the North Korean missile was in flight.
Officials recording that the rocket landed in the area where the plane was located 10 minutes ago said it was estimated to be approaching 100-150 kilometers to the plane.
Air France said in a statement that the missile did not interfere with the route of the aircraft and that there was no problem with the flight.
“The information we have at this stage shows that the missile has fallen into the sea more than 100 kilometers away from the plane’s route,” the statement said.
Nothing is sacred, right?
Trump’s White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most obvious sign of regime change is that they start attacking statues.
The Americans know this as much as any of their personnel; indeed, the carefully planned overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003 in the Firdos Square in Baghdad...
Stephen Miller, one of the key founders of the Trump regime, knew exactly what the president and CNN’s Jim Acosta were doing in a heated debate over legal immigration restrictive proposals, while symbolically destroying the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
If he had done so, the owner of a full boat tour and the replicator of Liberty would have lynched him.
But he attacked his mansion, and especially in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed, Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to the monument base.
Miller told Acosta: “I don’t want to talk about history from the beginning to the end here, but the Statue of Liberty... is the symbol of American freedom for the world of light.
The poem you are talking about was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller's right, but as he said, it's not really about history.
This is about the contemporary echoing of Lazarus’ terrifying words, in which not only does a state invite not only some elderly immigrants but also the poor, inviting the poor: “Dead, poor, / crowded crowds of the oppressed to take a breath of freedom / temptation to take a breath of fresh air.
There has never been a time when "not asking for forgiveness" was so visible on our screens.
Miller did not bring a literary criticism; he explained that these people were not welcomed in the United States by Trump.
The conflict over the mana of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict over the mana of America.
After Lazarus and his death, his friends, who campaigned to put his words on the statue's foundation, knew very well that they had entered into quite a political action.
The statue was intended to celebrate the connections between the French and American republics by pressing a procession and representing the female form of Freedom with the development of the body.
Lazarus changed this mana: in his poem, the figure of the woman was no longer an orphan, but a voice.
And he gives her a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
Marriage with the image of the poem is a dramatic feminist blow and a devastating attack on the American immigrant resistance.
And just as Lazarus changed the mana of the statue, the right-wingers wanted to change it back for a long time.
Rush Limbaugh, a great Baptist John-style speaker for Trump's arrival, argued that freedom did not invite anyone in 2010, but rather that it was an early revolutionary neocon who kept the American fire in the dark world: "Mrs. Freedom is coming forward.
He's there to move his freedom movement from the United States to the rest of the world.
It's not to lighten the way to the United States."
In a very unusual way, Limbaugh had actually discovered something.
The statue's mana was entirely related to the sense of perception.
The magnificent creative act of Lazarus was to see it as if the ships were seen on the decks of exhausted, desperate but hopeful people after long and often disastrous voyages.
This was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people looking for a place to shelter and wanting to improve their lives.
His statue responded to them by welcoming them warmly, with words of hope and the need to hear.
Of course, this is not a prospect that Miller and Trump will find right in any way.
It is not to lead their occupation, but to reduce their hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black congratulates the Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots could join the UK team
Neil Black, the UK's director of athletics performance, says the 16-member Scottish team will make a "major contribution" to the squad.
The record-breaking Scottish athlete was selected for London 2017 starting Friday.
Black believes in Scotland that “something is developing” and that UK athletics should learn from it.
Black said, “We’re adopting this and we’re trying to understand it and we’re going to work until it gets out of hand.”
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it’s about what they’re doing.
Scottish Athletics thinks it has something to do with what they do.
British Athletics: They think it’s about what they do.
The man on the street in the corner, too.
Whatever the combination of conditions, it’s absolutely great.”
Laura Muir and many Scottish athletes, including Andrew Butchart, who will race against Sir Mo Farah at 5000 m, are competing for the medal, and Eilidh Doyle was chosen as the captain by the squad.
"He's going to be a little low-volunteer.
The Captain's speech was incredible," Black said.
"Whether it's Scottish or wherever he lives or is training, a few athletes are very proud and really motivated from that room.
Eilidh's passion and true feeling were natural."
The silver medalist from the League of Nations, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at his fifth World Championship, says 16 Scotland are "unbelievable" to be in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes in the previous world championships was seven, which was achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Last year, Muir was the middle-distance runner who broke five British and two European records.
It's going to be 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another Scotlander, Chris O'Hare, who has spent a very good season including the British Team Tests and victories in the Year Return Games, will be watching at 1500 m.
Doyle remembers the first Scottish champion in the team, Lee McConnell.
The team captain says he is "very proud" of the move that many nurses will not only join the team but in some cases will compete for the medal and give him the fight to stay in the finals.
“Being captain of the team was special, it was with the votes given by other members of the team, so it was already a huge honor to know that your teammates voted for you and that they chose you made it extra special for me,” he added.
"Obviously, I'm proud of all the Scots who join the team.
This shows how far we've come.
And they're here, as self-proven athletes, as athletes watching the podium.
As for the Captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I took advantage of the fact that we are very lucky in this situation, in the sense that we have a World Championship at home.
I mean, it's really just the effect of being able to take advantage of this inner-field support and being successful with the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I’m taking a second chance to go out there and fight and there will be such a great atmosphere.”
Preventing Critics on Facebook: If You Can't Lift Voters' Criticisms, Be a State Candidate
The father of our country had a lot of knowledge about being negative in the press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to start criticising him for everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Of course, he was embarrassed by the criticism.
But the critics did not silence him.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "freedom of speech can be abolished and we can be dragged to shore in a stupid and silent manner."
This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan’s staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union also sued him earlier this week.
The governor’s staff didn’t care about the case because it was not serious, and online reviews were full of “who cares?” reactions.
A lot of people say, “It’s just Facebook.”
But that's important.
That's especially important when you're like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor who is surprisingly popular in a state that is overwhelmingly Democratic.
It has the second highest charting rate among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan's not a crazy nut.
He was a leader of the state and a master of strict adherence to the principles.
He was also quite skilled at using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his constituents by presenting his hairless head jokingly after chemotherapy.
That is to say, it is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to prevent people coming to the page of the governor, who is an open forum to the public, who is officially classified and paid for by members of the people’s tax dollars.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s executions by claiming that blocking comments was no more than regulating them.
But it’s very easy to use images of trolls or spammers or people who are full of hate online verbal attacks.
The Post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are the real people who speak only to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner, and a priest; not a troll.
They all said their comments were not respectful, thoughtful, and defiant.
The pope made a reference to the Bible by referring to Hogan's Catholic faith in his sharing.
Maryland Bowie's lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani wasn't full of hate, but he asked questions about hate crimes.
He wrote in The Post's comment section, "I politely made the comment that I was disappointed that he was not responding to hate crimes and other recent news."
"I also don't like the idea that when many people comment on the same subject, almost some people ignore it as a collective effort from a large group of concerned citizens."
Others would probably call the governor's staff a "concentrated spam attack", or "opinion defense."
The Facebook era makes it easier for a message to be easily adapted by blocking an opponent or by deleting a negative message.
The staff outside are much cleaner than the old days when they were sent to collect and burn the newspapers where critical writings were written or to arrest and silence protesters.
Even if it’s digital, that’s exactly what happens.
Hogan is not the first public task to be criticized for disabling Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter.
One of the possible future reference decisions on this issue came from Virginia last week.
Loudoun’s chairman of the Board of Supervisors, U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris, in Alexandria, was against the First Amendment when he banned a voter on Facebook.
Governor Matt Bevin (Republican) was also visited by the ACLU in Kentucky due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the reasonably priced postal revolution had a quite similar effect on the Internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers was quadrupled, and unknown letter writers overtook his leadership.
Even then, Washington had unnamed trolls.
All the people who used nicknames like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to the newspapers that undercut Washington's decisions.
According to the online George Washington Articles Project, which collected historical documents, the petition office was overwhelmed by the criticism of its stance on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade, and Navigation with Britain.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of expression, of opposition and of conscience is at the core of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting that as well.
Ronan Rafferty hopes his home will be comfortable at the Renaissance Club
Ronan Rafferty, a former European number one, hopes to be at home in the next three days while hosting the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open at the Renaissance Club in South Lothian.
Prior to losing to Paul Eales at Archerfield Links, the Northern Irishman, who leads the next door in the final, feels a new place of commitment and acts as the tournament's founder and CEO on behalf of Jerry Sarvadi.
Rafferty said: “I watched the Renaissance Club being built, and we see that it has come to prominence with this organization.”
The players will see the field in the best way, in a state of fever.
Jerry set up this place and did a really good job.
He is an undisputed defender of this game and is proud of his success here.
That’s a great show for this field.”
Despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour, Eales will fight for the first time in his 32-year career to secure a championship.
The Southport-based actor said, “It feels really special.”
“I didn’t have a chance to defend the Extremadura Open because the next year I won was removed from my schedule.
It's great to be back in this part of the world.
A great place to play golf.
Memories from last year are alive and it was very special to win with me for my wife Sharon last year.
It was a special time in the past and we will always remember it with love.”
Gary Orr, who took part in the European Senior Tour at the age of 50 earlier this year, is returning to the game on his own turf.
The organisation will be the first Scottish competition since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
Helensburgh man Orr said, “When you fight inside, it always means a little more.”
“You want to do good, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and playing basic golf.
I'm glad you're leaving so far."
Participants in this trio were former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among 6 Scots on the pitch; others include Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation is free and parking; <0xC2><0xA3>5 per vehicle with one person and <0xC2><0xA3>10 per vehicle with two or more people.

I found the answer.
Think of a "colt" that... Budget; with 6 billion 867 million Turkish Liras, including Economy, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science Industry and Technology, Environment and Urbanization, Health, Culture and Tourism ministries of eleven ministries each month!
The number of personnel is 117,378.
Turkey's largest "propaganda base!"
Yes, I'm talking about the Presidency of Dianetics!
Yes, I'm going to talk about the President of Dianetics, Mehmet G<0xC3><0xB6>rmez!
I've been looking for answers to the question in my head for days.
I wonder why Mehmet G<0xC3><0xB6>rmez was taken from the chair...
I've read every article about him being sent.
No, I'm not.
I can't find the answer to the question I'm looking for.
At the beginning of this year...
Mehmet G<0xC3><0xB6>rmez has prepared the Strategic Plan of the Presidency of Foreign Affairs (D<0xC4><0xB0>B) 2017-2021.
President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an took the Mercedes model S 600 for 1 million lira.
He had no problem with Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
So what happened?
You might say, "Seven years on duty is not enough."
The first D<0xC4><0xB0>B President M. R<0xC4><0xB1>fat B<0xC3><0xB6>rekci served 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz, whom you all know, sat in that chair for 11 years.
I mean, the president's term is clear.
I ask myself again: Why did Mehmet Seemez leave his seat?
The job's done...
Shii Province
A source close to the power said: "According to the traditional trend, Mehmet D<0xC3><0xB6>nmez's family did not have a birthday party!"
The code of this sentence is this: Sunnah did not exist!
The person who used this phrase whispered behind him: "Modernist was found by the traditional suffrage!"
I mean, Mehmet Immortal was seen as an innovator.
What does innovation mean?
The answer to the problem was hidden in Mehmet G<0xC3><0xB6>rmez's trip abroad.
Date: 27 December 2015.
Mehmet G<0xC3><0xB6>rmez went to Iran to attend the 29th Wahdet Conference, which will be held in Tehran - aiming to bring Islamic mosques closer together.
He met with Ayatollah Ali Hamaney, the religious leader of Iran.
He prayed with the people of Shi'ite religion.
And at the conference, he said, “Mezhep are the fifth schools that have formed over time, representing different ideas and canadas in the understanding of the religion of Islam.”
It is all about the purpose of God’s direction.
Each one is at a distance of a rope leading to the main road, but the place they will arrive is the same.
It is never acceptable to equate mosque worship or to see mosque worship above the Islamic property.
Disturbance based on self is a reflection of the opposite and the opposite of ignorance.
In the case of the mosques, the religion itself has been the most damaging...
I would like to emphasize again by drawing gold here:
Poems and Suns are one nation.
“No one can deny the fact that he perceives Islam as he understands it or does not live it.”
A year later...
Only Caberi leader Salahattin <0xC3><0x96>zg<0xC3><0xBC>nd<0xC3><0xBC>z from Turkey participated in the 30th Currency Meeting.
I mean...
It's not sunny, it's obvious.
Mehmet G<0xC3><0xB6>rmez’s visit to Iran and his speech at the conference made him the target of “traditional fasting.”
This was the absence of anyone representing the Turkish state - again - to the next Tehran conference.
He had not been invited four times since Mehmet Seemez took office.
The reason was obvious; the Shiite in the IDF - the anti-Iran "traditional uprising!"
Immediately after the Iranian trip, Mehmet G<0xC3><0xB6>rmez’s seat began to be demolished from the beginning of 2016.
In the beginning, the deputy prime minister, Numan, who was in charge of the D<0xC4><0xB0>B, had been rescued!
Mehmet G<0xC3><0xB6>rmez was so drowned that he wanted to "connect to the presidency of the D<0xC4><0xB0>B".
It's the essence of...
There was a difference in the view of Sunnis in the state.
The theoretical worlds, as created in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, were likened to the "traditional suffocation", the Sunnah -in the shadow of the U.S. - Vehhabi-Selephilic!
These were Iran’s opponents, who did not even have the Tahrir trip.
It was not surprising that Q<0xC3><0xBC>bbeli Ahmet's words concerning Mehmet G<0xC3><0xB6>rmez: "Diyanet has not been more dangerous than this."
"My Lord, make a journey of good faith to the people of the land, and to the people of the land."
They used "Eligion" as a symbol of Iran's hostility.
For a time, the FET<0xC3><0x96> did -- backed by the CIA -- Iran's opposition was now going by new names.
Also, with FET<0xC3><0x96>'s blades...
A picture of a young man holding a whisky was served to the media with a lie "Son of Mehmet G<0xC3><0xB6>rmez"!
Oh, what a coincidence!
Who made the biggest opposition to Mehmet G<0xC3><0xB6>rmez in the media: the newspaper of the U.S.-sponsored Lightworkers Association Turkey!
In the end...
- Who can't resist the Saudi Vehhabi-Selefi line...
- That doesn't disturb the separation of the mosque...
- Modernist... a religious man was destroyed by the "conscience" created during the Cold War...
U.S. cultural imperialism continues to rapidly Arabize Turkey (to make Vehhabi-Selefi).

China will support Turkey in its efforts to protect its sovereignty, stability and security.
“In the matter of Palestine, we hope that it will be resolved with the international community, including Turkey,” he said.
"In the search for close cooperation with Turkey, regional and international organizations, international organizations are not alternatives to each other, they are complementary," said <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC5><0x9F>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu.
The spiritual begins in the second period.

The meeting is expected to be attended by the Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybek<0xC3><0xA7>i, who represents Turkey.
Security measures at the Cilvegoz<0xC3><0xBC> Border Gate
Human aid, food, medicine and cleaning materials will not be allowed to pass through the Silveg<0xC3><0xB6>z<0xC3><0xBC> Border Gate in the Reyhanli district of Hatay.
According to the information obtained, due to the negative security conditions in the area of the Babel Air Border Gate, located near the Turkish border, the Silveg<0xC3><0xB6>z<0xC3><0xBC> Border Gate was closed to vessels outside humanitarian aid, food, medicine and cleaning supplies.
Aid queues are allowed to exit from the Cilvegoz<0xC3><0xBC> Border Gate.
However, no information was given as to how long the restriction would take.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Land of Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use January when cooking.
He rarely even wears a cap.
The housewife puts a sweet potato, often locally known as a "note", directly on fire, in her wooden house in Enarotali, a restless region of Indonesia in Papua, in the Paniai naip.
Half an hour later, he's getting a medicated punch and he's starving and he's been bitten, he's not washed his hands.
Degei sits on the muddy floor where he does things like washing with muddy water coming from nearby dirt, no furniture.
There's a homeless man in the house who's on a hunting mission.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was never assigned to any field.
Multiplicity is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed and drink a lot, and there are soldiers.
“Nobody goes to the village after 5 p.m.,” he says.
A momentous look at the daily life in the mountainous regions of Papua, a former Dutch colony that Indonesia absorbed in 1969, after a controversial referendum that forced only 1026-year-olds to vote by force before the occupation of the unions.
An existing movement that promotes independence against the Dutch government has quickly turned to the government of Jakarta, which maintains strict control over the region and bans foreign journalists or rights watchdogs.
In 2003, the area was officially separated as Papua and West Papua, where independent Papua New Guinea would occupy the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is; the trip here includes a 90-minute flight from the regional capital Jayapura to Nabire and a 5-hour drive that steals stomachs by rental vehicle.
There's no public transport.
The 19,000-person belt contains wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, with curved iron roofs turned into various yellowish brown tones by rust.
Let the journalists, very few Indonesians have traveled here and almost no foreigners have traveled here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Mee Pago found the Papuans in a god called Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes as well.
Degei, in vivid color, means his hand-touched purple, his dark shirt, and his shiny coat, "We weren't used to wearing these clothes."
"We used to wear only leaves to our bodies."
Papua, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia, is the poorest region in Indonesia.
But this is also the golden land of Indonesia.
Grasberg, the world’s largest and most profitable gold mine owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a mountainous region in the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua is estimated to have $78 billion in search reserves.
What’s more, these riches, which are a source of misery for the Papuans, allow Indonesia’s powerful army to maintain a stifling asset.
The New York Times’ 2005 research reports that Freeport paid local military personnel and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 in bribes given to a single sub.
The Papuans' call for more autonomy threatens this golden-eyed chicken and unmercifully marries its rights.
More than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian army since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned, according to right-wing advocates.
In the mountainous regions of Papua, mass killings in the 1970s reached genocide figures according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators in the region last year alone.
The Brisbane Archbishop's 2016 report "We'll Lose Everything" testifies to the savage suppression of atrocities, such as illegal acts committed last year, torture (according to another report, rape and electrocution particularly popular) and peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to calculate the number of victims every week because there are incidents,” says Andreas Harsono, a researcher at the Indonesian Human Rights Watch.
Papua's resources have been boosted by pressure from Indonesians who have brought settlers from other parts of the country.
The 3.5 million population of the region is 83% Christian, but the majority of Indonesian islands are changing demographics as Muslim migrants from Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi arrive for economic purposes.
Javanese warung buffets sell gado-gado served with roasted chicken and ground peanut sauce mixed with vegetables.
The local people are struggling to compete.
“Suggestors sell chicken and vegetables cheaper in traditional markets than local Papuans,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old local from Paniai, who has moved to the regional capital Jayapura for business.
"This caused the native Papuans to lose the market of Papuan mama-mama (women)."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi, promised to resolve inequalities and violations of rights in Papua in his 2014 election campaign.
As the former manga progresses on its way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, it has taken on 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Panaia.
But very little has changed in Papua, and today the local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that we will achieve our hope that justice will be restored," You said.
In fact, Paniai experienced his worst condition only two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out there singing Christmas songs in front of a festive fire in Enarotali and two Indonesian military darkness broke over the motorcycle.
The frightened kids told them they should open their bells.
One of the soldiers entered his regiment and returned with four soldiers, according to local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Victims and eyewitnesses said they were hunting down a group of soldiers who had taken alcohol and hit their guns with their fists.
Then one of the soldiers fired at the boy group.
One of the 16-year-olds, Julianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he entered the coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government election commission building was set on fire and the next day the events escalated.
Up to 1,000 Papuan men, women and children gathered to demand justice on a football field in front of the local police station and military command center.
They were carrying the T<0xC3><0xB6>rensel hunting spears and performed the waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua (running in folk form and mimicking the bird flu).
Some protesters began to throw stones at the police and military garrison.
As the nerves became even more tense, orders were sent to the soldiers via internal radio: "Kill them by firing more than three times if the crowd shows resistance." An official document, seen by TIME, was said to have not been disclosed to the local media.
Jeremiah Kayame (56), the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and demanded silence by approaching the crowd to return home.
No one wanted to listen.
In the presentation of the brightly colored wooden house, he told TIME, "I was suddenly shot from my left ankle when I turned back."
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from a collected military device.
"It was a crowd, it was fired many times," he adds.
According to his cousin Alfius Youw, who witnessed the attacks, he was shot three times.
John, who, like many Indonesians, is known by only one name, “I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was there.”
"I saw him die... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers had only taken the karakol "under security" because the karakol was under attack.
Pudjo Sulistiyo, deputy chief of police in Papua, said in 2015, “When people threaten to kill us, we have to defend ourselves.”
"It's a matter of survival."
Five young protesters were killed, according to the Human Rights Watch, and many were injured.
The news of the deaths reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, in Jayapura, Jokowi made a passionate speech stating that the victim's family shared the pain and promised to resolve the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he had set up an unwarranted mechanism for historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
“Most of the abuses happened a long time ago.
Some in the 90s and some in the early 2000s.
The point is that we are determined to resolve these violations, but there are processes we need to go through."
Wiranto, speaking to TIME on June 5, took a step back by saying there was no plan to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All will be settled by law."
Wiranto, in which B.M. claimed that 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua, including the Paniai incident, had already been resolved in Papua during East Timor's 1999 bloody independence vote, with more than 1,000 deaths related to "crimes against humanity."
The families of the Paniai victims met with a painful suspicion such claims.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made,” says John.
"I'm tired."
Years later, he says he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by soldiers, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterates his view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by soldiers after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After burying their nests, the soldier came to look for me," he says.
The attacks haven't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on the villagers in the vicinity of Paniai's neighbor Deiyai.
One person died during the clash between the villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help a man who was not in the hospital, including 17 children, who were injured.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned in a nearby lake while fishing, died while going to the hospital.
The angry villagers staged a protest in front of the company's headquarters.
The police said the villagers threw stones at the officers, and they responded by firing a warning.
But the locals say that the moving tuga (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd and killed someone.
The 29-year-old Domingu Badii, who lives close to the hospital and witnesses the injuries being raised, told TIME: “We were panicked, we were afraid revenge would be taken.”
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament called for the officials involved to be held accountable and for the removal of the mobile police force from the area.
Paniai has always been a problematic area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribal peoples living scattered throughout Papua's green mountain centre.
Many of them joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM) in the rebel army, which claims to protect the rights of Papuans by making random attacks and by making kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some top OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya, come from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested, and were taken into custody by soldiers in recent years under the guise of "national sovereignty protection".
Some never see it again.
Among the peoples of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic and forgotten place".
Poverty feeds on dissatisfaction.
The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread can't be reached.
The people here grow everything they eat: basically the note as well as some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of women who can cultivate sweet potatoes with four or five fields.
They usually store most of the proceeds for the family, they sell the rest in the local market.
Ten notes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequalities between the local Papuans and Nabire Airport have increased between more and more new arrivals since the opening of new air routes.
Things that are already less often go to immigrants who are better educated and richer.
It is very rare for Papuans to have capital or necessary classes to carry out their own work as a competitor.
“Young people don’t care to stay in the village because there’s no work or money here,” says John Gobai, head of the Panai tribal council.
Tecrit keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, the restrictions on journalism that exist for the international media are strictly adhered to.
Earlier this year, French journalist Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp were banned from Papua due to a "lack of coordination with relevant institutions" despite the rare video permission given to them.
According to Asia's Deputy Director for Human Rights Watch, Phelim Kine, Jokowi's election campaign did not meet the limits of reporting and development commitments to increase transparency.
In a statement, he said: "There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to get news from Indonesia's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and blacklisting."
The lack of pressure control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is mostly limited to its neighbors near Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) encouraged the B.M. Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, told reporters in Jakarta, "The democratic system in Indonesia still has a valid and free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence in human rights cases."
The locals want more foreign governments to be involved.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands visited Jayapura on May 4 under the country's human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, a source who attended the meeting and did not want his name to be declared, the local people shouted "We want freedom."
Indonesia has yet another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say it is unlikely that they will vote for Jokowi again.
Gobai, the head of the tribal council, said: “Jokowi is a person with good intentions but is turned by people involved in the Paniai attack.”
Jokowi wants the Paniai people to know that apart from living under the approaching threat of a brutal soldier, he is surrounded by pocket education and healthcare.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, also see their vote as a “debt” they give back to Jokowi.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice.”
Despite threats and fears, the families of the victims of the Paniai attack carried out a last-ditch symbolic act: bury a victim's body in the ground opposite the police and military barracks.
They will ensure that those responsible will at least not forget their crimes, knowing that justice can never be done.
"A member of our family has been killed," said Jacobus, bowing his head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire engulfs Dubai’s ‘Meshale’ sky for the second time
A fire in Dubai on Friday swept through the world’s tallest residential towers and forced hundreds of residents to flee the 79-story structure, 337 meters long.
This is the second major fire to spread quickly to a tall building called the Me<0xC5><0x9F>ale Tower in two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and no explanation of the cause of the big fire was made.
“We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm, people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach the 50th floor," a quiet man named George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defense authorities said the fire crew had extinguished the large fire around 4 a.m. local time and was cooling the building.
The government said it was trying to provide shelter for those affected.
This event could bring up questions about the safety of the material used in the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
The investigation conducted by the management of the beehive after the fire in 2015 found that most of the damage was in the exterior panels used for the coating, i.e. for decoration and insulation.
Police in the UK said they believe the insulation and coating panel system on London's Grenfell Tower, where 80 people died, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June.
‘Social assistance’ to more than 4,000 chronic patients
The Ministry of Family and Social Policy will benefit from the social assistance program to be launched for poor citizens and their families who are struggling with chronic diseases, with 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients in the first phase.
With the help program, the Ministry will also provide regular psychosocial support to patients who plan to provide monthly support over two-thirds of the minimum wage.
According to the information obtained, the details and implementation of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Coping with Chronic Diseases", which began work some time ago under the direction of Minister of Family and Social Policy Fatma Bet<0xC3><0xBC>l Sayan Kaya, became clear.
The social assistance program, launched in cooperation with the Ministry of Health in conjunction with the work on chronic diseases, with the aim of supporting citizens living with economic and psychological difficulties, has the feature of being the first in many ways in the world.
The Ministry, which completes all the preparations needed to launch the program, will provide families with a social assistance program not only with cash, but also with regular psychosocial support.
Thus, it is intended that poor citizens who have chronic disease and continue their treatment processes at home and that their families are not left alone both financially and spiritually.
According to the studies, in the first phase, regular psychosocial and cash support will be provided to poor citizens struggling with Subakut Sklerozan Panensefalit (SSPE), a brain disease caused by tuberculosis and measles.
In the advanced stages of the program, poor citizens struggling with other rare and risky diseases will be included in the aid program.
In addition to the support planned to give a ratio of more than two-thirds of the minimum wage, they are unable to take care of themselves, continuing their lives depending on the bed, or the need to improve the living conditions of the home.
The minimum monthly income per person in the household to be able to benefit from the support requires that the monthly net income is less than two-thirds of the monthly net income.
In addition, citizens who are suffering from SSPE need to have a health board report in accordance with the procedure and principles set out in the “Regulation on the Measurement, Classification and Health Board Reports to be given to the Apologies”.
According to the survey, more than 1 in 5 U.S. passengers bring banned substances to the plane.
According to a survey conducted with airline passengers, more than 20 percent knowingly or unknowingly took off prohibited substances from the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency’s checkpoints to the plane, including at least 6 percent carrying unknowingly prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Less than 1 percent later, he claimed to have noticed that he was travelling incorrectly with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The study, conducted by the Jet Charters Jet Rental Service, found that more than 1,000 people were also more likely to break the rules of younger passengers.
Of the participants who admitted to attempting to fly knowingly with something prohibited by the TSA, 19.7% are from the Y-generation, while less than 15 are X-generation members.
The most common substances deliberately abducted from TSA agents are food and liquids.
More than three per cent admitted to using sharp tools from safety, while 2.2 per cent of female participants and 3.7 per cent of male participants admitted to carrying illicit drugs on board the plane.
The company said it had surveyed passengers across the country to find out how many people had mistakenly brought goods from the airport security and how many had done so knowingly.
It’s no surprise that the most likely people to escape security costs knowingly or unconsciously are the ones who fly the most.
Yet, as the firm points out, the TSA rules are a piece of square and confusing.
Most of the time, people are not sure what liquid they can carry or how much of it they can carry.
So it’s no surprise that the largest amount of matter that’s been put into the hands by the TSA comes as prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought that TSA might treat books as a fugitive commodity.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but international flights are not allowed on international flights.
China welcomed U.S. statements in a positive way
China's Foreign Minister Vang Yi told a press conference in Beijing that Tillerson's "regime change, the collapse of the regime, the rapid reunification of the peninsula, and the delay in sending our troops to the north of the 38th parallel".
China's Foreign Minister Vang said Tillerson reiterated the principles of the Washington administration on the North Korean issue, that the United States hopes to implement these principles effectively and effectively in a substantive outcome-oriented policy.
Noting that the security of the Korean peninsula is a priority, Vang said that the parties expected to find a middle way to resolve their concerns through equal dialogue, and that the Beijing administration was waiting for the denuclearization of the peninsula, the preservation of peace and stability, the dialogue and the resolution of the problems.
President of the EPA Pruitt has given up delaying the Obama era’s emissions reduction laws
One day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Organization President Scott Pruitt withdrew his decision to delay the implementation of Obama era laws that lowered previous, bad smoke-causing air pollutant emissions.
Pruitt represented the change as his organization was more responsive to the needs of state environmental regulators than previous administrations.
He never spoke of the legal objection raised against his previous position in a federal high court.
The issue is that states begin meeting October 1, the end of the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that it would postpone its compliance for a year to give its own organization more time to work on the plan and to "interfer to local decisions or prevent economic growth."
Prior to President Donald Trump's appointment, Pruitt, Oklahoma's state attorney general, had long served as a reliable ally against stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly taken action to prevent or delay the regulations against the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday’s sudden change is Pruitt’s latest legal defeat for the resumption agenda.
Last month, a federal high court in Washington ruled that the EPA’s manager was overstepping his authority to try to control and delay the application that requires oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks, an Obama administration law.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt went on to say that the return to ozone standards has strengthened the EPA's commitment to work only on meeting new standards in time with states and through complex processes.
In his previous work, Pruitt, who has sued the EPA more than a dozen times, said: "Under previous administrations, the EPA often fails to meet the latest dates of decisions, waits for activist groups and others to sue, and is reluctant to set deadlines for decisions."
“We don’t believe in regulating through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority it gives us.”
However, the EPA’s statement said Pruitt could once again use “the authority to upgrade and all other legally available authority” to ensure that the regulations are “supported with sound policies and the best available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of ozone laws.
A bill passed last month is seeking to delay the implementation of the 2015 laws for at least eight years.
The advance has not yet been brought to the Senate to vote.
Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: "Following our cases, the EPA's change of decision is a significant gain for the health and safety of more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the bad smoke on New York and its communities."
The case involved New York from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, and other sources that respond to sunlight in the atmosphere are produced when general pollutants are released from the ground-level ozone.
The resulting bad smoke can lead to serious breathing problems in a rapidly affected group of people, and contributes to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applauded Pruitt’s sudden change in decision-making.
Lori Ann Burd, from the Center for Biological Diversity, said: “It’s disturbing that we need so much pressure from the person who is tasked with protecting the air.
“We must continue to fight the Trump administration’s ideological struggle against the fight against environmental pollution and the ideological struggle to make the interests of the people.”
Inflation to the male
Turkey, which achieved its biggest 6-year increase in exports in July, its unemployment rate of 10.5 per cent in January, and the economic confidence index, which rose to its 3.5-year peak, also lowered inflation to a single household.
According to data released by the Turkish Statistical Office (T<0xC3><0x9C><0xC4><0xB0>K) yesterday, the Consumer Price Index (T<0xC3><0x9C>FE) rose 0.15 percent in July, and annual inflation fell to one-time low for the first time since January with 9.79 percent.
According to the main spending groups, in July, the highest increase on a monthly basis was seen in the group of restaurants and hotels, while the group with the highest drop was clothing and shoes with 3.51 percent.
The highest increase on an annual basis occurred in the transport group with 15.24 percent.
In July, Muammer K<0xC3><0xB6>m<0xC3><0xBC>rc<0xC3><0xBC>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu, a Business Investment Economist who noted that inflation is falling in parallel to expectations, said: “In the moderate trend in inflation, food and clothing groups have an impact on prices.”
But in the core indicators, unlike the headline, there is an increase compared to the previous month.
“We don’t expect the Central Bank to have a relaxation in its tight stance,” he said.
Despite the decline in headline inflation, there has been an increase in core inflation indicators.
Of the special comprehensive T<0xC3><0x9C>FE indicators closely monitored by the Central Bank, index B rose from 9.07 to 9.46 in July, and index C rose from 9.20 to 9.60.
Enver Erkan, deputy director of research at Capital FX Research, said inflation could close from 9.3 percent a year, saying: “Inflation could fluctuate by December and fall to a single peak in December.”
“The Central Bank can take the opportunity in the first months of 2018,” he said.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek: He will close the inflation year with a single household.
The tightening of the central bank will continue until inflation falls below 7 percent.
We will finalize the reforms in the upcoming Food Committee.
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci: We are pleased that inflation has fallen to a single-digit figure, but it has to become permanent.
In the fight against inflation, food prices should be reduced as well as consumption increased.
Development Minister L<0xC3><0xBC>tfi Elvan: Due to the base effect in the coming months, there may be a number of upward trends in annual inflation, but from the first months of 2018 the decline in inflation will be noticeable.
We expect annual inflation to fall even lower.
I wish Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e success in his next game.
Sturm Graz Technical Director Franco Foda told UEFA Europa League 3 ahead of the preliminary round that his performance in the second half of the match with Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e was not enough to skip the round.
Speaking at the press conference after the confrontation, Foda said Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e was a top-level team, "We couldn't use the wings in the first half."
We balanced in the second half of the game.
We got a chance for a second goal.
I'm still proud of my team.
They changed the flow of the game in the second half.
We could've been a little better.
The small things in the game were decisive.
"I wish Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e success in his next game," he said.
Foda noted that while they were in Turkey, they felt very well and were also happy because of the hospitality they saw.
Fernando <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul
Fernando Francisco Reges, a Brazilian footballer who started the Galatasaray Club transfer talks, arrived in Istanbul.
The Brazilian footballer, who arrived at Atat<0xC3><0xBC>rk Airport, welcomed the fans in a passionate way.
Fernando, who was shown love by yellow-red fans with cheers and cheers, left the airport with a special vehicle waiting for him under security measures.
Starting his career in Brazil's Vila Nova team, 30-year-old Fernando, who wears the forms Estrela Amadora, Porto and Manchester City, serves in the middle ground.
The Brazilian footballer is expected to sign a contract with the yellow-red team after passing health checks.
Galatasaray, who has continued his transfer work, has signed a deal with Manchester City for his long-term involvement with Fernando for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 million to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>250,000.
Flash Raqqa Movement from the US: Internal Security Force...
Colonel Dillon, who was linked to the U.S. Department of Defense (Pentagon) through video conference management from Baghdad, said the coalition-trained Raqqa Internal Security Force (RIGG) had begun to settle in areas cleared from DEA<0xC5><0x9E> in the city.
“The Raqqa Internal Security Force, composed mostly of Arab and anti-Dea<0xC5><0x9F> local volunteers, continues to ensure order and prevent terrorists from escaping or returning,” Dillon said.
Dillon, who said 230 people had completed further training this week, said that the number of the force in question is 850.
Dillon noted that the coalition had been trained in the group's basic weapon training as well as first aid, armed conflict, screening and control point operations.
Dillon, who told Rakka that his interest in the Internal Security Force was too intense, said the coalition would continue to scan applicants for training and employment.
The U.S.-led coalition is cooperating with the Syrian Democratic Forces, where Rakka is the main backbone of the PYD/PKK.
The PYD/PKK terrorist organization had appointed a PKK terrorist named Leyla Muhammad as the co-chair of the Rakka civilian governing council.
It is also alleged that there will be PKK/PYD members within the military force in Rakka.
Dillon also announced that the U.S.-led coalition, which cut off its support last week, collected heavy weapons from the opposition group Karyateyn (Shuhuk) in Shuheda in southern Syria's El Tanif camp.
Dillon said: “After talking to the leaders last week, the shouk brought back the heavy weapons and equipment that the coalition gave them, but some small weapons and light vehicles were allowed to remain in them.”
The U.S. announced last week that it had withdrawn from the conflict zones it had agreed to with Russia and had been patrolling, and had withdrawn support from Shuhuk on the grounds that it was involved in activities unrelated to the fight against DEA<0xC5><0x9E>.
In addition to DEA<0xC5><0x9E>, the group also says it wants to fight against the regime of Be<0xC5><0x9F>ar Esed.
According to the leaked phone call notes, Trump has pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s phone calls between Mexico and Australian leaders were leaked by the Washington Post.
In a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on January 27, Trump slammed him for not telling the public he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The U.S. president publicly slammed the president of Mexico, who held the wall open to the public, and said, "You can't tell the press."
Trump has launched his presidential campaign to build a wall along the U.S. southern border, promising to pay for the project to Mexico.
Notes from his first interview with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which sparked a heated dialogue, were also published.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the deal the U.S. is going to take refugees to Australia is “masculinity,” “degenerate” and “abuse” and would show itself as “stupid” after the Obama administration proposed a ban on placing a refugee in the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the speech by saying to Mr. Turnbull, "It wasn't the most disgusting speech I've ever had."
The patient broke the doctor's nose.
Doctors and employees of Turkey’s Higher Secondary Education and Research Hospital left a short-term job yesterday morning in order to respond to the beating of a doctor’s friends by their patient relatives.
The crowd gathered in front of the main entrance to the hospital with the motto "No to violence in health" in their hands, reacting to the incident.
Prof. Dr. Feyza Ay<0xC5><0x9F>enur Pa<0xC3><0xA7>, Clinical Head of Children's Cardiology at the hospital, the slogan ""No to violence in health" seems to me to be inadequate even to the sideline slogan."
In health, there is no place for violence.
"If it goes this way, this people will soon not find a health group to serve themselves," he said.
Dr. Kamil T<0xC3><0xBC>rkmen, General Secretary of Ankara First Region Public Hospitals Prof. Dr. <0xC3><0x96>ner Odaba<0xC5><0x9F>, Deputy Head of Higher Education and Research Hospital Prof. Dr. Mustafa Pa<0xC3><0xA7>, gave the hospital a garden with the hospital
The pastor, who condemned the incident, said:
Unfortunately, the violence against health care workers is increasing.
We are reliving an example of this incident yesterday (the day before) last night with our heart surgeon being beaten by a patient close to us.
We demand that our people’s sensitivities on this matter be increased even though we take the measures that we have taken as our state, ministry and government to put an end to these events immediately.
I condemn the events of yesterday on behalf of my hospital and my health workers.
Obadash, who noted that society should be aware of violence in health, said, "Unfortunately, this time has become a professional complication."
"We will also take our own measures, but most importantly, our people will have their own healthcare workers," he said.
T<0xC3><0xBC>rkmen, who noted that the legal process has begun regarding the incident, said: “Our laws on violence in health have been sufficiently effective.”
This is what the state’s standards apply to.
He's doing security work right now.
In the past, these were always empty, but right now there is a direct public case, and the state is hiring a lawyer, following the case.
He used the statement, “There are also severe examples of punishment taken in this regard.”
After the announcements, the employees continued their work.
The incident happened the day before at 5:45 p.m.
In intensive care, the patient's loved ones who lost their lives attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet <0xC3><0x96>zbek, who worked in the Department of Heart and Surgery, which reported death.
Uzbek was removed from the scene by doctors and assistants; police were called to the hospital.
When Uzbek's nose was broken, the attackers were taken into custody.
One of the witnesses to the incident, a doctor, said:
When our friend went to the patient's relatives to report the condition of a patient who lost his life, the patient's relatives held our friend and us responsible and attacked our two friends.
Our friend's nose is broken, he's in the blood.
Then we took our friend to the hospital and hid it.
He pulled a security kit between us for 15-20 minutes.
If the sick loved ones had crossed that security wall, there would have been a lot worse things.

YPG rain in Syria...
The U.S. intervened
According to information obtained by the AA from local sources, YPG terrorists raided the homes of residents of the Tel Semin district in the northern village of Rakka, where the terrorist organization entered the US military support for fighting DEA<0xC5><0x9E>.
The reaction of the civilians who looted and laid hands on their homes turned into a conflict with the terrorist organization.
After that, U.S. forces in the region entered the field with armored vehicles.
"Cougar MRAP" type armored vehicles, personnel carriers, and Husky type mine-determining vehicles were found to form buffer zones in the range.
The terrorist organization YPG does not allow civilians fleeing death in Rakka, which is under fire under the scope of the DEA<0xC5><0x9E> operation, to enter the cities under control.
A local activist network called Raqqa is being quietly killed announced yesterday that 121 civilians were killed in the organization's artillery fire in July alone.
Let's not carry the old world's battles to tomorrow
The delayed perception of the realities of the country and of the world can cause not only individuals but also countries to be dragged into crises.
One of the reasons for the backward perception of the world realities of the East, which we refer to as "sharkness", may be the fact that these realities are blocked by certain rooms, or that they are announced in a way that is beyond reality.
Don Kisot and Oblomov have also been subject to the literary world of late detection or never detection.
The "Don Quixote" of Cervantes is a match that still makes itself a knight when the bourgeoisie begins to form.
Or Gon<0xC3><0xA7>arov's "Oblomov" is a tenuous legacy that thinks everything can last as long as it ignores the facts.
For example, by the end of the 15th century, when China was open to the world and a country dominated the seas, a holding dynasty was shut down as a result of the crossing of the wood.
This was until the captains of the ships that went out of China's waters were executed.
We Turks, who have one foot, one eye and one ear in the West, the other foot, one eye and one ear in the East, have experienced constant doubts about perceiving the facts and the change, starting with the Ottomans.
We tried to move our old and new chapter yesterday to today, to understand today with concepts that conform to the old conditions, to think tomorrow.
One part of us was able to act as quickly as we can in developed countries to perceive both the realities of the world and the realities of change.
This has been a source of constant conflict and tension.
The university with Medrese, the modern army with its youth, the encounters of doubt with faith, caused a dramatic slide in content.
Progressivity is even worse, and it is not accepted that new and advanced attitudes will, at the end of certain periods, be obsolete and that they will remain behind.
Today’s progressives, after a period of time, began to declare the new and the advanced “Dangerous”, and those who tried to interpret the conditions of the country and the world in a way that was consistent with the current reality, “Hain”.
The most important lesson in the Ottomans was that the empire was broken up, collapsed, and the people became impoverished as they came to grips with the idea and rule of the state life by delaying the realities of the country and the world.
The most important lesson our Ottoman past conveys to the Republic was the fact that the rapid perception of world conjuncture and change was an inevitable prerequisite for survival.
Since this course was very well self-governing, we could have been the example country of this geography, which was able to maintain its unity, integrity, stability in peace from World War I until now.
In order for us to survive the process of global change that has entered into a different approach, we need to leave behind the excuses and act in accordance with the facts.
In other words, there will be no benefit to anyone from bringing the meaningless encampments and blood cases that have led to the accumulation of our democracy in the past.
Moreover, the smallest mistakes in today’s world lead to very large and dramatic crises.
The most difficult geography in this regard is the Middle East we are in.

Winds in Turkey
The global giants, confident in Turkey’s future, fought back against the thunderstorm that broke out in yesterday’s wind farm victory.
The World Record was broken in the protest against the model set by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources to reduce its dependence on the outside world to ensure national energy transition.
A $1 billion investment and nearly 4,000 jobs have also opened the way with a bid to lower Turkey’s energy costs.
By 2019, local production of wind turbines will be included in the system.
Eight consortiums, including U.S., Chinese, German and Danish giants, participated in the wind power plant licensing ceremony, which was opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (YEKA).
In the lawsuit, financial tenders were opened in order to determine the 5 bidders who initially gave the lowest bid.
After the first round of bids, the lowest bid was $4.19/kilowatt-hour.
The open deceleration range was set to 0.01 cents.
After the referendum began, Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas decided not to participate in the open exclusion of the joint venture groups.
In the open race, Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed.
Following the withdrawal of Nordex’s consortium, MingYang-First Construction and Siemens-T<0xC3><0xBC>rkler-Kalyon remained the last two.
MingYang-First Construction took a break 11 times.
The Siemens-T<0xC3><0xBC>rkers-Kalyon Energy Consortium never took a break.
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak: a record day for Turkey.
The open skirmish continued for 30 laps.
The winner of the intense clash between the two consortiums was the Siemens-T<0xC3><0xBC>rkerler-Kalyon joint venture group, which offered the lowest bid of $3.48 cent/ kilowatt-hour.
While the consortium offered $3.49 in the auction, the auction commission under the chairmanship of Vice-Chancellor Alparslan Bayraktar drew the bid to $3.48.
With the result of the two-hour siege of YEKA, Turkey achieved a world record.
The proposed kilowattage of $3.48 per cent has gone down in history as the lowest figure in the world in this area.
The previous record was held by Mexico at $3.84 per kilowatt-hour.
The Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak, who held the press conference following the conclusion of the protest, said that the victory of the German company Siemens was an important message to the region and to the world, “In terms of the 200 years of historical cooperation between Turkey and Germany, we are looking at the outcome of this.
Our goals are big.
The resulting economy and energy market, which emerged today, has shown how robust and confident it is going with steps towards the future.
No matter how many regional crises there are in the world, I am very proud to announce that Turkey is at the forefront of the region and the world’s most dependable investment countries.
"In this picture, we will be proud of Turkey as 80 million, the biggest contribution, within its 15-year power and leadership, is our President, who has brought Turkey to this point," he said.
Albayrak, who stated that they have launched a new era with clear, transparent and comparative competition, said: "One of the most important steps of this is to reduce the cost of the world by $ 10.3 per kilowatt-hour per kilowatt-hour share in the wind until yesterday, at a cost of $ 3,48 per cent.
I am proud of this, on behalf of my people, for my country.
Minister Albayrak said that the first domestic production panels in solar power are intended to be implemented before the end of 2018, "I hope we will include our domestic production wind turbines into the system by the end of 2019."
Turbines will be installed in 5 designated areas.
The company, which won the competition, will receive a total of one thousand megawatts of installed wind power in each of these 5 regions, with the condition of establishing a wind power of at least 50 megawatts.
The total investment to be made by the Siemens-T<0xC3><0xBC>rkers-Kalyon group will be over $1 billion.
With local wind power plants entering the business, at least 3 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity will be generated each year and about 1.1 million homes will be met with annual electricity needs from the wind.
Thanks to the wind farms to be set up, an average reduction of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2/year will also be provided.
The company that won the competition will build the factory with investments of over $100 million.
The plant will produce an average of 300 to 450 local wind turbines, with a capacity of at least 2.3 megawatts.
The consortium will carry out R&D work in at least three of the areas of wing, generator design, material technologies and manufacturing techniques, software and innovative gear boxing for a total of 5 years.
With a budget of $5 million each year for R&D work, 50 technical staff of 80 percent of local engineers will work.
The factory will be established 21 months after the signing of the contract.
The duration of the project is 30 years.
Kaz<0xC4><0xB1>m T<0xC3><0xBC>rker, Chairman of the Management Board of Turkish Construction, which is located in the consortium that won the award, said that local production will be around 64 percent in the project, 35 percent of the equipment will come from abroad, from foreign sources.
The Turkish said the pledge reflects confidence in the Turkish economy.
Kalyon Holding Energy Group President Murtaza Ata said: “It was a pledge to reduce Turkey’s external dependence by a thousand megawatts.
"We're happy with the result," he said.
Siemens Gamesa Turkey Senior Manager Hakan Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m also said that they have been operating in Turkey for 160 years, “We will do everything we can to further reduce the cost of the electric unit”.
The locality rate of wind turbines to be produced in the factory will be at least 65 percent.
65 percent of the 8,000 industrial parts in the wind turbine will be domestic (at least 5,200 pieces).
A facility of at least 50 MW will be installed in each of the 5 regions, with a total of 1000 MW.
3,750 people will have 10 years of R&D obligation to spend $5 million on R&D activities every year
1.000MW Wind Power Plant Production of 300 to 450 local wind turbines at a capacity of at least 2.3 MWe with a 65% locality Ratio.
Investment of over $1 billion per year 400 MW/year of wind turbine production capacity of over $100 million factory investment.
Electricity production, which will meet the needs of approximately 1.1 million homes, will produce at least 3 billion kWh of electricity each year, an average reduction of 1.5 million tons of CO2/year of emissions.
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Resurrect the Iraq Link Event for Call to Justice
A 1948 model Ford Mercury was passed through a group of spectators in the village of Monroe Georgia and advanced a narrow bend towards the small Ford Bridge in Moore.
The car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, came forward to close the path of a group of armed white men before reaching the bridge.
He took a long breath from the leader's cigar of the gang, a man in a middle-aged thin-line suit, and looked carefully inside the front window.
Inside, the seats were torn away with fear.
"That's what we want, Roger!" exclaimed the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
A young black man was pulling out of the front passenger seat, screaming in the dark.
Fortunately, this horrifying scene, which was played on June 22, is just a re-enactment.
But when a scientist was thrown around Roger's neck, almost everyone in the audience breathed quite realistically.
Since 2005, human rights defenders have returned to the Ford Bridge in Moore to revive the lynchings of two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far, no one has been charged with murder.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the revival, said: “We see them in our communities and we know who they are, but it doesn’t make sense that one person hasn’t been arrested all these years.”
"It's a stain on this date, but a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong human rights advocate.
For him, this revival, a dramatic call for action, and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that injustice has never been corrected.
He said: “We want to be repulsed, we want results, we want wounds to be wounded, we want compromise, but we have to get justice first.”
"We can't have the wound wrapped up and the reconciliation justice."
On July 27, 1946, the court placed a plate on the body of one of the victims of the Ford line in Moore.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, Monroe and more than 50 men were suspected of lynching from surrounding areas.
But one of them has never been investigated.
Although the suspects remain fugitives for decades, human rights defenders say the twin motivations of the lynx are always well known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a high court ruling made it possible for black citizens in Georgia to vote in the pre-election at the end of that summer for the first time.
According to the FBI, at almost the same time as the election, black partner Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, who owns a white land, apparently in relation to a woman during a fight.
Brooks stated that the saying in the town was that Hester was sleeping with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, Loy Harrison, a leading white landowner on July 25, 1946, paid $600 to get Malcolm out of prison.
Dorothy and her cousins, Mae Murray, went to prison with George Dorsey.
But when they arrived at the Ford Bridge in Moore, a gang of lynchings surrounded the car.
An FBI report concludes, "It is clear that it was Harrison who arranged the murders and ordered them."
"It is also clear that there was a secret agreement between the state and local law enforcement that not only did they take part in the crime, they destroyed the evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses of the sight."
Brooks was shorter and self-explanatory.
He said, “This is my right to vote.”
“They were all killed to send a message to the black people in this society: ‘If you register and vote, that’s what’s going to happen to you.’ ”
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has been leading the revival of the Ford Bridge lynchings in Moore, which takes place every year.
Its performance takes into account all the details, it’s attention-grabbing, and it’s based on a kind of deep racism that many no longer believe exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and it's even harder to turn your eyes around, but Greene says that's what it's all about.
He said, "We don't want to talk about the lynching because it's all smothering us with the filth inside us."
"But if you don't listen to me or you don't listen to what's happening to me, I can't develop a relationship with you."
This year’s production rehearsals began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest black) filled a room and listened when Greene entered the well-proven general lines of the game.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's assistant director.
He has played the role of President Klansman for years, but he says the role has never been easier.
Marbaugh said, "I feel trapped because that's not me."
“But I think it’s important to keep this past alive because we don’t want to go back to those times.”
Actors who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester throughout the room were Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona trying their own lines.
Malcom starts the game by yelling at Hester, where he's so angry that he's sleeping with his wife Dorothy.
"Z...i, get out of my property!"
Rascona reacts.
There's a gunshot.
And then everyone (at least black actors) drowns in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
Rascona asked, "What?"
He was excited, surprised.
Am I too hard?
Greene said "No" in the cracks.
“I just don’t think white people would say z.”
One of the black actors threw a mixed stone with a joke, saying "Yes."
"You have to press 'R."
So the energy in the room changes and some kind of intimacy takes the place of unrest.
Everyone is dedicated to doing it right, not only for the line of play but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time Rascona says the word starting with N, sharp and accentuated.
Absolutely no one is laughing.
The resurgence ends in a violent and rapid manner.
Screams, gunfire, and then there's silence.
A woman on the funeral list stands on the bodies of the actors and reads Billie Holiday's sad meth "Garip Fruit."
The voice breaks in one of the two words.
A hundred yards behind, an average of four dozen spectators wipe their sweat and tears from their eyes.
The viewer is almost equally divided into being black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many of the way forward.
While Brooks led them on a sacred journey to the graves of the Malcoms and Dorseys, they were all based on Georgia's oppressive waters for almost eight hours.
To this point, the killings remained an anecdote, but now standing in the same place where the lynching is, it means that the weather sounds like hell.
As the song's final notes weaken, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and examine their bodies.
The children are rotting on their hands, swallowing fake blood and motionless bodies and whispering to each other.
It's as if a little boy remembers himself saying, "They're not really dead."
A few minutes later, Greene thanks the crowd and suddenly it's over.
Actors throw lynching needles and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw is tied to Marbaugh, the team-mate who plays President Klansman.
Nick Rascona hangs out with two of his playmates, and tears fall from his eyes, and the emotional cost of performance finally comes to him.
One of the women whispers, "No problem."
“We know that’s not what’s in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience sat down to dinner with the actors.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chats passionately about reviving with a black couple.
Denise Duplinski finds it difficult to find words about how her performance makes her feel.
He said, “These horrible, horrible words, and those behaviors... come from people like you, and they do this because they look like you.”
"What this does to me is to think that the lynchings are still going on," he added, "they're now just called police armed attacks."
At the end of the room, she's interested in eating dinner at the Tyrone Brooks table and sharing her memories of human rights.
He said he’s already starting to plan for next year’s performance.
He said: “Improvement is inspiring in a way because it describes what we’ve folded into, but also the teacher.”
"It's like, if you don't learn from it, it might happen again.
Those who do not research their own past, those who do not know their own past, are doomed to repeat it."

Special website for Congress from the AK Party
by the AK Party, 6.
A website called “Akkongreler.com” was set up for the current Congress process.
On the website, the brochures, materials and views that the party organization will use in this process are provided.
In the ‘Communication Strategy’ section of the site, the rules to be adhered to in the congress process are listed in Chapter 14.
The President and President of the AK Party, Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, posted on his website, warned the members of the organization that they would conform to the party’s corporate identity during the congress process.
In his message, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an said, "Now we are starting a new era of reprisal."
We need to be renewed and refreshed to achieve our 2023 goals with stronger steps.
"As yesterday, we should continue to work on the shoulder, hand and hand tomorrow," he used the statement.
Pearson did more than 3000 jobs to revive the business, cut its share of snow
As the British education group Pearson began another restructuring program to cope with the pressures the business faced, he said he would do more work on Friday and cut the interim profit share by 72 percent.
According to Chief Executive John Fallon, withdrawals from work that will mostly be completed by the end of 2018 and the end of 2019, will add to the 4,000 positions lost in the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced a plan that would save another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) by trying to quickly learn digital with a third cost-cutting program.
The firm, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said it had not changed its outlook this year after reporting its core sales in the first half with a 1 percent increase of <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Text 2 is dead again!
According to the first report of the Judicial Medical Agency, the death was suicide, according to the first findings in Hakan's preliminary autopsy report.
In the detailed examination, no pulse and cerebellum were found in the child's body.
The reason for the suicide is that the elastic band around the neck is numbed as a result.
It was also determined that the bandage, which his family identified as a bandage, was the elastic bandage used in injuries.
According to the newspaper Habert<0xC3><0xBC>rk, after the preparation of a detailed report on the death of the child, it was learned that the report, which stated that the incident was suicide, would be sent to the Grand Republic Prosecutor's Office, which is conducting the investigation.
While the police are investigating the child's suicide in all the details, they are conducting investigations on his computer after the incident.
It was also reported that the police would appeal to Hakan's friends.
It is also stated that their relatives can access third parties or a gang with the information to be obtained from Hakan's computer, which he says is "cleaned up."
The police are assessing Hakan as being dragged by a suicide squad.
The absolute victory of Hakan's suicide turned his eyes into the "Metin2" that contained violence.
Responding to the cause of child dependence and violence, last year, the text, which was banned by the Antalya government for children under 15, came to light with the killing of the 13-year-old "mini-hacker" Textin Kang, in 2009.
In order to play Text2 designed in Korea in 2005, it is necessary to log in and register a member.
Players try to provide peace and justice in the world with the dragon god in the game.
In doing so, wars are taking place, and the dose of violence is increasing.
In the game, there are images of war, such as lines, swords, shovels, axes, cutters, and mad weapons, as well as images of people being torn apart by wild animals, where their flesh is defeated.
The player buys characters with money to be strengthened.
The family who gave their children to the ground the next day after the incident took place at the house in K<0xC3><0xB6>knar Sokak in Esenyurt <0xC4><0xB0>stiklal Mahallesi, K<0xC3><0xB6>knar Sokak.
While Baba Mehmet Ekinci said, "The whole dream was to be a doctor, we don't think it could hurt him or anyone else because of the game," he said, "They put the elastic wrap around his neck and threw the knot side by side."
That's how it was found, son.
We certainly don’t think our son can harm himself or anyone else because of a game over the internet.
We knew he was playing such a game.
It wasn’t a game he was playing.
Let's just say he quit the game when he got a little bored.
Mother G<0xC3><0xBC>lizar Ekinci said, “There is no one inside the building.”
It is said that at a certain hour my child entered the house.
None of them hold each other.
There was only one chair when his brother came home.
"But when there was a funeral, there were two chairs next to the computer," he said.
First off, he may have been infected with the virus.
Families generally don’t pay attention to this.
They look at me with their own eyes no matter what happens at home.
The child communicates with a lot of people through games.
There may have been a situation of borrowing a loan, or of refutation.
Or he invited a person in the game home, which could have been a problem between them.
It may have been affected not by direct play but because of problems with other people he has been in contact with through play.
The visuals of the game, the foundation of the child may have been considered real.
It could be about the suicide-wracking trauma.
If the child is faced with a situation of complaint to the family, there is a situation of drag-and-drop because he cannot solve this problem.
He couldn't have committed suicide because of the game.
The child's chances of getting into a gang are also high.
He may have been in the chain.
Individually, there is nothing the child could have done alone.
Information systems consultant F<0xC3><0xBC>sun NEB<0xC4><0xB0>L: Families should know the interaction of their children
We can't say games are harmful.
Research has also shown that games are useful for the development of children.
The important thing here is that parents pay attention to what their children are playing and how they talk to players online.
Parents should avoid knowing how their children are affected by what content.
In Turkey, there are only two children in 5 years who are said to have died because of the game.
This shows that ending a child’s life is not just the effect of games.
What's the matter with this kid?
We need to find out first.
We need to look at the sociology and psychology around the child.
The stock market in Istanbul stood at 50 percent for 8 months
The BIST 100 index continued its upward trend, which began in December 2016, in July and moved its upward rise to the 8th month at the top.
Thus, the index gained 45.3% for the first time since July 2007 when it recorded a rise above 8 months in this period.
The BIST 100 index, which has left behind Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan’s major stock exchanges since the beginning of the year, did not leave the lead on the basis of returns in July.
The BIST 100 index, which was up 7.06 percent in July, followed the Dow Jones index in the US by 2.54 percent, followed by the FTSE 100 index in the UK by 0.81 percent.
With the DAX index in Almaya, the Nikkei index in Japan completed the month of July with a loss of value.
Looking at the January-July period, it was seen that the BIST 100 index displayed a high performance from both major world exchanges and developing country stock market indexes.
This year, the BIST 100 index, which gained 37.6 percent at the end of 2016, followed the Dow Jones index with 10.76 percent increase, the DAX index with 5.55 percent gain, the Nikkei index with 4.55 percent increase, and the FTSE 100 index with 3.21 percent increase.
The MSCI EM index, which is indicative of emerging markets in the developing countries, yielded 23% returns.
When looking at the historical process of the BIST 100 index, it was found that it showed similar performance in the past.
The latest BIST 100 index, which peaked for 8 months between December 2006 and July 2007, recorded a 38.3% increase during this period.
The BIST 100 index was also completed on August 8, 1996, March 8, 1997, and May, 1997, and January, 1998.
Eren Can <0xC3><0x9C>m<0xC3><0xBC>t, Director of Investment Research at Meksa, told the AA reporter that the BIST 100 index has continued to rise for 8 months, recording that since the beginning of the year it has exceeded 37 percent of the increase.
Overall, MSCI noted that the emerging markets (EM) index recorded a 23 percent increase, even when we looked at these rates, indicating that there was a positive divergence:
The flow of funds to developing countries has continued since the beginning of the year.
In particular, funds within the search for high returns are preferred by countries that give higher interest rates.
As a result, domestic markets are positively impacted.
Of course, the appetite for risk taking on a global scale is also quite high.
As a result, stock indexes in risky asset status are declining.
In the U.S., the S&P 500 index has been tested almost every week in parallel to an increase of close to 11 percent since Christmas.
At the beginning of the year, the U.S. central bank’s (Fed) 3% increase forecasted markets were under stress, but the Fed noted that there was a market that was not sensitive to the Fed’s interest increase by using the Fed’s policy of verbal guidance rather well.
Overall, the U.S. has stated that inflation is not yet at the desired level, that the Fed will not act hastily on interest rate hikes and that its expectations of avoiding radical moves are also quite effective at current prices.
If US President Donald Trump can’t cancel health reform known as “Obamacare”, say he’s strengthening his perception that expanding financial policies won’t fulfill his promises, say, “The faster Trump’s growth, the faster the U.S. economy will be, and the stronger the stock markets will be.”
In terms of Turkey's markets, he noted that 2016 was a year of many negatives, saying that it was in an effort to close the gap between the negative divergent and oversold BIST 100 index.
Noting that they did not see a strong recovery with the domestic news stream, General noted that the current view could be interpreted as triggering the desire to close the gap, according to the similarities of domestic markets, with an increase in the appetite for risk taking more abroad.
Overall, he recorded a number of earnings sales in the BIST 100 index, which tested new records at 108,600 levels, as follows:
In particular, 109,500-110,000 areas are critical in the short term.
After approaching these levels, it is normal for the sales to take place.
In the short term, we think there should be a new local or global story for pricing over 110,000.
For now, the downturn in 107,500 support could trigger sales of profits.
If we follow the 107,000 call support in this case, I think we can see the relaxation up to 106,000-105,500.
In particular, the collapse of the 105,500 support could lead to a retreat to 104,300 levels, which is equivalent to 50 percent of the Fibo increase from 100,000 to 108,600 levels.
Overall, both the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) have indicated that their decisions will be the focus of the global market, and that expectations for the Fed are already clear, but they are not expected to increase interest rates at the FOMC in September.
Overall, this situation could trigger profit sales in the developing country (GO<0xC3><0x9C>) stock indexes in the short term, noting "what the ECB is going to say is what is really important next."
After the July Monetary Policy Board meeting, ECB President Mario Draghi said he would discuss the course of monetary policy in the autumn, which led the euro/dollar pair to rise above 1,1700 levels.
Therefore, the announcements that the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion monthly asset purchase programme will be reduced or may be terminated will also mean that the post-Fed liquidity will be reduced by the ECB on a global scale.
“Therefore, negative pricing on behalf of the country markets, which offer high current rates, such as Turkey, and which require access to external funds, can lead to negative prices,” he said.
Erol G<0xC3><0xBC>rcan, director of the Gedik Investment Advisory Board, said that in November 2016, after Trump was elected president of the United States, there was a very serious rally in terms of global stock markets.
G<0xC3><0xBC>rcan noted that it is possible to say that the fundamental element that triggers this rally movement is increasing global growth expectations, including Trump’s pledges to lower taxes initially:
The Istanbul Stock Exchange was also at the forefront of the emerging markets in the global rally.
While one of the most important reasons for this is that the BIST 100 index has remained fairly discounted compared to the developing country markets in recent years, it is worth saying that the steps taken by policymakers towards supporting the economy and financial markets have also played a serious role.
In particular, we can say that the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF) index, which became active as of March, has a serious impact on the so far observed rise.
For the rest of the year, however, G<0xC3><0xBC>rcan reported that positive developments were reflected in significant price increases and that KGF, which has an important role in this increase, has also slowly reached saturation, although the BIST 100 index is still declining compared to similar country markets.
The 180-day action plan, which has been expected to share Georgian details for a particularly long time, can contribute positively to the development of developments such as the increase in the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, in this sense.
As a result, the Fed, the ECB, and the Bank of England have become more and more advanced, and the central banks have become more and more and more, while the current expansionary monetary policy is slowly becoming more and more difficult, it has become more and more critical for developing countries.
In the next period, G<0xC3><0xBC>rcan said that in the possible correction movements at the index, the region of support 104.150-104.600, which corresponds to the 200-hour moving average, is quite critical in the case of the break of this support zone, up to 100.000 corrections in the case of the 100.000 movement.
G<0xC3><0xBC>rcan stated that if the current upward trend is maintained and the current historical peak level of 108,605 resistance is broken, the index could rise to between 110,000 and 112,000.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO killed in military suicide attack
According to officials, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and wounded several.
In a statement, NATO said five soldiers and one translator were wounded.
Unaudited local sources say three civilians were killed in the incident in the Karabakh region of the city.
The bombing was the last act of violence in Afghanistan this month; more than 30 people died in a glass explosion in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement on Thursday evening that it had been attacked by a "personally guided hand-made bomber" in a joint patrol mission with the Afghan army.
The statement said all the injured were in good condition and were being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
Reporters say the Taliban's growing power and the group known as Islamic State (IS) in the Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces, which is spoken near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, Afghanistan witnessed the death of at least 1,662 civilians, an average of 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in the mostly Shiite area of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On May 31, 2001, after U.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power, the country’s deadliest militant attack killed more than 150 people in a massive bombing incident in the city centre.
The act of violence underscores the unstable security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump puts emphasis on increasing and not increasing the number of U.S. troops assisting the military and police in the country.
Journalists say that suicide bombings in Kabul have led to a crisis in the government, its policies, and especially in the public confidence of President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA has given up delaying the dirty weather rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Organization (EPA), an Obama-era law, has returned from its decision to delay the law requiring states to block emissions from causing bad smoke, with 15 states filing a lawsuit a day later.
The EPA said late on Wednesday that the organization was showing determination to work with states, saying it would continue with the “2015 Ozone Decisions.”
In a statement, EPA President Scott Pruitt said, “We believe in dialogue with our state partners and be sensitive to them.”
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's intention to delay its ozone decisions for a year until October 2018; with these decisions, the current dirty smoke pollution is being measured in various parts of the country, and it is deciding where to discontinue to meet more stringent air quality standards.
With 15 mostly Democratic states, the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit on Tuesday that said the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is continuing its search to reclaim the vast array of environmental regulations brought to life by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump is calling to revitalize economic growth.
But these efforts led to the reaction of conservative groups concerned about the impact of Democrats and more emissions on public health.
The EPA’s website says that ozone-containing air breathing can “decrease lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma.”
The forest gave us the news...
The line stops and the wing transfers!
Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> President Fikret Orman made statements to Bein Sports about the transfer of the Dutch footballer Jeremain Lens and the stoper.
Mind Forest said these things...
There is no surprise in the transfer.
Our goal is not much transfer, but point shooting.
Now we're going to make a stop and wing transfer.
We have Champions League games, hopefully we'll make a good bet.
We have to make a forced wing transfer.
10 million euros is very easy, but we don’t have such a budget.
If it comes to the budgets we're talking about, we're gonna transfer, or we're not gonna die.
I can't tell you anything about the lens before it clears up.
We are an open company.
The end of patience is salutation.
Is the Isis threat only for August 30th not for the festival?
The Government of Ankara continues to respond to the ban on all mass events, including sit-ins, memorial gatherings and so on, on the grounds of the "ISIS threat" during the month of August.
While the government's ruling prohibits the expression "all collective activities", 7 in Ankara.
The Ankara International Grand Festival is still going on.
Levent G<0xC3><0xB6>k, Chairman of the CHP Group and Ankara National Representative, told S<0xC3><0x96>ZC<0xC3><0x9C> that "the impact of the August 30 bans cannot be at all" and said:
He's got a serious headache.
Even the government has doubts as to what decision it will implement...
The task of the state is to create areas to celebrate the holidays.
"All Ankara has a security problem, only G<0xC3><0xB6>k<0xC3><0xA7>ek's organizations have no security problem," said Murat Emir, an Ankara MP.
Ankara's Independent National Representative Aylin Nazl<0xC4><0xB1>aka moved the ban to Parliament.
In response to the Prime Minister’s request, Nazl<0xC4><0xB1>aka said, “Does this ban clearly expose the AKP’s republican and Atat<0xC3><0xBC>rk hostility? How do you intend to prevent the millions who will celebrate in the fields on August 30?”
"I've learned from Edwina herself that I've been cheated on."
Demet <0xC5><0x9E>ener, who continued the divorce case with Ibrahim Kutluay, was with his lawyer Asl<0xC4><0xB1> Hatemi and Ni<0xC5><0x9F>anta<0xC5><0x9F>a the previous day.
Shener, who opened a spiritual compensation case with Edwina Sponza claiming to have destroyed her home, presented Sponza and Kutluay's photographs to the court as evidence.
The sociologically beautiful Sponza was also found in the crime notice about Shener, saying, "Demet illegally took my private photos."
“I don’t know what I’m doing.”
After this latest development, <0xC5><0x9E>ener, who met his lawyer at the Delicatessen, saw the journalists and walked out of the room.
When she recalled Edwina Sponza’s claim about the photos, she laughed, “God, I must have gone in and taken it home.”
In fact, Hatemi de Sponza's complaint was, "There is such a complaint, but the content is not correct."
"We have everything in our hands; we have presented it to the court," he said.
Shener told reporters, "In recent times, everyone knew your wife's relationship with SpongeBob."
"How did you not know?" he was surprised at the question.
What's that?
How's that?
"I couldn't swear," said Shener, "would I believe my husband, who looked into my eyes, or the dichotomy of the alalem?"
When asked by reporters, Sener, who said "No," insisted, "Have you never heard?", he continued, "I didn't hear it, of course, I heard it for the first time."
But I never believed in anything like that.
Everything was normal, it was on the spot; there was nothing to suspect.
Ma'am, when I sent everything in my hand, I learned everything, so...
"Was he the one who sent the evidence?" asked Sponza, "Yes," and S<0xC3><0xA8>ner, who answered "Yes," shrugged his head well, claiming that the photograph and inscriptions he had submitted to the court had been sent by Sponza himself.
Sponza had previously claimed that his writings were montage with Ibrahim Kutluay.

Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> Club will include Spanish footballer Alvaro Negredo in his official squad tomorrow.
The signing ceremony at Vodafone Park will be held for Negredo, which Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> has agreed to transfer to Spain's Valencia Club.
The signing ceremony, which will also be attended by Club President Fikret Orman, will be held at 12 noon.
Meanwhile, the Spanish footballer will also undergo health check tomorrow morning.
Qatar: We broke the embargo in hours thanks to Turkey
Qatar's Minister of Economy and Trade Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani said he wanted to convey his thanks to the people of Turkey.
Al Thani: "Thank you very much for your respectful attitude and the support you have given us."
My brother, President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, sends greetings to the Emirate of Qatar.
Qatar's economy has shown resistance.
In many countries, while economies are negatively impacted, our economy remains stable.
In order for Qatar to be independent and strong, we must work with our strength.
We broke the embargo made against us within hours thanks to Turkey.
We have no shortage of things right now.
Our natural resources support Qatar’s economy a great deal of natural gas exports.
We have not been affected by the blockade against us, which was cruelly carried out and against the laws, thanks to Turkey.
Today, Qatar is once again producing natural gas and LNG around the world.
“After the living, we experienced a 30 percent increase, not a drop in our natural gas exports,” he said.
Al Thani noted that the work continued in all areas with the fraternal relations between Qatar and Turkey, "a volume of $554 million was created in the first quarter of the trade volume between us."
Decisions made in the last period have played an important role in this.
As a result of Turkish products proving themselves in the Qatari market, it is extremely important for us to accelerate the entry of goods from Turkey in all sectors, and to make investments in many areas.
"Thank you very much for your constructive attitude towards us," he said.
The cost of the last disasters 300 million TL
The TSB President Can Ak<0xC4><0xB1>n <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar reported to the insurance companies after the flood on 18 July, received 7 thousand damage reports of 116 million TL, received 12 million lira in the G<0xC3><0xB6>kova earthquake on 21 July, received 800 damage reports of 12 million lira in July, and received on 27 July on the 16 July in Istanbul
"The damage caused by the car that is full from the insurance of the helmet is 3,500 pounds per vehicle, and the glass damage is around 1,000 pounds."
“In the earthquake, the average housing damage is 6 thousand lira,” he said.
Highlighting that they have spent intensive efforts as a sector to compensate for economic losses, Can Ak<0xC4><0xB1>n <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar said that 3 out of 4 people do not have housing insurance, one out of 2 businesses do not have fire insurance, and 2 out of 3 people do not have helmet insurance, saying that they are sorry:
Due to the low level of insurance in our country, the risk of facing the serious costs of damage to our citizens and institutions is increasing every day.
All these costs should not be left over by the state.
Insurance policy is not as expensive as it is thought, but insurance is not only a sector that pays damages; it also does risk management consultancy.
Increasing awareness of insurance and the rate of insurance is very important for our people and our country.
“Casko insurance generally states that insurers should report their damages within 5 business days, and this period ended yesterday,” he said.
“Will the insured be the victim?” he replied: “Although there is such a period of time in the General Terms and Conditions, the time limit in the Trade Act is 2 years.”
“Also, these events are a natural disaster, so the insurers don’t have to panic, they don’t say I don’t pay any companies,” he said.
That's how the German media saw the big deal!
During a period of growing tensions between Turkey and Germany, the German company Siemens has noted that Turkey’s first Wind Energy Renewable Energy Source Areas (YEKA) has won.
The German media announced this development with the words "German Siemens has won the huge protest in Turkey".
DWelle T<0xC3><0xBC>rk<0xC3><0xA7>e said in a statement that the Siemens-T<0xC3><0xBC>rkers-Kalyon consortium won the YEKA grant, "The consortium will invest over $1 billion in wind power plants."
"The tender opened for the creation of the capacity of a megawatt wind energy carries the feature of being Turkey's first YEKA tender" in the news, when the number of companies competing in the tender fell from 8 to 2 today, against the Chinese Mingyang, against the German Siemens consortium
The Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak, who made a statement after the uprising, made striking statements about Turkey-Germany relations.
The campaign was concluded with the victory of the German company Siemens, and we can say that this image is an important message to the region and the world.
As we look at Turkey and Germany in terms of 200 years of historical cooperation, I believe that this outcome will make an important contribution to Turkey-Germany relations.
No matter how much regional crises there are in the world, I am very proud to announce that Turkey is at the forefront of the region and the world’s most dependable investment countries.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, see a possible contest
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who will cut their way to the most satisfying boxing match in the near future for 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
The invincible World Boxing Council lightweight cycling champion Garcia was in separate rooms at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until he walked down the corridor and greeted the World Boxing Organization super feather cycling champion Lomachenko.
With Saturday's vote, four-cycle former world champion Adrien Broner, after Garcia's defeat, both fighters are among the top five on the uncensored list.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on Saturday night at 7 p.m.
While posing for photos, Lomochenko's manager, Egis Klimar, noted that a potential battle between fighters would be "perfect in size".
Garcia reminded me of "I'm an old hairpin."
“I went up for the bronzer (140 pounds) but I’m not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go down a light cycle.
He's got to go through the light cycle (135 pounds), so we can fight.
That's what fans want.
Let's give it to them."
Lomachenko joined.
"Well, he needs this fight."
Klimas asked whether this should be "on the surface and on the horizon; with Garcia (37-0, 30 kavt) setting a date for the next summer and fighting Lomachenko in a 135-pound opening match this year, part of his strategy to fight back against him; with Garcia on the edge of the fort; and on the edge of the fort, on the 23rd of the fort
Garcia said, "The battle can be on the air and on the watch because all the fans want it," and then stated that it was open to him if any channel offered the best financial package.
We are the main names.
No other name is of such interest.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia Lomachenko said he appreciated Lomachenko as a "mighty fighter" and would be able to attend Saturday's meeting.
But Lomachenko hesitated to thank Garcia with a lot of heartache and said that he thought that the three-cycle champion from Riverside looked "very slow", "don't worry, Mikey...you wanted the accident."
Garcia said it was boxing after showing the punching power before the room.
Both said they felt that my moment had been created for their encounters.
“This is a fight that needs to be fought.
Another battle doesn't create so much interest and rumor.
Garcia said, "I'm very happy to deal with this."
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and that's Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight."
Turkish Remnants from Russia to the United States
The White House does not consider imposing sanctions that will affect Moscow’s pipeline constructions, but sanctions against Russia could increase the cost of these lines.
This is due to an increase in the cost of debt.
Worried that Western investment partners were considering withdrawing from the projects because of sanctions, the Kremlin accelerated the construction of pipelines in return.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which is building the Turkish Stream line, which is planned to reach Turkey from under the Black Sea, has given speed to the construction at the request of Gazprom.
Reuters wrote that Gazprom had also begun the construction of a second pipeline parallel to the Turkish Stream "acceleratingly" in order to export more gas to Europe.
New results of Sweden's age assessment test have been revealed
The latest results of the evaluation tests of refugees subject to a new medical age assessment method in Sweden ruled that more than 80 percent of those who took the test were over the age of 18, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these tests.
Sweden’s National Department of Justice and Medicine (R<0xC3><0xA4>ttsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) more accurate in assessing the age of some refugees who claim they are not registered, after criticizing their failures in assessing their correct age.
So far, the Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the test and the Department of Justice and Medicine has now announced the result of a total of 2481 cases from the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (of 2002) were judged to be 18 or above, and in 25 cases, the Department of Justice and the Department of Medicine ruled that it was "probably 18 or above."
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was "probably under 18".
Tests were conducted only in cases where the person’s age is suspect.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson from the Department of Legal Medicine and Medicine, the results are consistent with the past months.
He told The Local, "We don't see a big difference in statistics, the numbers are pretty consistent."
The high rate of cases judged to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that refugees are lying about their age.
In May, the department explained the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases where "the subjects were shown to be 18 years of age or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of 581 reported cases, it was found that 243 cases were clearly 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method, which includes drawing the X-rays of 20-year-old teeth and performing MRI scans of knee joints, then analyzing them to dentists and radiologists, is criticized in some circles.
One suspect is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute who evaluates the biological maturity of people whose studies have been introduced sooner or later than normal to the age of the mole.
“I have reasons to think about it, and I think that’s not the kind of measurement that should be used.
Biological life is very doubtful to decide in this way.
If we can’t say for sure, we shouldn’t do it like that,” he told Metro newspaper.
What’s more, G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson from the Department of Justice and Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, you may say the risk of a child being wrongly judged to be an adult is small.
The greatest risk is that a person is under the age of 18 immediately, and in this case the risk is around 10 percent.”
Star Maternity Shirt Opens in Worship Today
The Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Hamidiye Mosque, built by Abd<0xC3><0xBC>lhamit in 1885 to the architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo, will be opened in worship today with Friday prayers after the restoration work.
Regional Director M<0xC3><0xBC>rsel Jar<0xC4><0xB1> said that restoration work started in June 2013 has been completed and the glass has been made ready for opening.
Yellow gave the following information: "Restoration work was carried out in 2 sections."
The first part was the renovation of the main building.
The second part was environmental regulation.
In the first part, about <0xC2><0xA3>16 million was spent on environmental regulation, and around <0xC2><0xA3>11 million was spent on environmental regulation.
First, the bullets of the wooden dome were opened, after they were renewed, the outer walls, the impurities of external effects, were removed from the pastes.
Drainage has been done in terms of recovery.
There are very rich ornaments as seen when we get into the fireplace.
This is a work with star motifs, very rich in pen work.
There's a way of karma here.
"The traces of the veil are also seen, and if we think that it was done in the Ottomans and 1885s, the baroque style is also beginning to appear in the architecture."
U.S. AMERICA'S EMERGENCY VAR
"The German Emperor 2, located in the middle of my room."
There were some flaws, it was cleaned up and hung in place.
It's a really valuable and important piece.
There are wooden cages, which are symmetrically located on both sides of the window.
We know that this is done by our great judge, Abd<0xC3><0xBC>lhamit Han.
So we have the knowledge that he himself does this with his own hands and is mounted here.
They're still standing here in their original form.
Yellow said President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an was also expected to attend the opening ceremony.
Pantic claim in G<0xC3><0xB6>ztepe
The Ukrainian press wrote that a 25-year-old Serbian footballer who could not enter the squad in Dinoma Kiev could be hired to the yellow-red club.
Starting in Serbia's Red Star team, Pantic wore the forms of Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves in Spain.
Pantic signed Dinamo Kiev between last season's round
West Virginia's governor's party will be changed
West Virginia's Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening that he would change his party with President Trump at a meeting.
Governor Justice said, "Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have left me."
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and thoughts... today I will tell you as West Virginians, and I can no longer help you as a Democratic Governor."
The meeting was filled with cheers.
Justice added, "So tomorrow I'm going to change my record as a Republican."
“If I were a technical director, it was time for you to play a different game.”
Mr. Trump promised to make an important announcement at the West Virginia meeting earlier.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points and the Democratic nominee Justice did not support Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, the only billionaire in the state, Justice was elected in 2016.
Forbes says he owns coal mines in five states with the coal business he inherited from his father.
Its existence is about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Congress on Thursday night issued a statement saying "Vali Justice's change of party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which refuses to work to stop it rather than make our country great again."
RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS, “With only 15 governorships and at least a handful of state legislatures under control in history, Governor Justice’s announcement is only the latest rejection of a party that is unleaderd from the bottom up and doesn’t find a positive, unifying message.”
I will do my best for Turkey.
The third Olympic, the Turkish record holder.
He was born in Cuba, but he named Turkey where he came for F.Bah<0xC3><0xA7>e.
In 2013, he became a Turkish citizen and wore the national form.
He was first European champion and then third Olympic champion.
Now it is one of Turkey’s most important medal hopes at the World Athletics Championships.
Yasmani Capello, who competed in the 400-meter hurdles, spoke to Sabah before the championship starts today.
When they were young, they didn't want you because they didn't like their degrees in Cuba.
You've improved your hold on the coach.
Then they called, but this time you didn't go.
Some people think you chose Turkey for your money.
What do you say?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was my departure from the national team.
From that moment on, I could say that I drew a line on the events I have experienced.
Then, at the invitation of Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e club, I came to Turkey.
It was also thanks to Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e that I joined the National Team.
They offered me an offer for the supplement.
I opened a new page with Turkey.
When I was young, I suffered a lot of injuries, but after the opportunities offered to me in Turkey, I signed on to major successes in Rio and Amsterdam.
I can’t wait to do my best at the World Athletics Championship and win a different title.
You've been holding a press conference the last few days.
Can you tell us why?
Whenever a question is asked about Turkey’s ownership of me, my childhood comes to mind and I’m thrown out of the Cuban National Team at the age of 23.
And, of course, people in Turkey are approaching me.
When I won the gold medal at the European Championships in Amsterdam, I felt the same way when the Stiklal March was being played.
I couldn't hold my tears.
I would also like to thank Turkey for giving me the opportunity to fulfill my dreams.
I'm so glad you belong to the Turkish National Team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You've said before that you could be your Turkish lover.
You're with a Turk right now, you went to Cuba together.
Do you want to share what they live?
The greatest thing about being with a Turk is being calm.
When I compare it to Cuban women, peace is...
Turkish girls are in a relationship with each other.
Your girlfriend is also an assistant coach.
You've been together all day, like, mixing your food?
She's eating sweeter than me.
(both laughing) I don't actually have a very strict diet, but sometimes it interferes with what I eat.
My coach Massimo Matrone is also often on strict warnings with my diet, but I know this is for my own good.
How's your boyfriend cooking you up with Turkish food?
Turkish women make very good food, but my boyfriend makes better.
(Laughter) Dry beans-pilaf is my first preference.
SADECE BELIEVE HIM
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
I was replaced by other young people.
After winning medals on behalf of Turkey, we met in Cuba.
He showed me to the young athletes next to me, and he said, "Look, I raised him."
I just laughed at him.
I'm SO MUCH SILENT
What's interesting about the glasses you wear in the race...
I only use it for concentration.
As soon as I put on my glasses, I cut off my relationship with the world and sewed a wall on both sides.
I'm just focusing on the finish line, and I can't see anything else.
What’s the first thing that comes to mind when we say Tokyo 2020?
Felix Sanchez...
At the 2012 London Olympics, he won the gold medal at the 400 metres hurdles at the age of 35.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo at the age of 33, why not?
TURKCELL DESTEK VERIYOR
Turkcell’s Deputy General Manager Ismail All said that he believed that Yasmani Capello would succeed in London, “We sincerely believe that Yasmani will represent our flag in the best possible way in this championship.”
We wish success to all our athletes who will compete in London.
"We will continue our support for the further development of Turkish athletics and for greater success in our country," he said.
Coe praises Russia's 'honest' self-proclaimed for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the boss of global athletics, praised Russia's frankness in referring to the doping scandal, but stressed that the time was not right for the country to be re-adopted into sports.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, Russia’s athletics boss, told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics that it was right for his country to be ruled out of sport and he was determined to fight doping.
“The gold and silver medals in the competitions are apologizing to all athletes who have been forcibly taken from them,” he said.
Despite its own assessments, the IAAF Congress voted in November 2015 to uphold the ban after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-backed doping in Russia.
IAAF president Coe told reporters, "Today I think it's a very sincere response, a very sincere presentation."
"The whole council and the entire congress were pleased... that the Russian Federation had accepted itself, that it had passed the very busy days and that it had done everything possible to ensure that the federation was rebuilt..."
Coe also said that Russia is "my" when it comes to accepting the re-acceptance criteria.
“I think it’s a very constructive day, and I think it’s taken place, but Congress supports the suggestion that the task force is not the right time for Russia’s rights to be restored,” Coe said.
“In the next few months, we must do everything we can to normalize this situation.
Our guiding principle has always been to separate clean athletes from the flawed system.”
Fifteen Russian athletes, meeting strict IAAF criteria, will compete impartially at the World Athletics Championships, which will begin in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had not yet met many criteria for the return of its rights.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that the drug test was still insufficient and that the banned coaches were still working freely.
Don't lie about 'YPG to YPG' news
The U.S. Embassy in Ankara said no tanks had been given to any of the warring parties in Syria.
The allegations that hundreds of tanks and weapons were sent to the YPG were denied.
The statement from the embassy, entitled "Declaration of false news in the press regarding the rumours going to Syria", was called as follows:
A series of false news reports, which has been in the press in the last few days, falsely claimed that the United States has sent hundreds of tanks and weapons to Syria to support the YPG.
This news ignores some of the basic facts about the current situation in Syria.
The U.S. has not given tanks to any group fighting Deasha in Syria.
Much of the U.S. military assistance, primarily light weapons and ammunition, supports elements of the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG).
The Syrian Arabs, including the SAK, are fighting to clear the area and re-enter their homes.
TYDTA President Ermut: Direct foreign investment will be on top of last year
TYDTA President Arda Ermut said that 55 percent of all investment last year came after July.
Ermut, who reported that there was no decrease in investments due to the FET<0xC3><0x96> coup attempt, just the opposite, "Maybe there would have been more increase, meat shot."
Perhaps if these conditions were not met, if there were no regional developments, we could see a further increase in the impact of the collapse.
That’s why we’re looking forward to more next year.
Hopefully it will be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
By the first five months of the year, we are already seeing an increase of 11 percent compared to the first five months of last year.
But we don't find it enough.
"We hope there will be more," he said.
“Necessarily global, if necessary, regional developments do not cause us any concern,” Ermut said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
Ermut, recalling that 75% of direct investment came from Europe by 2010, continued his words:
That number fell to 66 percent.
Asia’s share again rose from 2 percent to 7-8 percent.
Russia's share has increased.
While we were trying to do this, some problems arose amongst the Gulf countries themselves.
Turkey has good relations with all of them, especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar, two important actors.
But the problem between these two countries saddens us and thus allows investors to delay their decisions a little bit more.
We may be experiencing some delays not only in terms of investments in Turkey, but also in terms of this.
Arda Ermut recalled that some events had taken place over Germany last week, but the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, showed a clear and definite reaction to this situation.
When speaking to investors in the countries where the most severe political crisis has occurred, President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s reaction was, “Look, problems happen between governments, certainly not between peoples.”
Second, these people came and invested in my country.
This is no different for us from Turkish companies.
They'll come to us when they have the slightest problem, we'll solve it.
"We will not allow them to be victims absolutely," Ermut said, adding that they continued to support all investors with the convenience of this.
Ermut said, "We can assure you of this in the next period."
You will see that neither German companies nor investors from some of the countries where we have some political problems will experience any trouble.
On the contrary, I hope that we will do our best to increase investment from these countries as well.
We believe that the investment from here will continue to increase.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect their perceptions of the investment environment.
“But at this point, we will do our best to make it fall on us and not to affect both our investors and the perception of the investment environment,” he said.
TYDTA President Ermut said that after a single-generation road strategy, Turkey began to see great interest from China, but that if problems in the Gulf are solved, they expect the biggest investment from the Gulf.
"There is not even one investor who says in the relations with Germany, 'We had trouble because of these relations, we had investments because of this incident, we are missing out,'" Ermut, who used his statement, noted that there are companies that are coming, coming, and following.
Ermut said: “At present, about 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies.”
So the companies we're talking about from all over the world, almost 10 percent are German companies.
Some of these are companies that are still investing in Turkey.
He's going to increase his investment or something, and that's what we stand for as a project.
“So German companies are actually still a significant part of our daily workflow,” he said.
Ermut, who stressed that all state institutions should be careful during the periods when their reconnaissance operations to Turkey, said that the issue was sensitive and could be affected in the slightest bad communication.
Ermut noted that what happened in the last 2-3 weeks was a good lesson, he said:
The agenda of politicians and investors is always different.
We have always seen this; economic relations always allow for a number of political developments to take place.
Germany will continue to be an important trading partner for us and an important investor for us.
Because there are still a lot of investments in Turkey.
Unfortunately, the election calendar in Germany is increasing these kinds of rumors.
When I get through them, I think they'll get a little better.
Saudi Arabia, in particular, has warned that the two countries will not make a negative statement.
Ultimately, an investor who invests in Turkey is investing by targeting the markets of the entire surrounding country.
So, not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region, there have been slow processes.
But we are still in talks with these investors.
My personal opinion is that investors may be waiting for a decision that they can make more quickly.
“In a negative sense, I see uncertainty because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and I’m leaving here,” he said.
On the contrary, we have Saudi investors who are still living in Turkey, who, on the one hand, have been meeting with us and following all the processes.
Arda Ermut, recalling that the international direct investment (UDY) coming to Turkey last year was $12.3 billion, "I think we will definitely pass it this year.
"But how much we will go through, these regional developments will affect global uncertainties," he said.
While he hoped that the impact of the collision would normally be more, Ermut noted that it might be a little more limited, pointing out that the first 5 months have gone by an increase of 11 percent, and that this could be preserved, "I hope it doesn't get worse", so I'll end up in the end or so.
Ermut, who pointed out that a significant part of the withdrawn investments would continue to be real estate, said new investments could be seen in the fields of logistics, health, fintech, science, petrochemicals, food, energy and manufacturing.
Ermut, who stressed that they will have new investments to make their announcement in the coming months, said: "We may soon have an investment in terms of manufacturing."
Not a billion dollars, but a big investment.
"Interesting countries may also have investments," he said.

How will football's financial rules affect Neymar's going to Paris?
Rules to prevent the unlimited spending of European football clubs will not prevent Neymar from transferring the world record from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
With the ability to manage teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament, the governing body that oversees the European game can draw all kinds of results from UEFA to Paris Saint-Germain.
The Financial Fair Play rules issued by UEFA in 2011 mean that it will have to show that Neymar's transfer to PSG will eventually have to be financed without massive losses.
Barcelona was paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million ($262 million) just to buy Brazil out of the contract, and Neymar will rule out a salary that will earn tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some financial aspects of Neymar's trip to France include:
Given the team’s energy-rich money from the Qatari family, PSG can of course pay for signing Neymar and adding him to the galaxy of other stars.
Clubs are allowed to spend money charged to buy a player, but they also have to balance this with legitimate sources of income by recording that they have reached the top of their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that were in great debt in pursuit of their success were actively defrauding and that if the banks or owners supported them, they were at risk of bankruptcy.
In 2011, the FFP began monitoring the damage rather than focusing on the debts of the clubs.
The change meant that Roman Abramovich's model first used in Chelsea in 2003 (take a potential club, spend a lot of money to improve the team, and create a global brand) would become a more difficult undertaking.
During the three-year FFP evaluation period, which runs until 2018, clubs can suffer damage of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
Although Platini was unrecognizably removed from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Cefer, is still determined to give up without overspending.
Andrea Traverso, managing director of the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: "The FFP is definitely not dead and we will definitely strengthen it by moving the rules forward."
Although PSG Neymar will collectively pay for the purchase of the item, it may extend the amount to the duration of the contract for accounting reasons.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44.4 million in the next five-year accounts.
The first wave of FFP missions in 2014 saw the application of the heaviest missions to Manchester City, owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi.
PSG was later fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>82 million at the time) and ordered to limit the Champions League team to 21 players instead of 25 for the 2014–15 season.
UEFA is in a frenzy against clubs that can try to trick financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to the club’s owners.
While a Qatari company may be a sponsor of PSG, if the value of sponsorship is thought to exceed the standard market values, UEFA will not allow it to be counted as a fair income.
At UEFA 2014, this was the case when the Qatar Tourism Authority ruled that the PSG sponsorship was inflated.
Some of Neymar’s earnings from PSG have been reported to come through the payments of Qatar’s 2022 World Cup organizing committee.
But PSG and Qatar have lied that Neymar will be the ambassador for the 2022 World Cup, and such a move could easily be uncovered by UEFA regulators.
The sanctions imposed on PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be even more careful against attempts to break the rules.
UEFA said on Tuesday that it was not in a preventive conversation with PSG about Neymar’s transfer.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that they were not authorized to talk about PSG's condition, subject to secrecy.
The latest published accounts show that PSG made more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million in profits in 2015-16 with a turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>542.4 million.
The accounts for the previous financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to contribute to sponsorship deals, gift and form sales.
The club expects the circus to increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league, which was clearly disturbed by the departure of one of the football's biggest players, tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG violated the FFP.
Javier Tebas, president of La Liga, told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar as the definitive owner of PSG, "This is an open case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state."
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who owns his own club, shares his concerns about La Liga being funded by a state.
Wenger said on Thursday, “This is a result of having and has completely changed the entire ground of football over the last 15 years.”
“Once a country has a club, everything is possible.
It’s very difficult to respect Financial Fair Play because for a country such a big player can have different ways to represent a country or have different areas of interest.
The 'Tavant Price' Revolt From Insurance Companies
According to TSB data, the insurance industry has been hurting the traffic industry since 2006.
In 2015, the sector was damaged by 2.35 billion TL, while in 2016 it generated only 19 million TL of profits.
The stock exchange operates in Istanbul in Aksigorta, Anatolian Insurance and Sun Insurance.
Speaking at the meeting where TSB’s first six-month results were evaluated in 2017, the Times said that the 11-year damage on traffic insurance reached 7.3 billion TL, with the application of roof premiums, the industry’s damage to 2.3 billion TL this year, up by an estimated factor of 12 per cent.
This year, the Times said that the 2015 figure will be captured, noting that the damage recorded in 2012 and 2015 also took the profits of other industries, "This means that by financing the bad driver, we are also increasing the price of the citizen's housing policy."
“Seventy-five percent of the sector is foreign and our partners abroad have financed a bad driver in a sense,” he said.
In the ages, he went on to say:
We don’t have any expectations of profit from traffic, but looking at the past 11 years, we can’t show that we’ve made any profit in any year.
"We also accept this, but we continue to hope that we can carry that damage with other police in a reasonable environment," he said.
The Times, who said that when the damage to traffic also took away the profitability of other products, there were dramatic price increases, “in 2012 there were about 30 percent price increases in traffic insurance, in 2015 it almost doubled, we wrote the biggest damage in our history.”
“Even in an environment where prices are so rising, our wife in traffic at the end of 2016 was only 19 million TL,” he said.
The Times, who said they expect the free fare to be passed next year, "We will lower the price of a good driver in the free fare and apply a high price to the bad driver."
“But the Treasury is looking at the general trend, the last word on when it will be in the Treasury,” he said.
The Treasury said that the rise in compulsory traffic insurance premiums since 2015 has affected a wide segment of society, and that from April 12, the maximum premium (the ceiling price) has been applied.
According to this, the maximum premiums for each group of vehicles with regard to compulsory traffic insurance policies have been established on the basis of mandatory traffic insurance on the basis of the annual groups determined, taking into account the scale and traffic intensity of the accident statistics.
On the other hand, as of July, the application of the “Risk Insurance Pool” for vehicle groups has been implemented to increase the frequency of damage to compulsory traffic insurance.
The premium and damage to the pool-based traffic insurance policies will be shared among insurance companies.
These insurers will be identified by the primary Treasury.
In the first 6 months of 2017, premium production in traffic decreased by 11.5 per cent compared to the same period the previous year, while the number of police increased by 4.9 per cent to 8.6 million, and inflation increased by 30 per cent, taking into account the decrease in traffic polices.
This year, <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar said that traffic will again take the snow in other branches, "These ceiling prices cannot sustain this damage.
How much more damage can the industry carry?”
All companies in the sector have capital of 9 billion TL, when only 2.3 billion TL of traffic is damaged, the Times says that the capital of the sector will be finished in three years, "Why are foreigners financing the bad driver, why are thousands of shareholders financing Turkey?"
"At this point, we're trying to tell the Treasury about our problem," he said.
After these developments, on a question about whether foreigners have come to the point of reducing weight in the Turkish insurance sector, the Times said, "They haven't come to that point yet."
They expect to make more investments in Turkey because in the Netherlands, an average of 6 policies per person fell, while in Turkey, this is 1.3.
"So Turkey is a place that needs to grow in the real sense," he said, and went on to say:
So they didn't give up here.
However, although the company earns a reasonable profit each year, it uses all the profits to grow the company.
According to TSB data, premium production in the sector in 2016 amounted to 40.5 billion TL, with a 12 percent increase of 23.1 billion TL in the first half of this year, compared to the same period last year.
Times said the sector could not complete with 15 percent annual growth in total prime production, he said.
News of social assistance to thousands of chronic patients
The details and implementation of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Coping with Chronic Diseases", which began work some time ago under the direction of Minister of Family and Social Policy Fatma Bet<0xC3><0xBC>l Sayan Kaya, became clear.
In the first phase, 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients will benefit from the social assistance program to be launched for poor citizens and their families.
Patients will also be provided with regular psychosocial support, as well as monthly support over two-thirds of the minimum wage.
The ministry will also make additional payments to tuberculosis patients who are found to be unable to take care of themselves, to continue their lives depending on the bed, or to the need to improve their living conditions in the health unit.
Payments will be made via Social Assistance Cards, which will be provided through PTT.
Payment will be made at the door to those who are unable to withdraw money for reasons such as geographical conditions, disease, disability.
The program has the feature of being the first in the world in many ways.
One of the 10 companies to invest is still German.
Prime Minister Arda Ermut, President of the Turkish Investment Support and Promotion Agency, said that the political tension between the two countries is not reflected in the business world where German firms in Turkey are seen as a Turkish firm.
“There is no single investor in relations with Germany who says, ‘We’re running out of trouble because of this situation,’” Ermut said.
Ermut, “About 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are from German companies.”
Some of them have investments in Turkey.
"The Germans make up an important part of our daily business flow," he said.
Ermut also suggested that Abraaj Group’s partnership with Netlog was a good example of this.
Abraaj Group Partner Omar Syed, pointing to economic growth in Turkey, said, "We have invested a total of $1 billion in Turkey."
On the way to being the last Ottoman
It was reported that the experienced footballer who gave two weeks to find the club, Osmanl<0xC4><0xB1>spor, will sign an official contract in the coming days.
At the beginning of last season, <0xC3><0x96>zer Hurmac<0xC4><0xB1>, who signed a contract with the green-white club for 4 hours until 2019, had made a significant contribution to the team with 5 goals in 2 cup matches, with 4 assists.
The administration that cut the way back to <0xC3><0x96>zer, agreed yesterday with Brazilian Sergio Antonio instead of this player.
The transfer of the century has taken place!
Barcelona has announced that Neymar will transfer to Paris Saint-Germain for a fee of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million.
Recently, the transfer development, which the football public has been excitedly following, has been officially launched.
PSG paid the Catalan team <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million, the player’s release fee for the Brazilian player, to join the star name squad.
Neymar became the most expensive transfer in football history along with this bonservis fee.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has signed a five-year contract with Brazilian star Neymar from the French 1st Football League (Ligue 1).
A statement from the club's website said that Neymar, 25, who has been named the world's most expensive footballer, was awarded <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million in bonus-servicing fees and signed a contract with PSG until June 30, 2022.
Speaking after the signing ceremony, Neymar said he was very happy to be in shape as a representative of France, "Since I started my football life in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most challenging and ambitious teams."
The reason I came to this club is to join my teammates, to get as many cups as our fans want.”
PSG will pay Neymar <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 million for each season.
Thus, the cost of the star player will cost the representative of France a fee of over 400 million euros.
The strike of the sea workers is over.
The company of <0xC4><0xB0>zmir B<0xC3><0xBC>y<0xC3><0xBC>k<0xC5><0x9F>ehir Municipality did not enter into an agreement in the collective agreement between <0xC4><0xB0>ZDENIZ A.<0xC5><0x9E>. and T<0xC3><0xBC>rk-<0xC4><0xB0><0xC5><0x9F>.
After that, the union member <0xC4><0xB0>ZDEN<0xC4><0xB0>Z workers went on strike on July 12.
The strike, which lasted nearly a month, ended at about 3 p.m. today after the workers were sacked.
According to the signed collective bargaining agreement, 12 percent of the salary of the black personnel of the IZDENIZ complex will be paid.
The rate of turnover of the IZDEN<0xC4><0xB0>Z, which renews its fleet, is 5 per cent, along with the income tax exemption obtained after the registration of the International Ship Sicilian, which increases the salary by 25 per cent and is accepted for personnel in the status of the shipman.
The <0xC4><0xB0>ZDEN<0xC4><0xB0>Z General Directorate announced that the trips to the inner bay will continue with the normal tariff, from Tuesday the trips to Yass<0xC4><0xB1>caada, and the trips to Fo<0xC3><0xA7>a and Urla will start from the end of next week.
TDS President Hasan Pekdemir said that they had blocked access with their strikes lasting 23 days, saying: "The Izmir people will relax."
As a result of the strike, improvements were made to the rights of our workers working on land and sea.
We're happily leaving the table.
An average of 28 per cent will be in the sea and 20 per cent will be in the land.
We also had friends who worked at the minimum wage level.

Nostalgia Becomes a Niche with "Wet Hot American Writing" and "Comrade Detective"
So for the bright days of the characters in the '80s, for the grunge period in the '90s (it was when brains like David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV) and for himself, that is, for 2001, the stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went on to defend themselves with bigger things.
As a cultural product, this is both the epitome of our time with a constant memory of Facebook.
But as a series, it's like time's running out.
The "First Day of Camp" was unexpectedly successful, and this was not only due to absurd humor (in it, there was a story about the origins of a box of plants spoken by H. Jon Benjamin.)
Focusing on the basic comics (playing the children of the underprivileged of the middle-aged actors) he realized the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.
Now that adults are playing "Ten Years After" is less emotional and includes a monologue about a rogue-follower movie like "Hand That Blows the Bell" of the 90s, the parody is more common.
At one point, the character mixes an Apple Powerbook, some one-wheeled patents, and “a lot more than 1991.”
Many of the main stories are the same.
The soft-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter) is now a writer, yet he has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
There is also another insanely fake plan that Ronald Reagan (again, Mr. Showalter) is now intrigued by George H. W. Bush (a very well-settled imitation by Michael Ian Black).
The best part of the series, as usual, is the interlocutor.
Especially Matt Dillon's ever-young Mr. Rudd, who has six beards on his lips in "The Bachelors", is so nice to see that his, Andy, the most popular kid in the old school, now looks like a morgue.
This series can be moments of random madness that give power (e.g., a sort of repeating "Seven Up!" series) until I reach what I think is a logical result: "Wet Hot American Writing: Twenty Years After" that the film's final scene with the band of friends going to "Wet America"
Meanwhile, Amazon’s “Comrade Detective” appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revival of “The Americans,” the film “The War Bomb,” and even the iconography of “GLOW” against the Eastern, Western struggle.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy directed by Rhys Thomas looks like a TV set: a 1980s Romanian police drama in which the Two Towers police officer fights for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The lead roles are played by the wolf Gregor and the idealist Joseph, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, the English duplicate of their dialogues by Channing Tatum (who is also the main producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But that's not much of an idea.
There are some nice visual comics (Americans watch football, cops spend time watching chess on TV)
The well-known voice-over artist's staff, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny, is a good material for the "who knows who the song" game.
But the "Comrade Detective" is so self-inflicted that a blatant propaganda drama is likened to a reality that (including a killer wearing a Reagan mask), he often plays just like him.
Six long episodes don’t know how to go through, and comedy isn’t fast enough or frequent enough.
While Gregor and Joseph constantly visit the American embassy, where two fat hamburgers, like a bunch of hungry wolves, are in the lobby, the "Comrade Detective" could have better served the propaganda streak if it was shortened to a narrower length.
His message to the communist watchdog could turn Western culture into a food that will defeat anything in series.
The founding Romanian creators are not wrong: we do this to our own and even to their own past.
FET<0xC3><0x96>'s father is a woman
As a result of 50 years of experience, the British Government has found our family to be prosperous and sacrificial.
The government's superior authorities have since admitted that this family has been strictly dependent on the British Government and is in great service.
The British Government must be wise and careful about this fidget, which it raises with its own hands, and must carefully investigate and examine everything and make a decision.
While trying to understand the FET<0xC3><0x96>, the organization of the Hashites is considered to be the starting point, but a forgotten difference is that the FET<0xC3><0x96> is an organization that emerged in the imperialist period and operates with colonial sages.
In this example, the 'internal movement' that should be addressed is Women.
The person who describes himself as 'the son-in-law of the British Government', in English praise in the East, is Mirza Gul<0xC3><0xA2>m Ahmet Kadiy<0xC3><0xA2>n<0xC3><0xAE>, the founder of Kad<0xC4><0xB1>y<0xC4><0xB1>lik.
G<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xA2>m Ahmed, a small town in the Indian state of Pencap, said: "On December 1, 1888, Allah ordered his supporters to take the oath and form a separate congregation."
Gul<0xC3><0xA2>m Ahmed went a little further in 1891, saying that according to the revelation and inspiration he received, Jesus b. Mary died with a natural death like other prophets, and that God sent him as the Messiah and martyr that Christians and Muslims expected.
In this regard, he is the same person as the Messiah that Muslims expect, and this is Mirza Gul<0xC3><0xA2>m Ahmed K<0xC3><0xA2>diy<0xC3><0xA2>n<0xC3><0xAE>.
(Islamic Encyclopedia, TDV)
In India, completely under British rule after the Sipahi Uprising of 1857, Gul<0xC3><0xA2>m Ahmed, who wrote books defending Muslims from persecution against Hindus and Christians, is believed to have been founded with completely sacrosanct sects, but with the CIA's support he later emerged in the Erzurum Commune in exile.
Like G<0xC3><0xBC>len, G<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xA2>m Ahmed’s favorite idea among imperialists is that “jihad” is a struggle that Muslims only struggle with their own souls and if they can live their religion freely, there is no scope for imperialism to be fought.
Even if you remember G<0xC3><0xBC>len, one step further and further, the wound in our history was still clear, even in a 'vaz' last year that we praised: "It's not too dangerous for the Crusader to invade your country.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
They do not belong to your wife or your daughter.
They don't belong to the mabedinze, the unaffiliated Crusaders!
Considering that the Mahdi and Christianity are united in themselves, the idea that their own community will be the savior of Islam, the similarity of the concept of jihad to the FET<0xC3><0x96>, in addition to the similarity of the thesis to the FET<0xC3><0x96>, the spread of femininity in general to the education and civil society.
The total number of women in the world, said to be over 2 million, was 23 in 1869, and the number of countries officially registered by the emergency aid organization called "Humanity First".
In addition, 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensaries in 55 countries, 8 women's magazines in Africa alone, 505 educational institutions in 11 countries, and around 16,000 mosques worldwide.
The Nobel Prize-winning "first Muslim scientist" Prof. Abd<0xC3><0xBC>sselam, United Nations President of the Court of Justice Sir Zaferullah Han, the "first Oscar-winning Muslim actor" Mahershala Ali is also considered to be Kad<0xC4><0xB1>y<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>, who is considered to be the most global actor.
Let’s note that the women’s meeting with 30,000 people in the UK last week was also highlighted as a body show.
One of their slogans is enough to take a brief look at their history to understand that women, who are “love everyone, don’t hate anyone,” actually mean “love your employers/colleagues.”
It is possible to extend the starting point and motivations of developments such as H<0xC3><0xBC>lasa, FET<0xC3><0x96> or Tahir-ul Kadri to the Women, and all of these organizations are in fact encouraged to embrace imperialism and serve colonialism in order to rejuvenate societies.
The “last wish” came out of the box.
Emily Pomeranz, 50, who spent her final days in a hospital in Washington due to pancreatic cancer, has voiced her desire for a coffee and chocolate-mixed milkshake (a sweet drink) from a restaurant in her hometown.
A friend of hers contacted the owner of a restaurant called Tommy's.
Tommy Fello, who has run the same restaurant for 47 years, put his drink on dry ice and sent his $123 (435 TL) fee with a “quick delivery” freight to the hospital 600 kilometers away.
Two new projects from Ahmet Kul
To date, Ahmet Kul <0xC4><0xB0>nshaat, which has carried out important projects such as Lavinya Park, Otoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, Dia Mare in Istanbul and Solse 7 projects in Bodrum Yalikavak have been sold.
The geometry of the Dia Mare project, developed by the architect <0xC3><0x87>amo<0xC4><0x9F>lu Architecture, was developed to take maximum advantage of the sea.
Located on an area of 11,000 square meters, Dia Mare has a total of 188 dwellings and 17 commercial units.
The project, which is completely completed, will begin to be delivered to new owners in March 2018.
There are many types of apartments in Dia Mare, ranging from 2+1 to 5+1.
This year, the company is preparing to sign two major projects in Topkap<0xC4><0xB1> and Mimaroba and Bitez.
753 million transferred to joint ventures
At the TRT where 6,760 personnel work, the Peace Partner said many programs were carried out and paid for at low prices.
The CHP representative again regretted the nation's taxes on AKP companies in "TRT 2016."
“That name is stolen,” he said.
The source, which TRT transmitted to the joint-stock companies, was revealed with the data obtained from official documents.
The official response to the application made by the <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul National Counsel for Peace Partner within the framework of the Information Acquisition Act highlighted how TRT’s resources were spent.
In the TRT, where 6,760 people work as staff, the partner said that, despite all sorts of technical possibilities, through the programs carried out under the name of outsourcing, it was transferred to the joint companies in 2016 total 753 million 500 thousand TL.
The CHP representative used the phrase, "This means emphasis."
“The production companies of AKP’s journalists and businessmen are putting TRT in jeopardy.”
“Millions are being paid for undetected or undetected works,” he said.
Recalling that the money transferred to the companies was collected from the taxes of the people, "the institution, which has 7,000 staff, has returned to the AKP's treasury."
"These companies have signed on to what programs that 7,000 people can't do, and they got that money?" he said.
TRT’s advertising revenue in 2016 was 224.456.182 TL, which stated that the advertising revenue remained in the balance when the Company took into account staff salaries and other expenses.
“The TRT, which has become the voice of the AKP, can’t advertise because it isn’t being watched.”
Feeding journalists are taking money from the TRT, screaming on behalf of the AKP.
He said, "The people are pulling their burdens."
CHP’s Partner said: “TRT pays 660 million TL per year to personnel, but gives all the work to external constructions.”
753.5 trillion people have been displaced from the TRT, i.e., from the pockets of the people.
That's a double-edged sword.
He gave up his life in front of his wife and apologized.
The incident took place this afternoon in a parking lot in Dy<0xC4><0xB1>rmen Street in Ey<0xC3><0xBC>po<0xC4><0x9F>lu District.
According to the information obtained, environmental residents who saw a citizen crawling down from the 4th floor of the parking lot reported the situation to the fire and health teams.
While the fire crews were opening fire in the area where the person was staying, the health teams were also waiting.
The 34-year-old father of three children, Yunus G., who gave up on suicide after nearly an hour of convincing efforts by psychologists and police teams called for the incident, apologized in front of his wife, N.G., who watched him in tears.
On the other hand, about 100 people on the street where Yunus G', a suicide bomber, were watching the situation sitting on the ramps, while some citizens recorded it with their mobile phones.

Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected that soon after the Bank of England has reduced speculation that slow economic growth and moving inflation will be an increase, interest rates will not change.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue "slowly" due to the fact that they kept their interest rates steady along with the shrinking of family incomes.
The decision-makers in the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) took 6 to 2 votes to keep the interest rate at 0.25 percent, so this month, after the slow-growing support of economic growth weakened, they asked for fewer members to increase.
In its three-month inflation report, the bank pulled growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that household incomes would continue to shrink in the spring, with inflation still expected to rise close to 3%.
However, he said interest increases would be necessary in the next few years to curb Brexit’s shadowed inflation, and that borrowing costs could remain in the event of a higher than expected increase in financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of withdrawing part of the massive economic recovery package launched a year ago after Brexit.
The bank said it would end the Regular Funding Plan, which offers cheap financing to banks starting next February, but expects to offer more than <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>115 billion in total) under the plan.
Minutes after the interest decision was taken, the bank said: “The central estimate of the MPC is that the contraction of domestic real incomes (GSYH) is continuing slowly in the short term, with the central estimate of the MPC continuing to be a burden on consumption.”
On the issue of interest rates, he stressed that "a number of cuts in monetary policy" might be necessary to ease inflation and that the market would be "a part higher" than expected.
Markets are still predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and that someone else will be in 2020.
But the bank stresses that any increase will be "step by step" and "limited".
According to forecasts in May, the bank’s annual and next-year reduced growth forecasts are compared to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank maintains its forecast of 1.8 percent in 2018.
Sterling, after the news, lost value against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to US$1.31 and by 0.4% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.11.
The decision not to change came after GSYH’s last growth figures, which created disappointment in the previous three months, were reduced by 0.3% compared to the second quarter, after a slump in expectations of growth.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but will start to show a slight increase towards the end of the year, according to the bank.
While the bank says the cut will get even worse before it rectifies, the latest inflation report leaves very little to delight the household people hit by rising inflation and wage increases.
The bank said the monetary policy could not "improve" the impact of the strike on income in the next few years but expected the salaries to be "significantly" adjusted towards the end of the three-year forecast.
As a result of the weak pound, the rise in demand for British goods will support the economy by balancing some of its declining consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the shock EU referendum, which led to the pound being voted down, fell interest rates to 0.25 percent last August.
The bank predicts that it will likely take four years to fully impact prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank’s latest interest rate decision, there was a demand for an increase in inflation pressure on the Georgian household population and an increase in interest rates by three policymakers to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in July to 2.6% last month, but the bank said it expected it to increase again in the coming months.
According to their 2% target, the bank said the overtaking was “completely” related to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent declines in Takas ratios, while lenders have a business and a positive demand to close the year, the mortgage market will once again become even more competitive.
The market looks so good for those who are nearing the end of their existing contracts, with many free options and low interest rates becoming even more popular than ever.”
NHS to Write HIV Drug for 10,000 People to Discuss
In the Supreme Court, after a fight over the funding of the drug in the NHS, patients will be able to reach the ‘converter’ HIV prevention treatment starting in September.
The NHS has announced that it will provide pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to up to 10,000 people via a 3-year pre-trial trial, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 percent.
The Supreme Court’s decision last year, after the approval of the Court of Appeals, agreed to fund the experiment. In the decision, it was said that it had the power to pay for PrEP, despite claims by the NHS to finance local authorities.
The move, which was announced on Thursday, was met with a "new and serious intervention" by NHS UK President Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "point of reference".
The population of sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first recorded clinics, with the participation of more clinics in October being fully implemented throughout the UK until April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a series of HIV drugs that reduce the risk of getting HIV before sex.
Trials have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that a person has enough drugs in their body to prevent HIV infection from settling.
These medications can be taken every day or up to two hours before sex.
Those who are eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexual people, and HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics will identify suitable participants who will be willing to experiment with men, women, transsexual individuals, and their partners’ HIV status with an anti-retroviral treatment.
Individuals who live in the UK and are registered to a practicing doctor will also be able to register for potential participation in participating local sexual health clinics.
The program will hold <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and the NHS has signed a deal to provide medicines this week with a bid to the UK international.
The trial was designed to assess PrEP's full potential by gathering clinical evidence on how PrEP is targeted, executed, and applied on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: "This new and serious intervention will contribute to a broad and increasingly successful effort in the prevention of HIV.
This is another milestone in thirty years of development in subduing one of humanity’s important health problems.”
Deborah Gold, president of the National Aids Trust (NAT), said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If the target is right for those in need and those at risk, PrEP offers a chance to convert the HIV outbreak in the UK.
As of September, people at high HIV risk, through this experiment funded by the NHS in the UK, will arrive at a new and powerful vehicle that is truly person-specific and not open to peer-to-peer negotiations; this will lead to many lives recovering.
We welcome this announcement in a warm way.”
Ian Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The first thing we need to do is to quickly present the experiment across the country and ensure that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
As the PrEP trial drug is now provided, we are on the right track for the protection of more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV.”
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “We welcome the start of the PrEP experiment and the months of delays and then the government’s resignation are late.
Evidence shows that this drug is part of our vision to prevent HIV and how transformable it can be in ending the infection of this life-changing infection.
The experiment will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this experiment is presented as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to end the spread of HIV in society.

Two Secrets of Death
Former Minister of Industry and Trade Ayhan <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu’s daughter <0xC3><0x9C>mit Makbule <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who was born in Washington, lost her life by falling below the 19th floor of a business center also used as a hotel in Istanbul Levent.
The student of Ko<0xC3><0xA7> University was also found dead at Melis Saliho<0xC4><0x9F>lu, 24, at his home.
Saliho<0xC4><0x9F>lu's self-suspension was pushed forward.
An investigation into two suicide-related deaths, which were later reported by police and considered suicide, has been launched.
'DEPRESSION WAS VALID'
The first Turkish Minister of Industry and Trade Ayhan <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who served in the government of Nihat Erim in 1971, entered the Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler on August 1, 1966, the daughter of Umit Makbule <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who was born in Washington.
An ambulance and police team were called to the scene instead of a Kuwaiti tourist who had seen the lifeless body of <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who settled in the 19th floor of the room and was unable to hear from him for a while.
The health team determined that <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who fell to the 19th floor of the hard floor, had lost his life.
Mediha <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, the mother of the police, said: “There has been a depressive state in recent times.”
On July 31, he arrived in Istanbul from Ankara.
I've got a grandson who's sick of my other daughter's solace.
"He was interested in my grandson and was negatively affected by my grandson's illness," he said.
<0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu is expected to be buried in Ankara, where his funeral is being held.
It's being investigated whether <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu was fired by someone or committed suicide.
'CANINA KIYDI' DEPARTMENT
Another suspicious death in Istanbul occurred in Sar<0xC4><0xB1>yer Zekeriyak<0xC3><0xB6>y.
Melis Saliho<0xC4><0x9F>lu (24), who studied at Ko<0xC3><0xA7> University, was found dead in his home.
Allegedly, the girl's father went to her home near the school where she couldn't get the news and couldn't reach her from her cell phone.
Dad met his daughter's lifeless body at home.
He was pushed forward by his family, close friends, and Melis, who was very much loved by his family and friends, to end his life by hanging himself in the house.
Melis Saliho<0xC4><0x9F>lu's death has broken the law on his family and loved ones.
After Melis, a friend of mine said on social media, “A purple purple sun was hitting our faces.”
The green grass beneath our feet was our delight when Jack and his best friend and sister Ey<0xC5><0x9F>an were running after that little plastic ball.
“What was needed now is death,” he shared.
Living a luxurious life: Hanging floors and smart design numbers have turned this little Earls Courts apartment into a holiday home.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate refurbishment, went into retirement in 2014 by moving from a spacious home in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court.
The spectacular Queen Anne style is evidence of a new design in the first floor of a terrace and convinced Joanne to collect her bags.
“I used to live in a much bigger area with my ex-boyfriend at Knightsbridge,” says Joanne.
“I was looking for something similar to my price.
The apartment at Earl Court was shown to me and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with him and offered him an offer that day.”
After the first sighting, the 1,000-square-foot apartment was renovated from the ground up.
Initially it was a one-room and complex plan property; you had to go through the kitchen to reach the bedroom. Joanne wanted to add a storage space and a hanging floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
“I wanted high ceilings, large windows and a lot of light.
That was my condition,” he said.
To this end, Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed took advantage of Erfan Azadi's 12.5 ft ceiling and not only a structure but also a place Joanne would live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two areas to the top, so the architectural challenge was to create a hanging floor that could stand inside.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.
"The steel skeleton is quite complex," he explains.
“We had to adjust the gaps so that they could be assembled without the need to bend over each other.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but at the same time the steels would bend so that they would be at the right height according to the top or bottom function."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-sized rooms on top of each other, bringing many additional dramas as well.
The old type of copper light window, taken from Retrouvius for the hanging floor, looks at the magnificent living space below.
Mirrored gold color determines the style of furniture, silver accents and all the design of the old type of Serge Mouille lighting.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of space, space and light.
Mirrors placed on both ends of the short corridor allow it to look longer.
The mirrored protective panel in the kitchen gives the feeling of a window opening into another room.
The mirrored units in the hallway give Joanne the space to hide all the ratchet knife kits and razors.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a more magnificent sense of space, can cover the kitchen when not in use.
The kitchens are not new.
What is unique about this is that there is a door that can be lifted up in the garage style.
Erfan explains the steel-reinforced MDF door, "We used some engineering in this."
“It has a balance weight, so it slides really easily when you push the door up.”
With the intelligent use of the space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 16 square meters, an extra bedroom and an improved seating plan.
“At the end of the day, what you’re selling is what you’re selling, or the value of your property is determined,” Erfan says.
"As a trustee, an estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the seating area."
They were able to use high-quality materials that give the area a luxurious appearance while increasing the floor area.
Erfan says, “Materials are objects that you touch and thus help you establish an emotional bond at home.”
"At home, you won't fall in love with the power lines on the wall.
These are important, but they don’t shake the strings of your heart.”
This is proof that through good design and increased square footage, an apartment can turn from a standard thing to something quite magnificent.
In fact, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.
Jeremain Lens Bonservice in Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>
At the end of the 1.5-month talks, he transferred to Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> with Lens Bonservice, which was initially considered a rental.
After a week of intensive talks, Lens agreed with the Black-and-White team in exchange for a fee of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 million in bonuses.
The Dutch player, who has signed a five-year deal, is expected to receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 million a year.

Actor and singer Emre Altu<0xC4><0x9F> entered the world house in Sortie with the manikin <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>la <0xC5><0x9E>ikel, who has been in a relationship with her for about 4 years.
The couple immortalized the photograph taken at their wedding ceremony, which they called "the most special memory of our lives."
The couple decided to divorce after seven years.
The brothers are fighting for a $500 million estate empire.
The two brothers are at war for one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, forty years after the house their Italian families founded.
Former Carlton Football Club director and contractor Colin De Lutis lives three doors away from his little brother Paul, Paul, in an estate in Toorak, who gives himself to the Supreme Court about how to share his assets and assets.
Paul had been wanting to leave the family business since 2014, but the High Court continued to have heated arguments about the break-up.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers Smith Street own 38 properties, worth more than half a billion dollars, which have been accumulated since a store they bought in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain with 160 retail outlets.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in the property, and De Lutis’ portfolio currently includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento contracting areas, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and shopping malls in the neighborhood.
As part of a deal with his deceased father, Colin (described by Paul as a "significant driving force and dominant figure" in the De Lutis family) owns two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul owns one-third.
A court file says it means Colin has $316 million and Paul has a property worth $176 million.
For Paul, sharing property and cash is a contentious issue.
In his first sworn statement to the court in 2015, he wrote: “The divisions proposed by Colin were leaving him with the properties I have always called the best.”
The first High Court hearing was held on Friday after a series of failed mediations.
The brothers are also in a fight over who will control the current job; Paul claims that Colin has left himself out of the job.
Colin claims this isn't true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some of his assets.
Colin says in a sworn statement he initially made that he hoped to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots dictate to me that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of affidavits filed by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, e-mails and top lawyers like Allan Myers, QC, and senior law firms held by both sides are increasing.
Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband, Luigi, were an Italian immigrant family who operated bakeries and canteens from the late 1950s, and in the early 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
Colin's property was confiscated to buy Collingwood's property, where the family's first shoe store was opened.
Colin says he founded Westco there "in my last years, when Paul was a little boy (10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hope to leave their property to their sons in a friendly manner.
“Luigi often told me that he never wanted his brothers to go to court,” he wrote.
The other two brothers Mark and Luke are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; according to Colin, when he quit his job, he paid Mark $10 million, and Luke $26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark "were dissatisfied with the terms of their financial separation."
According to his 2015 biography of television star Eddi McGuire, Colin tried not to draw attention despite being a member of the board of directors of an old AFL club.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and his lawyers on Friday.
Just because Colin was in court with a short message, he replied, "I can't say much."
"It was very sad that my brother Paul would prefer to sue me and drag our family's name to the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote that he was trying to meet his brother’s demands in a court of law.
"Our father didn't want Paul and I to get into the current disagreement," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful about the solution."
Friday seems to have lost hope.
Colin wrote, "Our problem will be resolved by the courts in the near future."
Trump’s new special pen plans to limit the president’s media diet.
Others tried and failed, too.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do that.
If so, it'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House special charter will restrict President Trump's flow of information (including news media reports), in the hope of keeping his boss more stable.
Here's a little bit of information from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the White House's new special pen met senior staff on the first day of John F. Kelly's job, President Donald Trump outlined a key problem that he planned to solve about the White House: bad information being passed on to the president.
Kelly told the staff, whether it was on paper or with briefings, that information had to flow over itself, because the president could have made better decisions when given good information.
Kelly’s recognition seems very meaningful, but others have tried to emulate Trump by overseeing the media diet and have failed.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades, and he’s now in the White House, the TV-watching scene is still in good shape.
Sam Nunberg, a former campaign consultant, told Politico in February, “If Aday Trump was upset that he didn’t have a fair place in the media, it was more productive to show him that he had found a fair place in convincing media organizations.”
Tara Palmeri of Politico at the time wrote, “According to six campaign officials, the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control was to ensure that personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise.”
I'm fine.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit is “under control” at any time is ridiculous.
Perhaps this campaign officials know something that the rest of us don’t know, for example, Trump’s tweets will be much more provocative if they don’t intervene.
We’ll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump hasn’t sent.
If he could have gotten her out of danger a few times, then his efforts were worth it.
But no one has stopped Trump from constantly creating a debate.
Part of the problem was that the White House was made up of people who were competing against each other, who were trying to advance their own agendas with the materials they were offering to Trump (they could have been reliable or unreliable), and who were leading their own worldviews.
In May, during the entire story, Politico reported a tendency for consultants to strategically convey questionable information to the president.
Here is an example of what the reporter Shane Goldmacher described in detail:
Existing and former Trump officials say Trump has been aggressively reacting to negative headlines from the press, especially to leaks that have a bad effect, and has taken over to find out where they came from.
At the end of February, the head of one of the internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson from GotNews.com gave Katie Walsh a printed copy of an article accusing her of being a "source behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
It didn’t matter if Johnson was basically banned from Twitter because of harassment, or if he didn’t provide any tangible evidence, or if he had made plain accusations in the past and turned away from them.
Trump read the article and started asking staff questions about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that the then special columnist Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter was trying to put in place a system that “managed and documented the documents Trump received.”
How did this result?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will emerge as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still on his own and his aides are still racing for influence.
These immutable factors will make Kelly's job very difficult.
Crypto FET<0xC3><0x96>’s “revealed” with a special template
Prosecutor Berkant Karakaya of the Republic of <0xC4><0xB0>zmir, under the investigation carried out with regard to the leaking of certain information with the "military spy investigation", is the Chief of Staff of the Chief of Staff of the "Complicated" witness code.
In the review, it was stressed that unlike the fact that the Admiralty did not have an organizational menu, it helped the investigating authority to decipher the crypto-organizational menus in the Command of the Navy and played an active role in the fight against FET<0xC3><0x96>.
The decision, which indicated that Yayc<0xC4><0xB1> was tried to be pacified by order of the Navy Command on July 15 in an attempted coup attempt, resulted in an effective fight against FET<0xC3><0x96> from the first day of Yayc<0xC4><0xB1>'s coup attempt.
The following statements were used in the decision of non-compliance given by Karakaya: "Thanks to the special template for the identification of members of the FET<0xC3><0x96> and 64 basic criteria, created on 209 sub-criteria, the work of the Crypto Sea Forces Command was carried out by the operator.
It is known that there is an active anti-terrorist organization in the fight against terrorism as a result of a prior, special and persistent effort in judicial investigations, a conspiracy of the secret witness, and no evidence of the existence of a counter-terrorist organization in this direction.
The Admiralty had previously been tried on charges of insulting him.
It turned out that there were FET<0xC3><0x96>s again and that the alleged crime was culpable.
Former Air Pilot Governor Hakan Din<0xC3><0xA7>, who was found in the complaint that the plaintiff had insulted him, turned the complaint into a mere information note, Adana <0xC4><0xB0>ncirlik 10.
Commander of the Tanker Base Air Force General Bekir Ercan Van, former General Staff Chairman of the General Staff with permission to investigate, Colonel Muharrem K<0xC3><0xB6>se, former Chief of the General Staff of the General Staff of the Investigation Team, Colonel Mustafa <0xC3><0x87>ezsoy, former Chief of Staff of the General Staff of the General Staff of the General Staff of the Army
Some of the members of the organization, which also includes Tuncay Op<0xC3><0xA7>in, the FET<0xC3><0x96> fair, appeared to target Yayc<0xC4><0xB1> with their social media posts before and after the July 15 coup attempt.
Travelers crossed the gap, returned to the 'rich neighborhood'
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are back in battle with the ruthless travelers who cross the gap dug by the council to reclaim the area outside their own mansions.
Travelers parked their 20-seater caravans outside an area known as Solihull's "rich neighborhood", which is the street in Solihull's current location.
The council, without swerving from the trench it dug to cut off, took the babies and a full truck and returned just after being fired in May.
The cleverly-moving group found a gap in defense, slid their vehicles into it in the guise of setting up a path from a section that left their vehicles barricaded.
Angry residents criticized the Solihull Council for saying it was "useless to solve the problem."
An unnamed resident said: “After they were sent from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passersby, they came there on Monday evening.
He should be ashamed of the council's actions because they are useless in solving the problem.
The passengers were there in May, they were sent, and now they're back again.
There was more coming last night, and there will probably be more coming today.”
He added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with the long-distance decisions taken to protect the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Street and I’m not happy to continue paying my tax while the council can’t even stop it.”
A local resident who did not want to give his name said: “Like a joke, we saw that the last group of travelers had just left, that we were immediately devastated by a new group.
The numbers had increased this time, and it was even seen that a horse was riding in the parking lot."
A spokeswoman for the Solihull Council said: “We are aware that there is an unauthorized camp on Streetsbrook Street grounds, we are launching the necessary legal procedures to send them from there as soon as possible.
In order to support our gathering of evidence, it is very important that as many regional residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police.
This will help to bring the picture of the situation to the court when we present our case to the court.”

The last day!
They rushed to the fire stations.
In Istanbul last Thursday, thousands of vehicles were damaged, along with the storm and the flooding.
While most of the drivers who received fire reports to be met by insurance companies have made notifications, drivers who have not received reports so far have also gone into the queue for the report.
Drivers who were helmeted today and did not appear in the notification were asked to report by arriving at the fire stations as this was the last day of the notification period.
Today is the last day
The drivers first took pictures of the vehicles to the fire department to identify the damage to their vehicles.
The drivers, who were found damaged by their vehicles, later reported to the officers.
Hasan Erol, who arrived at the fire station for the report, said, "I'm going to take a picture."
There was intensity when I came.
"There was damage to the front window," he said.
Driver Erbil Sword, "We're here to run."
We're in line.
We took the photo.
“We’ll wait for the report,” he said.
Heavens that have walls to the sea and the earth do not breathe
CHP Member of Parliament, Rare Ataman, warned of an earthquake involving huge structures rising on the beach: "The report of the informant in the case clearly states that the earthquake will not stand in the violence of these structures."
It is reported that the rocks that the rock is 25-30 meters below are not dug so deep.
Istanbul Atak<0xC3><0xB6>y, a high-rise hotel and residences on the beach between the sea and the land, left the district breathless.
Rare Ataman, a member of the Assembly of the Municipality of Bak<0xC4><0xB1>rk<0xC3><0xB6>y in the CHP, reacted to the huge AVM, hotel and residence projects that have risen behind one in the district.
Ataman, noting the cut of the wind of the structures on the beach, said: “Eighty years ago, the Atat<0xC3><0xBC>rk Forest was created in Florya by those planning according to the wind.
Eighty years later, when a sense of urbanism was reached, giant skyscrapers in the wind corridors changed their climate.
“There is no breathing in the county,” he said.
Ataman, who stated that buildings rising like walls on the coast of Atak<0xC3><0xB6>y changed the climate balance, continued: “The temperature is felt 10 degrees higher because of the skyscrapers.”
These buildings must be made according to the direction of the winds.
But our skyscrapers are rising above Istanbul's wind corridors.
The wind doesn't enter the county.
These structures disrupt the natural balance of life.
Ataman said that these skyscrapers, which harm the environment and human health, also cut off the connection of the people of Bak<0xC4><0xB1>rk<0xC3><0xB6>y with the sea, would appeal to the Committee of Monuments on the subject and go to court.
Unsurgical treatment is possible on the return of hair.
In the case of phenolic application, success is seen to be as high as 83 percent.
In this method, the diseased tissue is effectively cleaned and the tissue gap is filled with an agent that kills hair roots.
One of the techniques of non-operative hair removal treatment is laser method.
With various lasers, the hair roots and surrounding tissue are burned by circularly spread rays, and during this burning it is ensured that the tissues are closed by sticking.
Thanks to these two non-operative methods of hair loss, patients can return to their social and business lives in a shorter time.
Dr. Mert Atak noted that excessive weight, immobile life, prolonged sitting, not doing work, not following the rules of hygiene with intense hair and body coat, found disorders such as pain, infection, apnea and swelling among the symptoms of the disease.
Italy Confirms Approach of STKs to Migrant Rescue Boots
Italy has warned STKs operating an migrant rescue boat in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue if they do not comply with new rules that affect their operations.
In an interview with Torino newspaper La Stampa, Interior Minister Marco Minniti said: “It will be difficult to see if the STCs continue to operate if they don’t fit into the new ring.”
Minniti's warning came a day after a boat operated by the Italian authorities, the German aid agency Jugend Rettet, was handed over to the crew on suspicion that it had cooperated effectively with human smugglers in order to facilitate illegal migration.
The aid agency, which had been active for only a year, declined to comment on the content of the detailed allegations directed against them by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
The organization said in a statement on social media: “For us, saving human life is our most important priority, and it will be so, so we’re very sorry that we can’t work in the search and rescue area right now.”
"We can only assess the allegations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and been able to assess the situation."
Italian authorities have been tracking Jugend Rettet's boat Iuventa since October.
It is suspected that the crew took them aboard a migrant vessel full of rubber boots delivered directly by human smugglers, and that the smugglers allowed them to escape again with boats.
According to the prosecutor’s files published by the Italian media, at least one such meeting took place about 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya.
The crew is under no illusions as to the authority of the Italian coast security, which has resorted to rescue operations in the region due to a lot of humanitarian efforts for another purpose.
According to the ring, there had to be an Italian police officer on the deck of boats like Iuventa, who was clearly monitoring their activities.
Only three of the nine STKs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
Last Tuesday, he said he considered the new rules to be unnecessary but acceptable because his own rescue operations would not cause any "serious change or obstacle."
Those who refuse to sign up for the Nobel Prize-winning organization include Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp drop in the number of migrants arriving in Italy after rescues in recent weeks was indicative of efforts to strengthen coastal security in Libya and of cooperation with local governors.
The minister said, "In the last few days we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel."
This month, he announced plans to hold more talks with Libyan governors on economic development initiatives and to take measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe with Chad, Niger and Mali.
Last-minute punch!
The Russian capital was drunk of turmeric, as it did every year in the celebration of the "day of paratrooper units" in Moscow.
Nikita Razvozjayev, a Russian NTV reporter who broadcast live at a Russian Gorky Park that was involved in the event and who was over-abducting alcohol, attacked the reporter of Russian TV NTV.
The reporter, who broadcasts the developments of the day on the live broadcast, suddenly noticed and shouted, "We're going to block Ukraine," warned the man, "Please shut up."
The drunk man, who was a former parachute, hit him hard on the reporter's warning.
The reporter with the punch he got tried to get away from the man.
Millions of people watched the moment of shock live.
Economic Coordinating Board Meeting
The Economic Coordination Board (ECC) met under the chairmanship of Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek, responsible for the economy.
Following the cabinet change in the government, the first EKK meeting in <0xC3><0x87>ankaya K<0xC3><0xB6><0xC5><0x9F>k<0xC3><0xBC>, which was held in the <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek presidency, began at 6.30 p.m.
The meeting will address Turkey’s macroeconomic outlook.
At the meeting under the chairmanship of <0xC5><0x9E>imke<0xC4><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>, Finance Minister Nazi A<0xC4><0x9F>bal, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Farouk <0xC3><0x96>zl<0xC4><0xB1>, Minister of Labour and Social Security J<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC4><0xB1>ide Sar<0xC4><0xB1>ero<0xC4><0x9F>lu, Minister of Customs and Trade B<0xC3><0xBC><0xC5><0x9F>ent<0xC4><0xB1>k<0xC4><0xB1>, Minister of Development L<0xC3><0xBC>efi El<0xC4><0xB1>ce, Minister of M<0xC3><0xBC>e
It is possible to get rid of the belly button in 45 minutes.
Noting that only 5% of patients should be operated on in the treatment of the pelvic cavity, Dr. O<0xC4><0x9F>uz Karaeminov<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1> says, "The first step is rest and drug treatment according to the patient's examination and imaging results."
According to O<0xC4><0x9F>uz Karaemino<0xC4><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>, if it is necessary to call experimental methods (epidural injection, radiofrequency techniques, in-disc experiments) in the group of patients where the pain continues, then if the success of all these methods is not achieved, then the
Karaemino sons said that it is possible to get rid of the disease in 45 minutes from the disease of the calf, which is currently the least risk-lowering of the 'full-blown butt operation' by means of experimental methods.
Although fairly good results are obtained in relation to open surgery with microscopic surgery, some complications such as long recovery period after surgery, stiffness in the spine, hip recurrence, and progressive back spraining and infection can occur.
Often microscopic surgery is defined as ‘closed surgery’, but microscopic surgery is also applied with the same approach as open surgery.
In the operation of a fully closed butt joint, these risks are eliminated as environmental tissues are protected.
The operation of a full-blown butt plug takes only 45 minutes.
the Special Commission 's
The commission will be attended by members of the CHP Mehmet G<0xC3><0xB6>kda<0xC4><0x9F>, Cemal Okan Y<0xC3><0xBC>ksel, Peace Partner and High Disciplinary Board member Turan Aydo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
Commission, Berbero<0xC4><0x9F>lu on October 4, Istanbul 14.
He will also follow up with his trial in the Heavy Penal Court and his applications to the Constitutional Court and the District Court of Appeal.
The CHP Secretary-General Kamil Okyay N<0xC4><0xB1>nd<0xC4><0xB1>r and the Vice-President-General B<0xC3><0xBC>lent Tezcan's signature on the order read: "The independence and impartiality of the court is the indispensable condition of justice that it does not take orders from anywhere outside the law."
"Our MP, Mr. Enis Berbero<0xC4><0x9F>lu, did not ask for any special status when he was acting as a Member of Parliament, he did not seek refuge in the immunity of the Member of Parliament, he wanted to preserve his belief in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary," he said.
It was suggested that the court preferred the application of political orders rather than the court’s judgment.
In the article, it was argued that, despite the decisions of the Constitutional Court that the arrest had been made before the finalization of the sentence, there was clear evidence that the court had decided under the influence of the court.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to life in prison for messages encouraging Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now in her 20s, will be serving a 15-month sentence behind bars and serving a five-year sentence.
In June, Carter was convicted of the murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Mr. Roy's father said at Thursday's hearing, "My family's heart was broken.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to be released so that his way of revenge would be open.
Though Azami faced a 20-year sentence, the legal team claimed that he and Mr. Roy suffered from mental illness.
Carter, wearing a red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, had his hands bent and his eyes looked down at the ground with old eyes as he was being beaten to the ground.
The prosecutor told the court, "His actions killed Conrad Roy."
He ended his life in order to heal himself.
He did not accept responsibility.”
"He never showed any regrets."
But Carter's lawyer said, "It was a terrible situation where his wife was completely sorry."
What’s more, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he didn’t see “any significant impact on his age, level of maturity, or even mental illness.”
A lawyer, Mr. Roy’s mother Lynn Roy, said in a statement: “One day I will not regret the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I have overcome everything. I am trying to be with his sisters with all the pain we will carry forever.”
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would never attend her brother's wedding or that her children would never be able to "get out of their minds."
“It’s a pain that will always be with me for the rest of my life that the person you’ve been with every day since I was born.”
It seems like a lawsuit would create intoxication because there is no Massachusetts law that is guilty of telling a person to commit suicide.
Mr. Roy was 17 years old when he was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.
When the case revealed that Carter's short messages encouraged him to end his own life, he was of national interest.
While on vacation with her family, in many of the messages she sent two weeks before her death, she said: "There are many ways to get out of a building, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know."
In the moments before his suicide, he wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad," and "You'll be free and happy to open the generator that you just have to do."
Judge Moniz ordered him not to be allowed to get out of this case by the press, saying Carter wanted to be interested in Mr. Roy's death.
The case split their legal opinions.
Among the minority who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was found guilty of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, wrote in the Los Angeles Times, “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison.”
Mehmet <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek's stunning growth forecast
In his statement, <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek said that inflation in Turkey should go down to low single-digit figures, saying that food inflation constitutes a “risk zone”.
The deputy prime minister predicts that inflation will fall below 7 percent in 2018.
During the speech, he said:
The next 12 months of uncertainty are critical.
The biggest incentive is to reduce uncertainties.
There is a strong government.
There is no political uncertainty.
I hope that the uncertainties in our close geography will also decrease.
By increasing our resistance to shocks with a number of reforms, I believe that we are setting Turkey on a growth trend of over 5 percent.
I told you months ago.
The worst is left behind.
Gradually, we are no longer in those areas, but in the reforms that will enable our energy to grow, to increase employment.
That's why the next 12 months are critical.
On the one hand, reform, on the other hand, there is no political uncertainty.
We hope that our chances of success will be reduced by the troubles in our immediate region.
Whether we like it or not, many of our classic markets have collapsed.
Libya, like Iraq.
We’re not just losing on Sundays, we’re facing an immigration wave of over 3.5 million.
When we looked at the last 15 years, Turkey grew by 5.7 percent despite all these shocks.
Turkey, that is, we have solid problems.
Now, by increasing our resistance to shocks with some reforms, a number of investors are more likely to go beyond the question marks in the minds of Turkey’s growth policy of over 5 percent again.
Let's face it, we have such a generous retirement system.
If I say our retirement companies aren't doing enough, I think it makes sense.
One time, the performance in the car will be strong.
Why?
Because we took action.
Companies don't have to go out and make an effort.
We have been monitoring these concerns, taking into account that performance is weak, and we have been working on how to allocate global assets to which investment areas.
You know, the supplies are high.
Once clearly given by the state, in addition to 25 percent, there will be a performance there.
The rest of the money is usually on the paper, and the risk is usually low.
When we look at the big picture, I think that interest will increase in the next period.
Because they'll see the performance.
There is no failure in the other field, there is success.
We restructured the BES in 2013.
It has 6.8 million participants, a savings of 70 billion lira.
You're right, the system has been successful.
It also has 2.6 million participants in automatic participation and a deposit of 775 million lira.
We want a little more effort from the companies.
Let them advertise a little, let them tell you about this system.
We're working during the kayaking season.
Maybe if we put some pressure on him...
We'll see, we're working.
Maybe the citizens see the delivery and the accumulation and stay in the system.
Out of the system, 38 percent.
Almost half of those who have left are those who have voluntary individual retirement.
You don't want two individual retirement accounts.
What are you doing?
You're leaving my car.
We were actually expecting a drop of around 10 percent.
And that means we're very optimistic.
Once the system works.
We've got a prime roof.
Insurance companies sometimes explain the one-sided.
They increased their primes very quickly.
When we asked what was going on, they said the court rulings didn't take into account the existing regulations.
We've made a new clean-up.
We told you to do the right thing.
They said no, we'll wait for the trial.
We said it wouldn't be like that.
We've got a difference of opinion here.
Of course, some companies also refused to apply this ceiling premium.
We made a new arrangement.
We've created a pool of risky insurers.
I'll say it, I'll say it again.
I prefer this system to work through competition.
So I don't find these ceiling price applications right, they forced us.
I'd like a three-dimensional look at this.
Let's take into account the system we're making.
Two, let the system run normally, that's a price tag on that trail.
In addition to his heavy loads, every 100 lira premium paid goes to almost 30-31 lira tax SGK cuts.
I'm working right now, and we're going to talk to our finance minister.
Thirdly, the technology is rapidly evolving.
Over time, traffic accidents will also be significantly reduced structurally.
But this is mandatory traffic insurance.
In the morning, he saved his leg.
Buerger’s disease, which emerged from the age of puberty, was a disorder that was once seen in men, but it is now often seen in women as well.
One of these women is a 36-year-old Mehtap.
The pain that began two years ago was chronicled on the base of the foot.
When the young woman who was forced to walk faced the risk of losing her leg, she went to the hospital.
A friend of mine suggested Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko.
He showed the news of 'Azerbaijan's Minister of Extraordinary Situations saved his life'.
It turned out that Dursun, who went to Kalko, was struggling with Buerger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko took the young woman to emergency surgery.
After a short while, you'll be relieved of your pain, now you see oxygen treatment.
Automakers Will Modify 850,000 Diesel Vehicles While Opposed to Reverse Impact by Audi
A day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of BMW’s board of directors, including Munich, said that the company believes there are “more intelligent options than driving restrictions,” including BMW’s central (which is thought to be the ban or restriction of diesel vehicles).
Daimler said on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe will be modified to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies described these moves as a callback.
European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But the nitric oxides that diesel engines reveal are called cancer-causing, and can cause hangovers.
The cost of equipment that automotive companies need to put on to neutralize the dirty smoke that diesel vehicles remove is also increasing, making it difficult for cars to remain competitive.
While German automakers faced scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government was also accused of defrauding powerful car companies and ignoring the orders of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which, while hiding and testing emissions, uses a device known as a faulty device and, while an automobile is being tested, adjusts the emissions to fit the regulations and relaxes it under normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen managers have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in Audi’s engine development division, the former president of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and therefore not protected against his return of the culprit and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a German criminal investigation, including Volkswagen, after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to get rid of the emission rules in Europe and expanded the U.S.-based investigation.
Audi's involvement in the investigation can be difficult for Volkswagen: the luxury carmaker has an excessive share in Volkswagen's profits.
Don't skip fishing every time you see
Prof. Dr. Yusuf <0xC5><0x9E>ukr<0xC3><0xBC> <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, President of the Turkish Society of Neurosurgery, warned that fishing in shallow places of more than 2 meters is not guaranteed.
Every year, thousands of people face the risk of paralysis due to neck fracture and spinal damage due to diving into shallow waters.
Neck fractures most often develop on the 5th or 6th vertebrae.
The feature of fractures affects the nerves that feed the arm and leg muscles as well as the respiratory muscles at this level.
Prof. Dr. <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, "The neck vertebrae, our most valuable organ in these types of accidents, are cut off or blocked by a fractured spine."
"The wrong first aid in fatal injuries can lead to death, not only by increasing the damage in accidents," he said.
Diving into the water is ranked fourth in spinal cord injuries.
The average age of the injured is 20-29 and the majority are male.
Prof. Dr. <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, "Fishing in invisible water should not be skipped."
"No matter how well you dive, you can have a serious injury," he said.
Prof. Dr. <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar also recalled the following:
Depending on the degree of vertebral damage in the place where it is causing the injury while fishing, vertebrae can develop in different degrees in the arms and legs.
You may know swimming, but water can be deceptive.
A place that may seem deep to you.
The warning signs placed on the sea shores in the US and Australia have seen a 70 percent reduction in cases of shallow-water fishing jumping.
Prof. Dr. <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, "Although there has been a sea coast in Turkey for 28 years, unfortunately there is not even a single warning sign in places outside Istanbul."
“With regard to these types of accidents in life, every year before each summer, under the Health Department, schools and social awareness project, information lights or information panels should be placed in the beaches and pools,” he said.
T<0xC3><0x9C>RK Neurosurgery Association Spinal and Peripheral Nervous Surgery Group Chairman Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil suggested that the following should be done in the event of injury:
The first thing you need to do is call 112 immediately.
The neck should be kept as steady as possible, should not be moved, should be detected with a hard collar.
The airway should be provided and the patient should be placed on the opposite side for drainage of the water that escapes into the lungs.
It should not be taken off the legs and rubbed to empty the water.
The shape of the patient's neck should not be attempted to correct.
Your neck may have been broken.
However, if the spine has not yet been damaged, an inappropriate position to be given to the neck during the first aid and the patient's move may cause fractured bone pieces to press into the spine and cause damage.
Provence lavender under threat of climate change
It had become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is under threat of climate change.
Lavanta is experiencing a decline due to drought-like conditions and insects carrying disease, and this causes a major headache for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: “The lavender in Provence is in effective danger because in recent years, the plant has been affected by the impacts of much less rainfall in the spring and mostly in the fall.
This affects the life of the lavender.
There’s also a small August bug that’s a leaf-damaging virus that transmits microbacteria, and there’s a lot of them in very dry weather.”
And a lot of things are in danger.
For as much perfume and cosmetics as vacationers draw, lavender oil is a great pursuit.
Eric Chaisse said: “While we need to have very long plant heads with a few large flowers, we have smaller, less developed or no or weak heads.
So we have less essential oily parts."
Among the solutions that are passed through the eye involves better water distribution and slower evaporation from the soil, but there is also a protective balm and water mixture for plants to spray and develop more resistant species to dry conditions.
Reporter's murder paints the gold of Mexico's growing threat
The weekly newspaper Riodoce's staff usually meet on Wednesday to review the latest squabbles brought about by organized crime in Sinaloa state to review plans for illegal officials and non-stop drug wars in the newspaper.
But on this day, they came together to talk about their safety in the shadow of their own tragedies.
They were told that it was important for them to change their routine.
Two senior journalists see what makes them feel safer: whether to bring their children with them to the office, which was the target of a hand bomb in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard in front of the room: rebels, neutrals, allies.
They want reporters to suggest names for each column; there is no need for any evidence, perceptions and inner voices are enough.
Suspected drug smugglers, politicians, business people, government, or cartels are the bad guy who makes a list full of Mexico’s chaos in the paper dangerous to the writing business.
There is no violence, while the number of bodies is increasing across the country, more of them are journalists: According to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, President Enrique Pena Nieto has killed at least 25 people since taking office in December 2012; at least 589 people have died in federal custody since the attack and after the threats.
Among the last dead are writing directors and inspirational sources of Riodoce founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
Valdez writes in one of his many books on drug violence, “The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist.”
His absence is deeply felt, but his presence is everywhere, hanging on the facade of Riodoce's building with the word "Justice" with a large photo showing Valdez's middle finger; two of the 30's reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, his smile on his face, and his smile on his brow.
The work takes place two months after his death; reporters talk about their common traumas, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was set up in 2010 to deal with journalistic cases, only two were sacked, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Every year, as in most of the thousands of crimes linked to drug smuggling and organized crime, the killers of journalists are rarely brought before the law.
In Riodoce; although their hearts are broken, they insist on resorting to violence in Sinaloa, even though the ground is now more treacherous.
“Without knowledge about the killers, without justice, it’s very little to talk about security,” Ibarra says.
"It's stupid to waste my time on this job," he says.
“As long as we don’t know why, you don’t trust anyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the state capital.
The Red Toyota Corolla could only last a few blocks before being stopped by two men; it was forcibly removed from its vehicle and shot 12 times, in the name of its newspaper, which was translated as the presumed Eleventh River.
The gunman drove away in his car and hit the car nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
His wife and two adult children remain.
In Culiacan, they say they tend to roam freely.
But there is almost nothing but silence about Valdez.
After Guzman's arrest last year and his return to the United States in January, rival groups fought to fill the void, while Sinaloa became one of the country's bloodiest battlefields.
In Sinaloa, every day one or many people on the street get shot and killed, or the cute, two-story drug lords of the cemetery are filled with bigger mossols than many houses to live in.
For a minute, forget about the “suicide” state that only one cartel controls valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was deeply aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce’s founding partner and director, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, was dropped from the blame for failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contribute to the murder.
The first was an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of Guzman's rival cartel groups, in a February issue.
This article may have angered his sons; likely gang members bought every copy of the press distributed to newspaper publishers and undistributed.
The second mistake, after being handed over to another newspaper in which the same story takes place, was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a turning point in Mexico’s melancholy violence against journalists.
He had survived for a very long time, and his friends and business associates had assumed that he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter in Noroeste in 2013 when he joined his five business friends in selling $50 shares in Riodoce's unveiling.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without talking about drugs," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper gained fame for its brave and honest news and increased advertising with sales.
Reporters loved to publish lifesaving research without the fear of censorship, and readers took themselves to a publication where they could read stories that no one could dare to report.
Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for journalism in Latin America eight years after its establishment.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Committee for the Protection of Journalists’ Freedom of the Press Award for showing the courage to stop pursuing the drug where the end of Mexico’s drug history is based.
She clearly admitted that she was afraid.
During the CPJ awards, he said, "I want to keep living."
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, drug smuggling in Sinaloa was said to be "a way of life."
"As a journalist, you must accept the task that falls on you, whether you're playing this or that stupid.
I don't want him to ask me, 'What were you doing in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what happened?'"
Riodoce's staff misses Valdez; he's a disgraced joker, his friends who are generous in hugs and advice, his teachers who know how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went to a bar called El Guayabo in front of the office and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask: Did his love for his routine come down?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions as to how best to do their jobs and survive.
"If you deal with their wives, their children, their clean jobs, the secret airstrips they use to pump drugs, they don't like it."
Bojorquez said, "These things crossed the line."
The result was a high-grade ottoman even at the best of times and he couldn’t protect himself.
To trust their own instincts.
If bad smells come, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, director of Riodoce's writing business, said, "It's a smell-inducing sensation... and it happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules did not apply in Sinaloa; just as the lucrative smuggling routes, which are Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and a toxic mix, are not valid in other states that host weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The ground is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff meet for security training, no cell phone is allowed; days ago, it turned out that the spy software sold only to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Out there, two police officers wanted to get rid of a 104-degree (40-centigrade) temperature in the shade of a tree.
Riodoce was assigned by the state government to protect his office in a four-storey building in a middle-class citadel of Culiacan.
The half-song was half-serious, some of the reporters were wondering if these officers were among the police within 50 percent of what the governor himself said was unreliable.
Reporters have spent months in the mountainous countryside, which is controlled by drug gangs.
In this week's issue, Riodoce has three main stories.
Former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was murdered in Sinaloa.
In addition, there was a revelation of the governor's concentrated government spending on his homeland.
And beyond a block from the prosecution, there was the kidnapping of a group at Culiacan's most expensive restaurant.
There was no official explanation as to who was kidnapped or how it was, so when it came time to write what everyone in the city knew: the restaurant was the eye of both drug smugglers and authorities.
One reporter learned from official records that the menu of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated almost every step of the restaurant policy of the last century, was registered under the name of a politician.
Recently, many PRI governors have been accused of corruption in sensational events.
Villareal asked reporters at the scene to write about the events that had taken place before, including the escape of one of Guzman's sons, including one of his sons, at a military press conference.
Only months ago, they were reading, looking at Valdez's corner for the best source of information on kidnapping.
Due to its fine structure, Villareal (46), nicknamed "El Flaco," said, "We already knew what happened before."
"All of our communication channels with our sources have now been cut off."
The staff are re-using it as a warehouse for banners and pick-ups protesting Valdez's journalistic killings as they turn into activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez caught a couple of banners and showed up the next morning for another journalist at the local prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in Michoacan state in the west.
A burned body was found, and officials say it's him, according to DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have voiced their thoughts on the protests, and have written “Helping the Press” on uprisings and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is trying to provide international support for justice in Washington, D.C., in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the eve of Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that day, he asked the government to assign him a task other than to do the news, thinking that his anger was eroding impartiality.
Valdez continued to say that journalists in Mexico are "involved" by organized crime, official officials, and a carefree society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists were being killed not only by drug gangs, but by orders from politicians and security forces in co-operation with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 linked most of the attacks on journalists last year to police and official officials.
Ramirez said, "You're going to die in Mexico because they want to silence you."
The murders have clearly had a cold shower effect.
Six years ago, blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias died in Tamaulipas, the northern border state of Macias.
The body was found with a note signed by the Zetas cartel saying, "I'm here because of my news."
A computer keyboard and earpiece are aligned next to the broken head.
In the northern border state of Chihuahua, the reporter Miroslava Breach chose to close some publications, such as El Norte, after he was killed in March.
After the killing of his directors in 2004, the rest of Nuevo Laredo, as El Manana did.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez called the drug cartels with the headline on the front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their own states, or even the country.
It's a decision.
It's hard to find jobs in exile and they're still wandering the streets waiting for danger.
Sometimes, three months after fleeing Veracruz, they are captured as an accomplice by photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City with four women in 2015.
It is a dance made every day with these high-risk decisions for those who stay behind and continue to work.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says he was afraid to report drug trafficking.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
One Saturday night in the recent past, while preparations were being made for the completion of the final count, Riodoce began to steal the phones while executives were sitting on the sidewalk outside the office and drinking beer.
A series of armed clashes, including rival gangs and security forces, near Mazatlan, a beach resort, have resulted in 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to rage, as promised, in a series of cartel messages surrounding it.
They put the news on Riodoce's website via cell phones on the sidewalk.
The front page would remain in the condition of being changed the next day.
Sirens began to pass nearby, there's another gun conflict in the neighborhood.
Bojorquez quickly checked the police officers to see if they were on the alert.
If they were scared, they wouldn't even show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the vengeful founders of his newspapers, his middle finger was displayed to see all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff was following in his footsteps.
"How can you think of closing," said Bojorquez, "on the day Javier was killed, while the intern wanted me to send him out on the street to let him know?"
He used camouflage to avoid his dinosaur enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, but it looks like a terrible one.
The researchers now explain that the first findings of an incredible creature of the size of a spine, now found by a Canadian miner, have been very well preserved, with experts describing it as the ‘Mona Lisa’ of dinosaurs.
It was so well preserved that they could understand that the money leather was reddish brown, and they could say it was a ‘problem past’.
The report in the journal Current Biology described it as “the best-preserved armed dinosaur and one of the best dinosaur species in the world.”
Fossil is a newly discovered species of nodozore that lived 110 million to 112 million years ago since the middle of the Cretaceous Period.
The unusually well-preserved condition surprised the researchers, who described it as 'really wonderful'.
The plant-eating weapon is the best-preserved fossil of its kind, according to reports in National Geographic.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the rock around him, he hit something that looked strange and decided to look closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Over the next 6 years, they spent 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of land, revealing the wild animal from within.
After such an intense study, the completed result is now ready to appear.
Lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creation was exhibited, said: “If you cut your eyes a little bit, you can even believe he’s almost asleep.”
"One of the most beautiful in the history of science, and the best preserved dinosaur species, will become the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
The researchers looked at the skin and found that although it was covered with rust, and resembled a walking tank, this plant was likely facing a serious threat from dinosaurs who ate meat.
He used red and white camouflage to hide from predators who were quite heavily armored, and he used a protective technique that many modern-day animals also use.
Experts suggest that it is hunted by larger dinosaurs, making it possible for it to better blend in and out of their enemies.
The creature, from a 110 million-year-old nodozo family, first appeared in headlines in May and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The researchers have now completed their work and named the museum technician Mark Mitchell, who was one of the team that spent more than 7,000 hours working hard to uncover it, the wild animal Borealopelta markedly.
The extraordinary preservation of the species was made possible by Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists, the shape and pattern of the money and the documentation of weapons on the body.
They discovered counter-darkness, which is a common defense method in the animal realm and means that the upper part of the creature is darker by the bottom.
While counter-darkening is common, the findings are surprising because the size of Borealopelta exceeds many of the counter-darkening animals that are alive today.
This means that the dinosaur has seen enough pressure from the meat-eating dinosaurs to hunt, and that evolution has tended to confront hiding as a way of survival.
But the most modern animals that use counter-shadowing (e.g. deer, zebras or armadillos) are much smaller and are much more likely to be a hunter; it means that this nodozer has faced a serious challenge to survive.
“The huge, powerful hunting exercise on a heavy-armed animal shows how dangerous dinosaur predators in Cretese can be,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds in their silver also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for its tips on life, including preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate at its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and dragged into the sea, where it sank to the surface of the ocean on its back.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today, and it probably spread into much more interiors than rivers and oceans are now.
"Nodozore is really worth considering because it's completely covered and protected with pulled skin, but also the original shape of the animal is protected in a 3-dimensional way," Brown said.
“The result is that the animal looks almost the same as it does in early Cretaceous.
You don’t need too much imagination to rebuild it; if you cut your eyes a little, you can believe it’s almost dormant.”
Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, standing on two feet, were traveling on Earth.
Although all of them were kings, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the armored dinosaur Borealopelta, which may have been hunted by a group of giant ancestors.
Among them is an Acrocanthosaurus, a monster weighing 6 tons, 38 ft (11.5 m) in length.
The latest findings, published in the journal Current Biology, suggest that Borealopelta was dragged to sea after her death and mummified in mud.
The creature was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in Northern Alberta, Canada, when he excavated the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray.
According to the museum, the best-preserved armored dinosaur, including skin and armor, is complete from the nose to the hip.
The creature weighs an average of 18 ft. (five meters) and up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
You have two 20-inch-long necks coming out of your shoulders.
The researchers believe that this armored grain of oatmeal roamed the site of the current Western Canada until it was pulled out by a river that carries it to the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater grave armor was preserved in perfect detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular species are so well preserved that the skin fragments still cover the entire armor layers throughout the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, this degree of conservation "is as rare as winning a pinago.
The more I look at him, the more incredible it is.
The fossilized skin fragments still cover the entire armor layer, which is located in the dinosaur's skull.
The right front leg is lying next to it, five fingers upwards.
I can count the money on the base."
Don't be your bitch when I say white.
White teeth and an aesthetic smile are every man's dream.
While people are resorting to all sorts of ways to whiten their teeth, the president of the Oral Laser Applications Association, N<0xC3><0xBC>khet Berk, warns that they should stay away from products sold on the market or on the internet.
Nikhet Berk, noting that these types of materials are painted on the surface of the mine, so that the teeth are colored so that they will not turn back again, says the fine porcelain surfaces that can be worn "whitening of teeth, with chemicals applied by dentists, or sticking nails on the surface of teeth."
Berk, who noted that the preservation of dental health prevents many diseases from forming, and that aesthetic practices are important in terms of mental health, both in terms of dental and dental health, as well as in terms of a beautiful smile:
Unless there is a disorder or genetic factor in the structure of the teeth, the teeth of young people are usually white.
Due to aging, drawing of dental mines, and frequent consumption of cigarettes, tanning or dark-colored beverages, teeth get darker in years.
Whitening of the teeth can be provided with chemicals applied by dentists or with thin porcelain surfaces that are applied to the surface of the teeth without minimal or no abrasion, such as sticking nails.
Teeth should never be whitened with products sold on the market or on the internet.
Because these substances draw the surface of the mine, the teeth are colored so that there will be no return.
Since 2011, the municipality of Kechi<0xC3><0xB6>ren has been providing the “Home Dental and Oral Health Service” to elderly, disabled and sleepy citizens.
65-year-old K<0xC3><0xB6>ksal G<0xC3><0xBC>ng<0xC3><0xB6>r, who has been sentenced to 24 years in prison in Ke<0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xB6>ren’s Awakening District, “My wife was informed of this service of Ke<0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xB6>ren Municipality.”
We called the town, they came right away.
“It’s already below my neck and thanks to this service, I don’t neglect dental care at all,” he said.
Kezban G<0xC3><0xB6>k<0xC3><0xA7>e, the 72-year-old daughter of G<0xC3><0xBC>lizar Ta<0xC5><0x9F><0xC3><0xA7>i<0xC3><0xA7>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu, 95, who lives in P<0xC4><0xB1>narba<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1> Mahallesi, said: “My mother has been bed-dependent for 7.5 years because of her age.”
When I came to the city, I saw the signs of this service and immediately called.
We have been receiving this service regularly for 4 years.
I have problems with my teeth, and doctors look at me when I get there.
He used the phrase "very pleased."
There is no health insurance requirement for a service that is completely free of charge.
"Grandma" incident in the Turkish army
My dear readers, very interesting decisions were made at the High Military Council (YA<0xC5><0x9E>) meeting the previous day, especially in terms of the Navy.
This was brought to the command of the Force, not an oramiral, but a coramiral.
This is an almost never-before-seen practice in our army.
So how did that happen?
The commander of the force, Oramiral B<0xC3><0xBC>lent Bostano<0xC4><0x9F>lu, was already retired.
And it happened.
Now the order of command had come to Veysel K<0xC3><0xB6>sele, the only oramiral.
Veysel Pasha, who had been a kumbassian in the past and had been incarcerated for some time, was to be the commander in the normal command.
But the government didn't want him.
I'm trying to tell you in detail, if we start from the top in the Marines, the commanders Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 5 are not promoted.
In this case, there was only one admiral left in the Marines.
He had to be brought to the vacant office: Naval Commander Oramiral Veysel K<0xC3><0xB6>sele in number two.
So what happened next?
Koramiral Adnan <0xC3><0x96>zbal, who was in sixth rank, was appointed by that ruling government.
Now look at this painting!
Oramiral Veysel K<0xC3><0xB6>sele stands there, but he's appointed a lower-ranking commander instead!
A senior, he's following your senior's orders.
What will happen after that?
An oramiral who is superior to Rutbece, does not act on the orders of a feared general who is inferior to him, he cannot do so.
He doesn't take orders from her, he can't.
In this case, Veysel K<0xC3><0xB6>sele will not succumb to this instigating condition, if he is not retired, he will resign today or tomorrow.
This is the message that the government has already given him: “Goodbye Veysel Pasha!”
The news that he was resigning in the afternoon when I wrote this article yesterday was spreading, but the situation had not yet been officially clarified.
Now let's look at these things again!
The government opposed Veysel K<0xC3><0xB6>sele for this or that reason, did not want to, forced him to resign, and instead brought to the command a 6th rank coral reef and entrenched the traditional concept of our army "K<0xC4><0xB1>dem".
There’s politics in the business, and we don’t know the back of the curtain.
Maybe if he tells someone soon, we'll all learn together!
My dear readers, I have tried to tell you very briefly above, especially in the Turkish army, the incident of seniority is very important.
Not just as a ranking.
For example, the officer who graduated from Harp School in 10th place is higher than the officer who graduated in 11th.
The one who promotes the first ordinary to the generality is greater than the one who promotes the second.
We have seen some examples of this great event in <0xC4><0xB0>stiklal Harbin.
Commander of the Garp Front, Ismet Pasha...
There are two armies on your command.
The Army and the 2nd Army.
We've come to 1922, our armies will carry out a great siege and hunt down the Greek army.
At this stage, there are valuable names that are expected to be assigned to the military command.
One of them is Pasha.
He's offered military command, but he says, "The army is too weak for me, I can't follow his orders."
Another name is Yakub Shevki (Subsidiary) Pasha.
Professor at Atat<0xC3><0xBC>rk's Harp Academy...
A valuable and distinguished commander, whom he loved so much, valued, whom he called "the Master", who participated in various wars.
In 1919, he was captured and driven to the island of Malta by the British along with military and civilian Turkish lights.
When he returned home, he was reluctant to take command of the army and said the same thing: "The commander of the Western Front is inferior to me, I cannot order him."
However, Atat<0xC3><0xBC>rk congratulates him and Yakub <0xC5><0x9E>evki Pa<0xC5><0x9F>a accepts the command of one of our two armies.
The third is a very colorful name...
Ali Ihsan (Sabis) Pasha.
He's a very talkative, constantly critical soldier.
A commander who fought in Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran and various fronts.
He is also exiled by the British to Malta, where he escapes and comes to Ankara via his homeland.
When he was offered command of the army, Ali <0xC4><0xB0>hsan Pasha also said the same thing: "I cannot fight at the command of Ismet, who is less than me."
But he's convinced...
But come and see that, after he begins his mission, he constantly discusses with the Garp Front commander Ismet Pasha, who is in command of the Garp Front, and brings out the incident and disturbs the army...
And shortly before the big tararu<0xC5><0xA1>a, he is retired and replaced by a bearded Nurettin Pa<0xC5><0xA1>a.
Later, Ali Ihsan never improves between the pasha and Atat<0xC3><0xBC>rk.
The problem of seniority in the Turkish army is not only in war, but also in peace.
Of course he needs to get out.
Veysel K<0xC3><0xB6>sele is the last example of this.
How did an activist get to know the answer to the question "Who are the streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
The day after he came to New York City to travel, he sat on the bed of Airbnb, rented by St. Louis locals, and began to travel on his phone on Facebook.
It's like sharing someone from high school.
“The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he’s still lying on the street,” he said.
He was surprised when he realized that no one else had shared this information in the stream of content, shutting down Facebook and opening up Twitter.
A user named <0x40>TheePharoah was continuously retweeted in his content stream.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was tweeting the death of Michael Brown live, aged 18, who was killed in Ferguson Missouri by an unarmed black and white police officer.
Brown, who will be there for four hours, shared a photo of his lifeless body on the street.
Ferrell thought to himself, "It's wild."
But death was nothing new to him or to society.
He left his phone later that evening on Canfield Drive to return to tweets about the gathering of people.
Police tapes, screaming people, and claiming Brown was the father, had photos of a man holding a banner saying, "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son just before!"
A police officer watched a live broadcast with a dog barking in front of a group of protestors.
In another video, another policeman, he said, set the trigger for his gun and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembered saying, "It's not used to."
“It’s not the kind of murder we’re used to and what we might call typical.”
I was scared at the time.
I was angry and I was crying.”
He picked up a return ticket and went home the next day.
She took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house after midnight, and the next morning she decided to go with her to Ferguson.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years will come to the movies on August 11th, the subject of a new documentary, "Who Are the Streets?"
This is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resistance in that society, and of people who fill the streets with answers.
While Ferrell was driving his vehicle to Ferguson with a girl wearing a flowery dress and wearing a matching crown, they returned to talk about the "experiences of blacks and blacks" they had done several times that morning.
“Do you remember what I taught you that black people should fight for what they believe?” he said.
“We’re going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn’t true.
I couldn’t afford it,” Ferrell said later.
“What happens here today is a result of what happened in the past.
He should know it, see it, and grow in it.
Not only should it not develop well in the field of activism and organization, but it should also know what we need to do to know the layers of the black experience and the black situation and liberation, to liberate ourselves.
If I'm lucky enough to have him have an experience where he can't experience rough racism in person, it won't make any difference to any black woman-boy.
I feel that I will protect him from them and make him feel bad.”
When they arrived at Ferguson, their first stop was on the South Florissant Road, which was opposite the police station and which resulted in Officer Darren Wilson not being executed for the crime, which turned into a name camp for activists.
There, Ferrell and his daughter made contact with local business owners who were preparing packaged food.
They prepared the bags and helped to bring them to the protestors.
A new kind of activism was slowly forming for Ferrell.
While a student at Missouri State University, Minority Students were the president of the Nurses Union and focused on food justice and health injustice in black society, he said, "My activism has completely changed since August 9."
“I had no experience in organizing.
He came from himself.”
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, on an evening show.
Folayan said he and his visual director, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, wanted to "confirm" the ending.
Ferrell had a question in his mind: “Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story you can use?”
This suspicion was often reported by a man in countless situations, such as whites; to come to a society and get rid of his pain and resistance.
As Folayan explained in an interview recently: "We heard that people born and growing up in Ferguson were not able to concentrate, and we decided to do it differently."
Folayan had already established a connection with Damon Davis, the co-director of the region known for his activism on the death penalty.
His participation warmed Ferrell to the project, followed by six other locals as well as the "Who Are the Streets?" team in the years following Brown's shooting.
David said, “This is not a document that anyone speaks for us or speaks for us; it is we who speak.”
"That's what's important to me, how these people will be represented because that's how I'll be represented."
Folayan, while not focusing on Ferrell's experiences, showed that the movement was "not about a great leader, it was about society getting together," he proved that the film participants were the most outspoken, he said.
As a result, "Who Are the Streets?" surprisingly documents the personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
Ferrell, who laughed at the finished product at first sight, said, "I felt like naked."
“But while I was doing this and humanizing black people, I realized that there could be some sensitivity.”
Ferrell’s story also reinforces the role of black gay women in the Black Lives Matter movement and puts it back in the spotlight.
Two of the three founders of the movement who coined the slogan #BlackLivesMatter after the murder of black young Trayvon Martin in 2012 described themselves as gay.
“Black gay women in leadership generally kept up the movement,” Ferrell said, “and that’s because we’re constantly at war on many fronts.
Black gay women have to carry all the weight of it."
He added: “The movement is being held up by really black women and many gay black women.”
However, Ferrell insists that "there is nothing in this kind of positive action" and that due to his identity, he is not selected.
He said, “He was the one who put this energy into action.”
“But it’s no coincidence that she’s on the front lines, because as a black gay woman, there’s a lot you’re going to lose by living a life in these interruptions.
You can feel his energy from the screen.”
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras are already gone, but there are disturbing racial connections between the community and the police.
Ferrell's been under surveillance for another 2.5 years for shutting down the highway during a show.
The socio-political atmosphere in the region he calls home is defined by a single word as "compassion".
Still, Ferguson is holding the song he dug into his memory exactly three years ago when he went out on the streets.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our job to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
Kyrie Irving: The world is not round!
Speaking to NBC Sports, Irving said, “The world is not round.”
The world is flat.
They get used to these things by giving people fear.
Oh, man, don't ask too much.
Because the more information you solve, the more information you get.
That's crazy.
Is the world flat?
Or does he turn around in a round way?
I think you should investigate this.
I'm telling you, they're lying to us.
They lied to us, and they used their words.
Irving said, "I believed I wanted to believe for years."
I thought the world was round and round.
Do you really think we're back in the solar system?
There's nothing they send back.
He's not coming back!
The information they give us is very inconsistent.
The truth is here.
You just have to look for this truth.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?" he said.
Kyrie Irving, who claims the world is flat, is battling the Cleveland Cavaliers this season with a 24.4 number and a 5.9 assist average.
Related: Artist Uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to Create Portraits
In the middle of the room at the New York Fridman Gallery there are many hundreds of white, black and brown, each shrouded over the ceiling wires, all of which resemble almost certain unknowns.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, from the earrings and cut hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning, a former intelligence analyst who was serving a 35-year sentence after leaking secret diplomatic messages via the WikiLeaks website, sent his hair cut from Fort Leavenworth prison.
The name of the new exhibition, which opened on August 2nd, is similar.
This is a product of a two-year correspondence between a trans woman pardoned by Barack Obama and Manning, a leading opponent, who combined his discipline with his expertise in technology, computer science, and art.
Dewey-Hagborg, who created 30 portraits using what a person with this gene data can look like, analyzed the DNA from Manning algorithmically, not only explains the feasibility of the DNA data (there are many ways to interpret it and the determinism of the comments) but also determines its identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but, at a younger age, clearly described herself as a woman, was convicted of 20 crimes in 2013 from six of the Spying Act, computer fraud and theft.
The image was taken under pressure by the prison, so there was only one photo: a sandy, black-and-white selfie in Manning's driver's seat, which was visibly excited, with a missing platinum-yellow wig on it.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg, his project in 2012 was successful with the enormous magic of Strange Precepts.
In this, the artist produced portraits of a picture of what these people might look like, drawing from the castings of cigarette butts and legal pieces like gums.
He just got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
“They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait that could accompany this article,” Dewey-Hagborg said in a press release of the new exhibition.
He couldn’t be visited at the time, he couldn’t be photographed, so they reached Chelsea and asked if he was interested in doing a DNA portrait.
The artist and his incarcerated inspiration became unexpected letter friends by exchanging many letters over the course of two years.
Even illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, they even revealed Pressed Images, a caricature book in which the president pardoned Chelsea's punishment and imagined a future in which his exhibition could be seen in person.
Obama’s request for Manning’s release a few days after he actually launched the book was a happy coincidence after seven ruthless years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump is finding new, tweetable ways to open up war on government leakers and transgender soldiers and to further blind the sharp divisions he wants to repair himself, there is something deep and powerful about this exhibition that is currently open.
When asked about the odd timing of all this, Dewey-Hagborg said, "Events happen for a reason."
An artist's statement written on the wall of his gallery, which Manning's signature on a large scale is beneath it (the point of the letter "i" in his surname is put with the heart), "calls for an end to gender, race, sexuality and culture-based "automatic discrimination".
He has a mitochondrial DNA sequence across the wall: many C's, G's and A's written with bullet pen.
Including 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist’s sophisticated scientific dictionary), Dewey Hagborg wanted to tell how much we all, at least as a biological creation, would be surprised at how similar we are to each other.
“What I hope people get out of this is that our genome doesn’t care about who we are and how clear genetic data is, how subjective it is,” Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Taclit Memories, said.
“DNA data can tell many different stories, and that’s 30 of those stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition held in a single room is a page from the short-line novel that was previously mentioned.
Here, Manning is shown taking a speaker out of the King Kong style, from the United States Discipline Frameworks.
"Did they shut up your speech, or did they win?" he writes.
"So don't ever shut up."
The artist from Philadelphia said, "This came directly from a letter he wrote to me."
"When I'm still talking about it, it's when I'm standing up."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person (as he dreamed of from his caricature book quite predictably) but when he sees it, he will be greeted by masks with his own genetic imitations, collected like a group of protesters in the middle of the room.
Like everything in the exhibition, genetic haplogroups up to the size of Manning (5"2, the size of Manning), which was especially made.
Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits, "I put them on the wall in the past, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd."
“I wanted it to be perceived as a collective movement that was both a movement behind his liberation and a movement that formed with Chelsea.”
Northwestern's Education Officer and Oxford University Employee Seeks Murder
Police said a manhunt was launched across the country for a Northwestern University education officer and Oxford University employee after he was stabbed to death at a luxury apartment in Chicago.
Cook's administrative district records show that on Monday, Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau was arrested for first-degree murder without parole for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56).
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau (26) died after being stabbed several times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said a body was found on July 27.
Officers picked up a phone, reached the Grand Plaza Apartments, and found the victim with many deep cuts in her body.
Official sources said that Cornell-Duranleau was reported to have died at the scene and that detectives were investigating the stabbing as a murder while the police were actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been a lecturer in microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in a statement by email that Lathem was in administrative custody and that he was prohibited from entering Northwestern University campuses.
“This is a criminal case under investigation by the necessary authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation,” he said.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
"We are in touch with the UK police and are ready to help the U.S. investigating authorities in any way they need," he said in a statement by a spokesperson from the University and the University of Somerville.
The statement also said Warren's co-workers were shocked and wanted him to surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, chief of communications from the Chicago Police Department, said the suspects strongly encouraged them to surrender to the authorities.
Guglielmi said, "The police have an idea of where they are, but our efforts to identify them are intensifying."
Guglielmi said he was helping to find suspects from local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi told the Grand Plaza building manager, who had just received a mysterious clue that something was happening in the apartment number 1008, that the police had taken a phone call.
The police described the scene as terrible.
Guglielmi also said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
Lathem and Warren said they were confirmed by security cameras in the building.
Guglielmi said, "We believe that the teaching member Latham has a relationship with the victim."
A statement from the management at the Grand Plaza said: "The police are still working on the victim's timeline and past and are investigating a series of incidents, including a possible family incident."
Italy hands over German ship
Italian police said the ship Iuventa, which was in search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean, had been seized on Lampedusa Island yesterday.
The police, who also shared records of the phone calls that the two members of the organization claimed belonged to, announced that the operation was carried out in the context of an investigation launched in October 2016 under the Trapani Prosecutor's Office.
The members of Jugend Rettet, who were also on the Libyan-Italian line for illegal immigration, said they had brought the refugees they had taken from their boats directly from Libyan human traffickers to Italy at least three times.
Jugend Rettet, who has been questioned by prosecutors, was one of the allegations that he worked with some people from the Libyan Coast Guard.
In a statement issued by the organization, it was noted that their priorities would continue to be to save human life, and that they were assessing the charges against them.
In addition to the ships within the scope of the Italian Coast Guard and the European Union (EU) mission, about 9 international civil society organisations also serve in the search and rescue of refugees in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government had prepared a document of Article 13 of the Code of Conduct for the compliance of these organizations, and it was required to sign it.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will complete the WADA road map in the short term"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said the implementation of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria will not take long for Russia's Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to become operational again.
“A certain stage in the implementation of the road map criteria has been completed, and has obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with RUSADA, UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping).
The WADA road map has been updated in this context," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister was considering the second part of the WADA Regulatory Compliance Road Map, which recently published on the institution’s website, which describes the criteria that govern the reworking of RUSADA.
According to Mutko, this does not include anything to worry about Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future."
What’s more, a criterion that has been mentioned in the list; the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly admit the reported results of the state-backed Russian doping investigation, which was confirmed by WADA, in the Russian sport claimed by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: “While our anti-doping system is accepting a failure, we are conducting an investigation.
All the measures have been implemented.
But there is no state program and we will not accept something that didn’t exist.”
Mutko’s words were echoed by Vitaly Smirnov, chairman of Russia’s Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to RSport in the early hours of the day, Smirnov admitted his past problems with Russia's anti-doping organs but added: "We have said on many occasions that the report contains positions and regulations that create opposition.
No one thinks of accepting the report unconditionally,” Smirnov added.
In November 2005, after the doping scandal in Russia, RUSADA was suspended by WADA for doping controls.
What’s more, international experts and under the supervision of the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) were allowed to schedule and coordinate this June test.
In July, following a visit to the Moscow headquarters, WADA Director Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA was "progressing in the right direction" to re-establish its operations.

Galatasaray President will not return empty-handed
Galatasaray's former president, Faruk S<0xC3><0xBC>ren, harshly criticized the president, Dursun <0xC3><0x96>zbek, who went to Bucharest and Ndiaye for the transfer to the capital Ankara to convince Mircea Lucescu.
Here are the special statements made by the legendary president for the Sabbath readings:
Lucescu-Uzbek interview: "We were finishing when we left."
Galatasaray's president won't go empty-handed, he won't go empty-handed.
Ndiaye transfer: Galatasaray President does not go to the player.
The football player is at the President's feet.
Of course, they meet, or they kiss their hand or they hug...
But whoever the player is, the president doesn't go to his feet.
You're giving <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 million to the player that Osmanlispor bought for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000...
It will be 9 million with 7.5 million bonuses, not 9 million!
You've already made a big investment, of course you're going to play and it's going to be 7.5...
Uzbek’s actions: I don’t want to calm down.
But the job's in the middle.
G.Saray's values are eroded.
It’s not just football, it’s all wrong.
This will be changed by the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors.
But as far as I know, members are happy!
Start-ups That Will Help Your Company Not Be the Next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure her happiness at the e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn’t work.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful, or worse, misleading.
Even if he pledged anonymity, some employees wouldn’t trust him as long as he did.
Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-man e-commerce company based on hair care in San Francisco, says: “There has never been any consistency or objectivity.”
He called someone from the outside for help.
A new type of human resources emerges to make start-up companies understand how their employees feel.
These are the specific purpose of producing software to measure the employment of employees and licensing it, enabling companies to conduct check-in options, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employee anonymity and complaint help lines, and, in some cases, direct supervisors.
The Redwood City start-up, which measures the employability of employees by software analytics companies, and its founder and chairman Jim Barnett, said, “There are now tools that monitor your health like Strava and Fitbit, but where is your company’s Fitbit?”
Errett says he better understand what his employees think and feel after three years using Glint.
In addition to offering skip-the-line surveys and optional surveys to specific teams, it offers a heat map showing which sections of the company received the most complaints and which director had a view of low-stakes scores; thus, the reasons for these can be overlooked.
Not to be the next Uber, companies are beginning to realize that they need to have knowledge about the culture of their workplaces; Uber has been in a scandal since it described an abusive environment in which people who say clearly what a former employee is thinking about in a blog post.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for supervision means a very lucrative business opportunity.
According to Let’s Talk Payments, the global management, regulatory and compliance industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020, according to financial technology insights website Let’s Talk Payments.
Interest and activity in Denver-based start-up Convercent, which helps companies detect and block bad behavior, has increased among Uber’s disapproval discussions earlier this year.
Convercent has close to 600 customers including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent also allows companies to make personalized “grandson” deletions, collect real-time secret answers, and extract heat maps of problematic areas.
It also offers a helpline that can send an anonymous message that employees can report bad behavior.
If the president is indicted, the complaints go directly to the board of directors.
Covercent’s founder and president, Patrick Quinlan, said: “The public court has taken over regulators.”
Quinlan said: “If a company behaves badly or does not behave ethically to its employees, regulators may face costly consequences due to consumer boycotts, employee bribery or lawsuits even if they don’t take effect.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to inform employees of the principles and procedures and offer easy access to the company center.
When an employee previously wanted to report a problem, he had to find a phone number or email from the company center, was in an official complaint, and was hoping it would be taken seriously.
Ruby Tuesday’s chief legal adviser, James Vitrano, said it was mostly an eye-opening and disturbing experience, not a good way to track employee complaints.
But with the company’s use of Convercent, problems previously hidden from managers sitting in the office, city, or state distances (such as segregation, harassment, or unfair payroll practices) can be identified and solved more quickly.
Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group, said: “I can approach this employment experience more holistically, from a 360-degree perspective.”
"We also protect our shareholders against business cases."
In 2002, following the collapse of the ethical values caused by the Enron scandal of accounting firm Arthur Andersen, companies took ethical, value, and employee relationship issues more seriously in 2002, Quinlan said.
But after "social media came to its own", the companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from being viral.
“Before technology was used to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
They offer both Glint and Convert software as a service and receive recurring fees for the use of their products.
This is a business model and opportunity endorsed by both start-up venture capital investors.
Convercent received $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital on Saturday and raised its total capital to $47 million.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and raised its total funding to $60 million.
Considering the nature, cultures and risk capitals of companies that are related to each other, these investments are not much of a surprise.
A growing amount of research shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than they used to.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the minimum requirements.
Employees want to feel that they are being accepted, valued, and given their time to a company with a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, LinkedIn’s global benefits and working experience vice president, using both Convercent and Glint, said: “When people are happy to be in a company, when they feel that their voices are heard, and when they are satisfied with the work they do, the company succeeds even more.”
Investors make a profit when their own portfolio companies do a good job; companies do a good job if they feel they belong to the company, and if the employees feel they belong to the company.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee integrity and sense of belonging, it’s not surprising that they find support.
It’s important to have data about employee loyalty, according to business culture experts.
But the data is useless if the company's managers don't act.
In fact, a company can create an expectation that change is coming if it wants feedback from its employees.
And if the expectation doesn't come fast enough or doesn't come at all, it can cause disappointment and make employees feel like they're broken.
Russell Raath, who is the head of consultancy at Kotter International and who has made the mistake of relying too much on the data collection of companies, said: “If you’re going to ask for 4000 recommendations, you need to be ready for 4000 talks.”
"Because if you don't follow, the employees will think, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you mind?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who makes monthly employee surveys, was able to take action the same day when a problem was reported at Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees who are tired of the decision-making mechanism and the speed of communication quality, he has been able to reorganize various teams within the company and added communication training to solve problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is taking new insights about its employees, and in the long run it hopes to become able to hold more workers in such a type of industry known to be a high number of employees.
Vitrona said, “If you don’t want to create a culture of transparency, you lose people.”
“And if you lose people, you’ll lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."
The NCAA’s lifting of two trainings every day means a long day for the Bruins.
It comes at 11 p.m. and they're hanging around to chat on one side of the new training ground on campus of a wrestling team consisting of UCLA football players.
Some are squeezing the tops of their forms, revealing their swirling backs from the hustle and bustle of the first day in the training camp.
For an important part of the team, these free minutes make up the mid-day break.
After 3 hours of training, players enrolled in summer classes will return to their home countries and work on their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6.30 a.m. the next morning.
Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before returning to Tuesday: “The next three days is a torment for these guys.”
Organized to lift the burden on players, the NCAA’s lifting of two workouts a day, at least until the finals on Friday, actually extended their days.
That's why UCLA's first three training sessions were scheduled to begin at 7.15 p.m. to accommodate players' already stuck schedule.
The reward for not having two workouts a day is more of a workout on days; Bruins is getting close to a week ahead of the camp's start last season, and is training at Mora's summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
In September, they plan to hold 18 training sessions until August 20, before they begin their official match preparations for their opening against Texas A&M.
Mora said the players added new pens to the intensive work programme, although he supported the NCAA's rule change.
Mora said, “We’re putting a huge load on them for three or four days, and that’s very demanding.”
“And they’ve been through this recently; they’re working, great kids.
I think we'll have more time when we get to Saturday, it's going to be really great."
UCLA will stop their workouts when the camp is over; it’s no easy task when it’s thought that the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which is held in the rain by the parking lot and the soccer ball next to it, is covered with a protective net behind the castle.
Bruins players are planning to settle in the hotel from the beginning of this week, but Mora admits that during the season these rooms may be a problem.
Mora said, "We'll have security."
"It's not too bad to think that it's a real worry and someone rents a room and sits there and pulls a workout video.
If a workout has a video recording, that’s a really good thing.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security at 8 up in the parking lot.
We'll do what we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan.”
Facebook Increases Story Verification Power for Fight Against Fake News
Facebook will send more potential fake articles to the third-party storytellers and show their findings under its original sharing, the world's largest online social network said Thursday it was trying to fight what it called fake news.
In a statement on the company’s website, he said they would use updated machine learning to detect potential frauds and send them to story verifiers and potentially show the story verification results under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the main distribution points of news, known to be fake news that many thought affected the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
In May, French voters had fake news ahead of the presidential election, and Germany was in the process of pursuing a major European policy in support of a plan to cut the penalty if they failed to quickly remove hate-filled posts on social media networks before the elections in September.
In a separate statement on Thursday, Facebook said a test of the new story verification feature was being launched in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Facebook News product manager Sara Su said in a blog post: “In addition to seeing what stories are discussed by third-party storytellers, people want more resources on what they read and share to make informed decisions.”
He added that Facebook will continue to test the “relevant article” feature and will work on other changes in the news stream to reduce fake news.
Creating a comic book: the story of a castle in England
In the recent past, Little Scotsney Castle was featured in a Squeeze music clip and became a shelter for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But now Scotney, inspired by a cartoon novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with a brush-haired, historical record, witnessed a 700-year-old history from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent.
"I find it very nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says politely.
"What a personal bond it is to hold this letter in my hand."
A Castle in England, from the Edwardian era to the Middle Ages, documents their families living in Scotland by a different artist named Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg, who made each story known as the United Kingdom.
This isn't Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he also wrote The Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories in 2014, a project he unexpectedly found inspirational from the stories at the British Library.
“I even filled my eyes with the fingerprints of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for King James’ supporters,” he says.
"This was a sign of his thumb!
And the letters always smell because then you burned a fire for light.
For someone in the next 300 years, this smell feels like he's there too.
I love the archives!”
As a former paper lover, getting support from the National Trust and the British Arts Council and being able to stay in a castle for almost four months (I seem a little overstayed, to be honest, by staying too warm to be welcomed).
Discovering the "new" castle of the Victorian period, Rhodes spent his days exploring the archives and working on many treasures and antiques, such as the backed heads and bottles that had been installed on the walls of the mansion, and the gates.
Talking to patrons, gardeners, and sometimes artists working on illustrations of his book, he toured the lands and remains of the old castle.
Then, at night, he would drink whiskey and write.
The full access to the National Trust is unknown in relation to Scotney's detailed history since the last heir Elizabeth Hussey died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff only began to take up the archive, which he describes as follows: “For centuries, aristocrats said, ‘Oh, throw it in the middle of the ceiling.’”
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps that set the boundaries of who owns what: "You think land disputes will be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a husky tree that the two families fought over.
“Excuse me, guys!”
Some of the stories in the collection, including The Labourer who left the newly built castle to join the Peasant Rebellion in 1381, use the castle as a jumping-off point to make a wider entry into British history.
“In this book, The Knights of Kent and Sussex, there is a record of the rebellion in the castle in 1380,” says Rhodes.
“The People’s Rebellion started around here and I thought a rebellion could be a good starting point.
“Maybe these two are related?”
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle, such as the story of the Darrell family, who hid a Jesuit priest for seven years during the British Reformation.
Or the Smuggler, where 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, thought to have filled a coffin with stones and laid his own funeral, is believed to have taken place (a revelation made years later when the coffin was removed from the ground).
The Darrells of Rhodes, the Scottish family, said: “These gentlemen seemed like a lot of regulars, they were always in debt, and they were spending money on things they couldn’t afford.
In different generations, Darrell solved the men’s debt crises by marrying rich old women; I imagine them as a group of handsome men who have the privilege of squeezing women’s heirs.”
Rhodes, who finished his mission at the castle, is looking for other unique writing experiences.
In Finn's wild life, he completed a two-week work for a comic book about El<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>ki, which has been the site of a sanatorium since the beginning of the 20th century.
But Scotney keeps a separate place in his heart.
"I'm sorry I broke up," he says.
“It’s like, ‘Oh, now I have to go and face the damn real life.’ ”
Meral Aksener's 'Maho' reaction
<0xC4><0xB0>smet B<0xC3><0xBC>y<0xC3><0xBC>kataman, Secretary General of the National Movement Party, recently made a written statement regarding social media and withdrawal claims in the press.
The mayor, using social media and the phrase "from the corners of some old guns" to the MHP, claimed that "the rebel movement was resorted to games and counters to prevent it from continuing its existence under the MHP roof after September 12."
Grandfather, he said:
"No matter how cynic, corrupt, criminal record that does not take away the historical existence of the Turkish people, it shakes hands if the mind is mixed."
They also said: “The management of MHP Kocaeli G<0xC3><0xB6>lc<0xC3><0xBC>k County and 410 of its members and 215 people resigned in the Yeni<0xC5><0x9F>ehir district of MHP Bursa.”
250 resignations are misdirected by the public with unsubstantiated unprofessional news, such as 300 resignations.
He lies in the columns of the newspaper, and he deepens the deception.
The number of representatives in the places mentioned above, as it is not a matter of a resignation that reaches our hands, does not exceed the fingers of a hand.
The mayor, who has been described as "in word" regarding the allegations, said that the public was again trying to misdirect and make sense management with the polls he referred to as "in word."
“The propaganda and campaigns that are about to create a perception of them against the MHP will be reversed,” he said.
MHP Secretary General B<0xC3><0xBC>y<0xC3><0xBC>kataman, who stated that MHP is an important and indispensable actor of Turkish politics, said:
The strength of the ancient Marxists is not enough to destroy the place that the MHP has acquired in the conscience of the Turkish people.
All comments made are behind a dirty account of the methods of perception management implemented.
Because politics and the media have set their sights on the MHP base.
Those who do not show any good work and effort for the benefit of our party, while among us, do not make any sense in our view that they are now resigning.
Who is the one who can't quit our party?
Their lives are not well touched by the MHP, they don’t share our memories, they don’t understand our countries, they don’t participate in our struggle, even if they’re always on the edge, they have to find other jobs.
The efforts of those who do not take the unity and integrity of the nationalist Movement Party, the pursuit of discussion, and the pursuit of suffrage, are an effort in beyhude.
And he will surely turn back and shoot his owner.
Despite heavy destruction, the nationalist movement is the last remaining stronghold of the Turkish people.
In his statement, Bigakataman, who said he targeted the MHP for the people he was targeting, said that "politicians", "political hijackers", "the nationalist movement is not without."
"No matter what the cost of the external migrants inside, who are fed beyond the ocean, they will not achieve their goals," he said.
Using the phrase "disgusting traitors will go mad and become ass in the nifty fire", the MHP's Grandfather, in his statement, ranking opposition parties and terrorist organizations together, found in the following claims: "From CHP to HDP; from there to the Perin<0xC3><0xA7>ekgille, PK"
Yesterday, we resisted the new tactics and games of those who planned without the MHP, Turkey without the MHP; the government without the MHP, fought until the end with the dishonorers who wanted the Parliament without the MHP.
Now we're gonna ruin the games, we're gonna spoil the players.
The Grand Master, who said "the patent of the peasantry is in the MHP", used the following expressions to imply that Meral Ak<0xC5><0x9F>ener was a beggar: "As in the film Banker Bilo, which is an old Green building, I will take the Maho peasants to Germany, and after spending days in the truck shed, I will tell you how
This is their issue, but the only desire of these constituents is to be new to the place where they are going.
Kjaer signed with Sevilla
Kjaer, who transferred 12.5 million Euros from the yellow-laced team to Sevilla at a cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12.5 million, has signed an official contract that dates back to the Spanish team as the most expensive defensive transfer.
The Danish star will wear the number 4 shape in Seville.
Great ease for baby families from THY
According to a press release from THY, the national airline, which keeps passengers’ flight comfort and satisfaction at the forefront and works to make them feel more comfortable during the flight, continues to develop new ideas for a perfect travel experience.
In this regard, the "baby travel kit", prepared by examining the needs of babies and their families between 0-2 years of age, began to be presented to baby passengers traveling on intercontinental flights from August.
The kit is made with a specially designed bag; the bottom changing cover, disposable breast liner, cat cream, baby lotion and shampoo, newborn wet cotton chin and chest pad is located.
Parabens, alcohol, non-toxic chemicals with paint, were produced taking into account the sensitivity of the baby's skin.
Washington is changing the Green Card rules.
According to the media, President Donald Trump said there would be a new U.S. immigration plan that changes the rules of the Green Card.
Legal immigrants expect to drop 50,000 allowances per year, stricter rules for temporary work permits, and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules were proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The draft law will be debated on both sides of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax havens, and it will do so by changing the way the U.S. gives green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current regime.
This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources they can afford, and who have the skills to benefit our economy," Trump said.
Authors commented on Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e-Sturm Graz match
For two seasons, Kad<0xC4><0xB1>k<0xC3><0xB6>y was once again caught up in the enthusiasm and performance that I couldn’t find.
A "mangal heart" team, which Aykut Kocaman had pulled out in his absences, was on the field to make a "stay behind us" deal with his side.
We can criticise your game, positions, or performances, but I haven’t seen a game that works and looks like this in a long time.
He made it clear in the first match but yesterday's apolles were on his own shoulder; Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e's field commander is now Valbuena.
While transferring, the age was a problem, but in Big Man's words there was an "indeed character" sentence.
Thirty years ago, we gave the name of the atomic ants to Riza <0xC3><0x87>almbay.
If he does, it will be the best comment for the French player.
He was everywhere in the field, joining all the grassroots organizations, always taking responsibility and also scoring a huge short-sighted performance.
Alper's leading role left the Sturm Graz team "limited" in the field for a long time.
The Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e constantly called for a formula to cross such a hard wall as he won the circuit without throwing the cornice.
They dominate the ball, but they don't produce effective passes in some kind of competitive penalty area.
This image may bring the comment "santrfor needed" but we're faced with a game that hesitates to pass Ahmethan, which can't put him in the position of the only centrfor in his hand.
Either the team didn't trust the young player or its performance needs to improve a bit more.
After the score was 1-1, they did not take advantage of two clear chances.
It was important to pass the tour, but it would make the night even more beautiful to raise this sider, who applauded the players' struggle.
There will probably be one or two new transfers by Monday.
But the truth is that Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e's biggest need is number 12...
We’re on the verge of a very bright and enjoyable season with this style of play that carries the heart of those who are trying to play in front.
Aykut Kocaman's machine dries the brush, he needs a little more time.
They are in good physical condition.
The quality of the game will also improve.
You can also clearly see that the confidence of all the players in the field has increased.
They need a lot of applause last night for a new page.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
While you may not be surprised at 2017, a new report is coming out on technological developments in the sex robot industry.
Yeah, yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
In recent years, the Responsible Robotics Institute (FRR) has published a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
We need to take their rise seriously, according to a retired professor in robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and the founder of the FRR, Noel Sharkey.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, the shape of the nipple and the type of nail.
Speaking about the release of the new report, Mr Sharkey said: “People laugh at them, but companies are actually a lot of people, and we’ll see them even more.”
Modern sex babies have evolved into robots with reactions, especially human-like, that are made by artificial intelligence, with silicone skin that is hot to touch from their inflatable counterparts.
Users can also customize their robots to match their own blood by selecting everything from eye color, breast tip shape and to nail type or color.
But since many robots have "personalities" enough to show a Stepford Woman to be innovative, this is becoming even more disturbing.
Modern sex babies evolved into silicon-powered robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows users to personalize their own robots according to the character characteristics they find attractive (e.g. attraction).
Then there are Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed characters that give the impression of attraction, including the character "Frijit Farrah" and the character "Va<0xC5><0x9F>i Wendy".
True Companion’s website says: “Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as responsive to your personality as possible.”
So what you love is what you love, what you don’t like, and so on.
They also have moods during the day, just like real people.
It can be sleepy, it can be willing to talk, or it can be “in full mode.”
There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots: not only do they take the place of real human relationships but the characteristics of a very obedient female personality that are the most thought-provoking of violent calls as they approach Frijit Farah.
On the website True Companion, Roxxxy resembles a vibrator but what happens to men.
“If a woman can be a vibrator (just like that) then why don’t men have Roxxxy too?” the website says.
What’s more, these sex robots are not just a fetish or sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat to the sex desire through neck rubbing, which is an optional addition to the ideal of gender equality.
Many men will not naturally have sex robots, and while the FRR is paying attention to their growing popularity, they are now part of the external chains of consumer culture.
But those who are out of the way can be highly instructive about the course of the period in which we live.
Many people are not strange or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be so.
It’s no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women’s rights are under threat around the world, as they are proud to be sexually assaulted by women in the White House.
The Handmaid’s Tale TV series’ most hairy horror side, not the depictions that show all the details, scientific bodies or carved eyes but how realistic the image feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but it does not feel like such a big change at the moment.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as much physical similarity as possible to real women (of course, in the ratio of porn stars) as possible.
They want their creators to feel human when they touch them and mimic the movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their “personalities,” robots clearly don’t represent real women.
They can't leave their wives, or they can't leave them.
There are no activities or past stories, there is nothing that will reveal their independence or destroy the fantasy of total slavery.
In other words, they are the slaves who enjoy it.
Or, as of 2017, caries.
U.S. military convoy attack: dead and wounded
In the suicide attack in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, foreign military forces operating in the country were targeted.
One NATO soldier and three civilians were also injured in the explosion, and five of the wounded were American soldiers in the convoy and one was a translator working with NATO forces.
In an official statement made by the NATO Support Forces in Afghanistan (Resolute Support), it was stated that NATO forces had infiltrated the suicide bomber's homemade explosive device during a joint patrol mission with the Afghan National Army.
The injured personnel were reportedly treated at Bagram Airport in the U.S. Military Hospital.
There is no danger to the lives of the injured.
The local press reports that the suicide bomber was a Taliban mansuspionage.
Trump's big deal?
Showing Mitt Romney as an Example of a Right
The division of families on a micro scale, polarizing U.S. voters, became the reality of the Trump era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the U.S. were filled with how to deal with the nightmare of relatives voting for Trump.
We're all trying to blow up our own filtering bubbles.
Less talk about it is the power to bring Trump’s families together.
I'm referring to this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and is broken between Republicans and our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
He reminded me that uniting against a common enemy could have a powerful effect.
Everyone who knows Trump, including his Republican brother, whom he has known for decades, is on the same side, all of a sudden and strangely.
It’s a good thing at the dinner table, of course; but it seems to me that in a broad context these important risks carry.
The left was revived by Trump, but the swirling effect of his presidency created the power to push right for all of us.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, one day we’re talking about the terrible possibility that his strange behaviors can no longer shock.
There’s even a more horrifying long-term scenario where Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who are against his own standards, and they suddenly seem to be a symbol of logic.
I find myself living nostalgic about Mitt Romney’s crazy version of insanity these days: the dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looks like), both of which are really very modest, according to Trump.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate needs to be in the head only to assess that the next Republican candidate provides immeasurable progress.
While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the Central Park horseback riding, the biggest and best three papers you could spend in the city if you don't need the horseback riding operated by the New York Parks Department.
Horses are hugely large, fiberglass designs in the central plains (all clowns making strange faces and animals turned to look scared behind their shoulders) and strangely whistling music.
In other words, many of the clichés of a city can be disappointing: the sights of tall buildings are starting to get boring, the horizon is getting so familiar that it can’t create too much excitement, and the reality of the city isn’t coming down.
It’s been thirty-five years and I still couldn’t quite get over the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage is actually a Swiss country house but not a Swiss country house (thematic bar Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counted as a Swiss Cottage) in Northern London.
What’s more, when you jump in Central Park, it’s still a strangely magical experience, so two-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and two-year-olds in their 40s can go here and all have a great time.
If I could give him a note, I would give him a full note, but thankfully no one asked.
On the other hand, this week I was asked to evaluate the “experience” of the transaction between 1 and 5 stars before passing my credit card on a bonmarche.
The same is true in the coffee shop on the corner of my street, and the option of matching a note with a 15% tip; for what is purchased from the counter...
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a side-by-side shopping, but also to put pressure on the server to get a person to an event that is never needed.
While the poor woman in Bonmar<0xC3><0xA7>e was screaming like standing up for forgiveness, I gave her five stars in the experience of giving her a credit card.
When the temperature reached 41 degrees, they wore mayo.
In Tunceli, where one of the hottest days of the season lived, the people streamed to the beaches of Munzur.
From noon, the young, children, elderly, women and men who entered the beaches on the banks of the Munzur River tried to protect themselves from the heat by cooling in waters such as ice.
In particular, Tuncelili citizens living in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France, and the United Kingdom, due to the fact that they spent their holidays in their homelands instead of the Aegean or the Mediterranean, filled the beaches on the banks of the Munzur River.
Suna Tosun, who is among the coolies on Munzur Beach, prefers to use Tunceli for the holidays instead of the western provinces, noting, "I didn't want to spend my vacation in the west, it was more right to cool down in Munzur family, to stay on our own land."
"There is no water like the ice of Munzur anywhere in the world, at these temperatures Munzur cools us," he said.
Hasan Ulu, from Germany, said they preferred the banks of the Munzur River in Tunceli instead of the <0xC3><0x87>e<0xC5><0x9F>me or Bodrum coasts, and therefore did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts in his wrists that he said occurred after he fell into the cell of prison officials.
Pistorius had been convicted of murder after a pre-accident decision by prosecutors to murder a man.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, he killed Steenkamp at his home in Pretoria by repeatedly shooting him at a bathroom door.
Pistorius had claimed to have confused his girlfriend with someone who had been in the cabin the night before.
Prosecutors said they intended to once again object to Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they thought was too light this time.
The National Retirement Mercii said it would appeal to the South African High Court, and the appeal could be assessed this year.
Pistorius, if the prosecutors succeed, will face a 15-year sentence.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The First Hajj Cavalry Has Been Successful
With the organization of the Presidency of Dianetics, the pilgrims to Saudi Arabia were successful in their prayers and tears at the Atat<0xC3><0xBC>rk International Airport.
Prior to the movement of the first Hajj Chapter, the ceremony at the Outer Lines Terminal was attended by citizens, as well as about 200 Hajj candidates as well as their loved ones.
On the other hand, the Turkish Airlines (THY) distributed roses to the pilgrims who went to the holy lands by charter plane.
The Hac chapel in Ankara was succeeded by Esanbo<0xC4><0x9F>a.
In Kafile, for the first time this year, there were also <0xC5><0xA0>ihit and <0xC5><0xBE>azi <0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC5><0xBE>i, who benefited from the application of "unlawful hajj for pilgrims and martyrs".
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Compelling Illegal Camp
According to a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and quoted by bTV, two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece on the grounds of illegal camping.
A group of two Bulgarians, including an illegal camper, were arrested by police on the morning of 1 August in Sithonia.
The investigation was stopped the same day as the investigation was still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed bTV that the Bulgarians were later abandoned.
The Greek authorities tightened their controls on free camping, and still imposes severe penalties on those caught while resting in undisclosed places for that purpose.
He'll be in control throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could cut the penalty.
We won't go back to Holland without finding him.
JOEY Hoffman, 22, went to Turkey to travel with two friends in early July.
Joey Hoffman, who was driving Adana and Mersin with the vehicle they rented, disappeared in Silifke on July 8.
His friends, who had come with him, reported the situation to his family in the Netherlands when they did not reach Hoffman despite all the calls.
While the police were moving to find the missing tourist, their brother Robin Hoffman and friends Angelo Durei went to Jaimy Gewald Adana.
ADDITIONAL BASTIRIP PARTY
Robin Hoffman, who is in police custody, has been sent to Adana and Mersin, pressing for his brother's whereabouts.
Robin Hoffman, who was last contacted by his brother on July 8, said: "We first applied to the police in the Netherlands."
Later, with two of my friends, we came to Turkey and went to the police.
We haven't received any news so far, and we haven't found a clue.
"We'll stay in Turkey until my brother finds us," he said.
Congratulations to Ay<0xC5><0x9F>e Ceren on the Second World Cup
Organized in Russia, the 2017 Palettli Swimming Youth World Championship was the world's second-highest water sportsman Ay<0xC5><0x9F>e Ceren Ye<0xC5><0x9F>ilba<0xC5><0x9F> at 400 metres.
Minister of Youth and Sport Osman A<0xC5><0x9F>k<0xC4><0xB1>n Bak congratulated Ay<0xC5><0x9F>e Ceren Ye<0xC5><0x9F>ilba<0xC5><0x9F>, who won the silver medal with the message he published.
On the first day of the 2017 Summer Youth World Championship held in Russia, Ceren Ye<0xC5><0x9F>ilba<0xC5><0x9F> became the world’s second-highest-water athlete.
Ceren took his place on the secondary bench with the amazing performance he showed on the track with 8 finalists, while he missed the gold medal with only 27 salices.
At 400 metres, Elena Lopatina won the gold medal with a score of 03.18.73 minutes from Russia, while Ceren won the silver medal with a score of 03.19.00.
Turkey is represented by eight men and eight women athletes in the championship.
His last words were “I think I’m dying, goodbye mom.”
Among those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire in London, it was declared to be 30, calling his mother in the instant of the fire, "I don't want to die, Mom, that's not fair at all."
"Thank you for everything you've done for me, goodbye," said Italian Gloria Trevisan and her boyfriend.
Among the dozens of unaccounted for after the fire, 26-year-old Gloria Trevisan and Italian lover Marco Gottardi, who were sitting on the 23rd floor of the 24-story building, were also present.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer for the Trevisan family living in northern Italy, said in a statement that the two young men had lost their lives, according to information from British authorities.
The lawyer, who said that the young people’s families are experiencing a great deal of pain, also asked journalists not to be pushers to get an explanation on the matter.
I think I'm dying, bye, Mom.
Lawyer Sandri said Gloria called her mother Emanuela Trevisan on the phone shortly after the fire broke out and that she was crying when she heard the last calls her mother recorded.
According to this, Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother several times over the next two hours after the fire, which started around 1am local time.
Trevisan, who was said to be calmer in his first talks, said, "Mom, bad things are happening here, fire has gone out."
We're stuck, we can't get out.
There's some smoke, but don't worry, we're waiting to be rescued.
“We tried to get out the door, but there was a lot of smoke and the elevator wasn’t working either,” he said.
The latest words of Gloria Trevisan, who is increasingly concerned about the growth of the fire, are as follows:
Mom, my whole life is going through my eyes.
I think I'm dying.
There was a life before me; it was not fair.
I don't want to die, and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I can't hug you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me, Mom.
I'm going to heaven now and I'm going to help you from there.
This is the fault of the Italian government.
Both Gloria Trevisan and her boyfriend Marco Gottardi, who were both trained in architecture, were forced to find a job after graduating last year, moving from the Veneto region in the north of the country to London in March.
Gloria Trevisan, who was able to find a job in her country with only 300 euros, had started working in London for a short period of time with a monthly salary of 1800 euros (about 2060 euros).
Lawyer Sandri said that Gloria Trevisan's family had spent difficult days financially, "Gloria had gone to London to help her family."
Unfortunately, our young people have to leave the country to save their future and find work.
“The government needs to find a solution to this problem immediately,” he said.
Italy’s drama that doesn’t give young people a job
Gloria’s father, Loris Trevisan, also expressed his anger, saying, “This is the fault of our government, which forces our young people to flee abroad to find work.”
In Italy, the unemployment rate reaches 12 per cent, while the youth rate is 40 per cent.
As this problem grew, over the past few years, many Italian youths had begun to immigrate to many European countries, including England at the beginning.
Last year alone, the number of young people who had to leave Italy due to unemployment exceeded 110 thousand.
Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi's comments on the confirmation of the news of death in the Italian press also indicated that this was the drama of a country that could not provide young people with a job.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can alleviate IBH
Red meat and chocolate can sound like nightmares for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the exact opposite: A diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of people suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This treatment, which affects 1.3 million people in the U.S. and 300,000 in the U.K., causes stomach cramps and swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and excessive fatigue.
Although patients are often advised to skip meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helped develop immune cells that develop a resilient gut.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna said that immune cells travel through the intestines so that the microbes hidden in the food do not sneak into the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced with cells that promote resistance by protecting sensitive tissues without harming them.
If the balance is too much towards inflammation, the inflammation can result from intestinal disease.
In experiments, it was found that a type of immune cell appeared in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines, which promotes resistance.
And the bacteria need tryptophan, one of the building blocks of the protein to trigger cells to emerge.
Professor Colonna said: “We have established a link between the development of the cell population, which is part of the gut microbiome, and the development of the bacterium type Lactobacillus reuteri, which promotes endurance.”
The mice with more tryptophan in their diets had more of these immune cells.”
If the same thing happens in humans, L. reuteri and tryptophan-rich diets could develop a more resilient, less inflammatory gut environment.
While postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas is working on a kind of immune cell that develops endurance, a group of experimental mice have these cells but do not have the same type of another group that is kept in a different place.
The difference was suspected to be related to mice's gut microbiomes, in other words, to bacterial, viral, and fungal communities that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice's guts were DNA sequenced, and six species of bacteria were found to exist in mice with immune cells, but none of them were found to be missing.
Since they were looked at in a sterile environment, L. reuteri was given to mice that lacked a gut microbiome and did not develop such a immune cell, and immune cells emerged.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers increased L. reuteri in fluid, and then transferred small amounts of this fluid, which is unbacterial to immature immune cells taken from mice.
Immunity cells have become cells that promote endurance.
The active ingredient was found to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3-lactic acid when it was extracted from the liquid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice’s diets, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that humans have cells that promote the same endurance as mice, and that most of us have L. reuteri in the gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop or develop in humans as in mice, but the disorders in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
He said: “The development of these cells is something we probably want to encourage because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, in cases where L. reuteri is present, high-level tryptophan causes this population to spread."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United has signed a 'dahiye' with Nemanja Matic
After the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening, Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has signed a "hide" with Nemanja Matic.
The <0xC2><0xA3>40 million transfer from Chelsea began with a 2-1 win in Dublin ahead of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday in United's previous match against Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira, who are looking forward to being in the forward position.
What’s more, Maviler had a severe lack of match-fixing condition that he left out on the Asian tour before the season and could only take 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted that it needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
Mourinho said, "He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, his way of thinking... he's thinking about football."
"We'll help him get ready sooner."
While Mourinho began to shape the first 11 for the start of the season, like Matic, new transfer friends Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also appeared at Aviva Stadium.
The Independent has revealed that Mourinho still wants three more transfers this week, but the club has already insisted that Mourinho is doing three of his top four transfers, making it "a remarkable job".
"Thank you to the club for taking the four of them," he added.
"If they get four out of four, I'd be happier, but they've spent a lot of effort on me."
Last year, 197 people were hospitalized.
According to data from the Swedish Social Welfare Agency, the gender dissatisfaction rate for one hundred thousand people in 2005 increased to eight hundred thousand in 2015.
Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, the majority of the children and young people who heard dissatisfaction with the gender she was born in last year, were airlifted.
The increase in the number of child psychiatrists in the same hospital, Lousise Frisen, could have been due to her becoming a more open society, adding, “It can also be seen as a general development in the open society in the psycho-sexual field, which also includes questions about sexual identity.”
Sexual dissatisfaction is known to have no connection to the sexual tendency of the disorder.
Drug Operation in <0xC4><0xB0>zmir

In a search at home, 33 ectacy pills were seized with a sensitive spleen.
F.T., who jumped from the balcony and tried to escape, was arrested and taken into custody.
After F.T.'s security operations, it was recorded that he would be sent to court.
Transfer to the new Malatyaspor
Evkur Nye Malatyaspor, one of the new teams of the Super League, joined the colours of winger Turgut Do<0xC4><0x9F>an <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, who wore the Kas<0xC4><0xB1>mpa<0xC5><0x9F>a form last season.
According to a statement from the yellow-and-white club, a two-year contract with the 29-year-old winger was signed within the scope of the transfer work.
"A two-year deal has been signed with winger Turgut Do<0xC4><0x9F>an <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, who is in Kas<0xC4><0xB1>mpa<0xC5><0x9F>a.
“Good for our new Malatyaspor,” the statement was used.
British inventor put on his own micro chip to get into his house and car with a hand gesture
A British inventor; he was the first person in the country to wear micro chips to open the front door, access the office, and even operate his car with only one hand gesture.
Steven Northam, 33, forced his finger between his small chip head and finger, and this service is now offering jobs and people who want to make their lives easier with technology through his company BioTeq.
To ensure that the implant procedure can be applied to medical standards, Winchester collaborated with Dr. Geoff Watson, an anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants.
The technology is similar to microchips being shipped to cats and dogs, and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company will also make changes to the locks in homes and vehicles, including <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock, so that the chip is compatible.
This technology has been incorporated into both the home of the man who is married and a father of a child and the BMW Z4, and the vehicle works while his hands are on the steering wheel.
White House Show Is Expensive for Thousands of Taxpayers
According to military records released to TIME, the White House’s decision to fly a marine infantry helicopter to the grasslands in the south for an organization that promoted American production last month cost taxpayers up to $24,000.
When the president met, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the focus of interest in the organization that introduced American construction programs on July 17 at the White House.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured products produced in all 50 states.
A helicopter made in Connecticut was shown alongside a yacht from Main, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of the helicopter operator Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1); the White House Harp Department, the helicopter’s presence with a neutral order (also called FRAGO) just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the southern grass for the organization.
The HMX-1's commander, a day before the organization, sent an e-mail to the Navy Air Command's chief executive, "I just wanted to make sure you're aware because this is an unusually high visibility organization."
The message indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the south shore at around 7 p.m. on July 17 for the organization at 3 p.m. and that the grass would remain there until it was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m.
Note that if the departure from the White House is delayed, the mission added that a second flight crew would be required for the return flight due to time constraints.
While the unit's security personnel were standing inside the air carrier, the original flight crew was on a helicopter during the organization.
It is not clear from the records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew is ultimately necessary.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
The records show that HMX-1 is investigating whether or not the organization violated this condition.
The commander wrote, "Our commander said that a question was whether or not he violated the Hatch Act and it was reported that he did not do it to us."
"It looks like you're outnumbered," replied the Deputy Commissioner.
The organization "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official organization and does not fall within the scope of the Hatch Act.
But even official organizations have political imams.
The president in the organization, then in the Senate, paid tribute to the efforts to reform health services and praised the efforts to curb government regulations.
Using aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents need to use it to travel.
But it’s not uncommon for these to be officially requested to be used for just one photo shoot opportunity.
Trump drew attention in February when the presidential plane advanced to the backstage of the first campaign meeting in Melbourne Florida, and when it was taken into account that the Twitter account's profile was filled with messages about the use of the presidential plane.
White House press assistant Lindsay Walters said: "The White House is excited by the 'Made in America' exhibition, where products made with American materials are made by workers from all 50 states."
The HMX-1 crew often conducts training flights in the Washington area, and exercises to leave the President of the United States on the southern lawn with a point shot at the White House.
Trump made 58 practice launches at the HMX-1 White House in Germany for the G-20 summit in early July.
An official said the flight, which was for the Made in America organization, was considered by the air crew to be in need of training that month.
Unit helicopters flew for an additional 11 hours that day for “support missions that have nothing to do with the presidency.”
The White House said tax payers were not charged for any other number in the organization.
A spokesman for Sikorksky said the companies did not participate in the arrangement to display the helicopter on the southern grasses.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and the exact cost incurred by the organization is difficult to detect.
But according to the Department of Defense’s hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the Department of Defense’s VH-3D rate is $24,340 per flight hour.
The unit records the flight time of the air carrier as 30 minutes from its central base in the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico Virginia.
The White House claims that the real operating cost of the helicopter is well below that.
“It’s very misleading to tax payers to make a deduction based on their estimates of the cost of living,” Walters said.
"These estimates cover the cost of the wreckage, which is included in personnel, maintenance and annual expenses."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Department of Defense’s cost-of-living rates do not include personnel expenses but include fuel, maintenance, and contract expenses.
At that time, former White House press spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for this organization.
Spicer said, "I'm here to show you what's going on in America this week."
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of their contributions to our national security, and I think hundreds of people, if not thousands, depend on it.
And like most Americans, I think we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans work tirelessly to make.
So, of course, it’s appropriate to highlight that.”
It's not clear whether or not Trump interacted with the helicopter while traveling the southern grass for the organization, but he stepped into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump called on representatives of Sikorsky, joking about the company’s products in his own fleet with the media.
"I know Sikorsky very well," he said, "I have three of them."

The third season of Narcos will be released for the first time on September 1.
According to B.M., Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women
The head of B.M.'s mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections could be representative if all sections of society, including women, play a role.
Nicholas Haysom, the president of the B.M. Assistance Mission, says that hundreds of women compete in county council elections, three women compete for presidential assistance, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
He said in a statement on Wednesday: "Women's role cannot be overstated."
Elections are only open to full participation by women, and if they are included in all parts of the election process, they can be truly representative and reliable.
The Afghan district council and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban have been under threat from the electoral process, which comes at a time when international military operations have become the advisory role.
This year’s election marks the peaceful revolution of power from one democratically elected government to another for the first time.
Haysom said the strong role of women would contribute to the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women from 3.6 million registered voters have registered.

McVitie's GMB worries about investment in Glasgow plant
A union wants assurances from the managers of cookie maker McVitie's that a long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow factory is being made.
GMB Scotland said the company remained silent about the future of its investment in the Tollcross region.
In addition to other products, more than 500 people work in the factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits are produced.
Pladis, owner of McVitie’s, said they have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the region over the past few years.
If there is a change in their operations, he added that employees and union representatives will be "first informed".
In a letter to the company's plant manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's to "resolve the concerns that production tapes are not providing funding for modernization."
Drew Duffy, GMB’s senior organizer, said: “The work needs of the general manager of the facility and the future of Tollcross are deeply concerned about our members not being able to see a difference in the investment plan for our members.
Families have been working here for generations and the workforce is concentrated in Glasgow and its suburbs, a critical base of sufficient employment in a field where there is local society and high unemployment.
“When it comes to work, wages and welfare, Brexit conditions, rising spending and chronic production cuts, need a four-headed manufacturing presence in Glasgow’s eastern end, McVitie’s,” he said.
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The head of the facility at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to our commitment to union representatives, which we have made to the workers.
We had a regular meeting at Tollcross with employees and GMB representatives two months ago, where several issues were clearly discussed.
Then we told our employees, like all the companies that work in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment, that we were constantly reviewing our operations for all of these jobs and facilities.
He added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in production tapes and operational developments.
We fully recognize Tollcross’s legacy as a manufacturing facility, and employees and their union representatives will be the first to know if there is any change in our operations at the facility.”
Necip and Utku in Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> for 4 more years
Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> Club extended the contract of Necip Uysal and Utku Yuvakuran for 4 years.
In the section on the website of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) containing data on footballers, it was seen that Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> extended the contract with two players until 31 May 2021.
Necip, who grew up in the infrastructure of the black-and-white team and made his first professional contract on 19 June 2008, began to wear A-team uniforms during the 2009–10 season.
The 1991 player, who rose to the team captainship, played a total of 254 official matches in the Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> format.
On the TFF website, Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> also received information that he had signed a contract with Utku Yuvakuran on May 31, 2021, taking over the bonus service, which he included in the squad as a rental last season.
The information that Utku was removed from temporary transfer status as of 1 August 2017 and that his license was renewed on 2 August 2017 can be found on the website.
Utku Yuvakuran served in matches in the 21-year-old Six League in Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>, where he was hired last season.
The young goalkeeper took on only 2 Turkish Cup matches in a black-and-white format.
PSG warned Barcelona about Neymar's departure three years ago?
La Liga side may have regretted his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won’t give up following Neymar after offering a bid to launch the <0xC2><0xA3>189 million exemption, but did they warn Barcelona of a world record three years ago?
With the Ligue 1 team ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the amount Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million, the sensational offer moved the summer transfer period.
With PSG offering a salary of <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week after taxes, the transfer shows that Neymar will be the world’s most expensive player and also the highest-earning professional athlete.
Although a source close to the Catalans' management insisted that the club always did its best to keep an eye on him since Santos' arrival in 2013, Barcelona is known to be angry about the style of the offer and Neymar's attempt to leave.
So, was the football world warned by the PSG president about this scene three years ago?
When he expressed his interest in signing Manchester City Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi made a stern warning to all clubs that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we're against them, and we're in contact with their players," he said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they get to sign one of our players, they’ll get the results.”
The Spanish club Barcelona this summer seems to have crossed this line by expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG has made it clear that it will not allow the Italian nation to leave under any conditions, and Barcelona feels good about losing Neymar by losing its reflections of this interest from its greatest values.

6 Europeans on Interpol's live bomb list
German newspaper Die Welt reported that Interpol (International Police Agency) in May sent a list of 173 people with the potential to stage suicide attacks on behalf of DEA<0xC5><0x9E> to security agencies in European countries.
132 people on the list were reported to be from Iraq, North Africa, the Gulf countries, Tajikistan and Bangladesh.
Six people on the list are said to be European citizens.
These people are said to have come from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Bosnia.
A DEA<0xC5><0x9E>-linked person from Germany was reported to be a 27-year-old German citizen from Solingen, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The man was said to have gone to Egypt first in the autumn of 2012, then to Turkey, and finally to Syria.
In a statement from the DEA<0xC5><0x9E>'s social media accounts in mid-July, it was recorded that this person died in Rakka.
The German Security Agency was informed that it did not answer questions about the issue of the newspaper.
The names on Interpol's list were further suggested to have been captured in operations conducted in Mosul towards DEA<0xC5><0x9E>.
According to Die Welt, American intelligence services have sent this list to Interpol by reviewing it.
It was also noted that Interpol forwarded the list to police agencies in Europe in May.
According to Die Welt, ISIS may be attempting to send some of the names on this list to Europe for the purpose of arranging suicide attacks, based on the German security environment.
Soldier's success horror with pumped gun: 5-year-old star may lose eye
There was a bloodbath in the youth's success in the army.
A crowd gathered in the park in Karadolap Mahallesi to congratulate their friends who were going to the army the night before.
It is alleged that the M.K. and the U.A. bombarded the group from time to time opened fire on the air.
After the success of the band, the band began to break up.
M.K. shot a hand on the floor with a pumped gun as he passed by the playground full of children.
One of the children sitting in the park bank because of the noise from the ground was injured by five people.
It was also reflected in the park's security cameras.
The wounded were taken to the surrounding hospitals with Ferhat Turan, Ercan Turan, Kader Balk<0xC4><0xB1>r, Star Unus, and Ingri Stone ambulances.
Five-year-old Star Unus, who was being treated at the hospital, was at risk of losing his left eye.
The star's grandmother, Maryam Kaya, told DHA at the time.
Rock, who said the incident happened while his grandson was on his lap, "The military celebration began at 8 p.m."
It took two hours.
The military fun is over.
The young people began to disperse.
When it's over, we'll get up.
At that moment, the gun exploded, right in front of me.
My grandson's not well.
You may lose between 80 and 90 percent of your eyesight.
We talked to the doctor, he said.
