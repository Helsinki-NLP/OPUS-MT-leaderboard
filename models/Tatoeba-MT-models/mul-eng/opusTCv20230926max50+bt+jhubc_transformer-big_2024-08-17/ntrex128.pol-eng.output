Members of the Welsh National Assembly are afraid that they will be called muppets
Among some members of the National Assembly, there has been consternation. This is the effect of the proposal to change their title to the Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
The idea was born out of plans to change the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the subject of m<0xC4><0xAB>n.
One of the Labour MPs expressed fears about his group, saying the new name is rife with the Welsh words “twp” and “pwp”.
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, the word “twp” means stupid, and the word “pwp” means “departure”.
One of the politicians of the Plaid Cymru party said his group was "unsatisfied" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party is "open" to change the name, but he noted that the word "MWP" is very close to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the letter "u" in the English Yorkshire dialect.
As part of the meeting, the committee that is currently working on the draft law amending the name took the following position: “Of course, the final decision on the future title of the members of the meeting will be their own”.
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposal, and the transformation of the Assembly into the Welsh Parliament gained broad support.
In addition, the Commission supported the proposal to change the title of members of the Assembly to "Member of the Welsh Parliament", i.e. WMP in English, although this abbreviation "MWP" enjoyed the greatest popularity among the public.
Members of the Assembly propose alternative solutions. Difficulties in reaching a consensus are a stumbling block for Elin Jones, the chairman of the Assembly, who is expected to present the draft law in the coming weeks.
The law introducing reforms will also take into account other changes in the way the Assembly works, including the principles of the withdrawal of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title when discussing the law.
Macedonian people vote in referendum on changing the name of the country
In the coming Sunday, voters will decide whether their country will soon bear the name of the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote is intended to help avert a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a region called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long argued that the name of their northern neighbor is a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
<0xC7><0xB4>orge Ivanov, President of Macedonia and opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he was ignoring the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the plebiscite, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that the change is necessary to enable the country to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's Church in New York are ringing due to the problems of the churches in Harlem
“The older people I’m talking to say that once in every corner there was a bar and a church,” said Michael Henry Adams.
“There’s no trace of them now.”
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“Today, people give themselves to society in a different way,” he said.
“Bars have ceased to be a place of regular meetings of members of the community.”
In the case of churches, on the other hand, he is concerned that the funds coming from the sale of the property are not enough for as long as the decision-makers think, and that “ sooner or later they will be at the point of departure”.
He added that churches could be replaced by apartments inhabited by people who would not support the rest of the surrounding temples.
As he said: “The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in such buildings will be the white race. This will accelerate the total closure of churches, because it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by a gathering of white believers even before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the church of St. Marcin joined the community a decade later).
The original gathering of white Methodists left the area in the 1930s.
The surrounding congregation of African-Americans then took over ownership of the building.
The Church of St. Marcin was taken over by a congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against sellers from 125th Street (the main shopping street in Harlem), opposing the employment or promotion of African Americans.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild the temple and ordered the construction of a bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of John Howard Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the new carillon "the two poor."
The expert, who broke into the bells in July, described them in a different way, as “cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first carillon in the world operated by a black musician. The artist was Dionysio A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to Riverside Church, where he was waiting for a larger team.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said that the church of St. Marcin did not replace him.
In recent months, a number of complicated events have taken place in the church of St. Marcin with the participation of architects and performers, some of whom have been brought to the scene by the secular leaders of the church, and some — the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (the governing body of the parish composed of secular leaders) addressed its concerns to the diocese, claiming that "it wants to transfer costs to the council", although the council did not take part in the hiring of architects and performers.
Some parishioners also complain of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Rekin injured 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California
Authorities reported that last Saturday the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California. The incident occurred on the first day of the season for lobsters.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning, for about half an hour, he was diving with friends when he heard a call for help. Immediately, a group of friends rushed to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first it seemed to him that the boy was excited by the seizure of the lobster. However, he soon realized that the child was screaming: “I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
Upon reaching the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had completely torn skin in the vicinity of the obi<0xC4><0x87>i<0xC4><0x87>.
“I started yelling at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to a children's hospital at the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego, where his condition was described as critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During a press conference, the rescuer Captain Larry Giles said that the fish had already been spotted a few weeks earlier, but it was recognized that it does not belong to the species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper part of the torso.
In order to investigate and for security reasons, authorities closed the entrance to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours.
Larry Giles noted that the area is home to more than 135 species of sharks, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to expand its operations in the UK cosmetic market.
The Sainsbury’s network throws a glove at stores such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing to its supermarkets cosmetic departments that refer to the style of department stores, as well as specially trained vendors.
As part of a significant investment in the British cosmetic market – which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and is constantly developing despite declines in the fashion industry and household items – in 11 stores belonging to the network will appear larger shelves with cosmetic products.
The return to the cosmetic industry stems from the search for ways to manage the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household articles.
According to Sainsbury's, the network will double the number of cosmetic products and will offer up to 3 thousand items. In the assortment will appear for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw.
Currently sold L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands will also receive more space and separate areas close to those known at least from Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to refresh its offer of products for make-up Boutique. From now on, most articles will be friendly to vegans, which is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second will be in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The prevalence of online sales and daily purchases of small amounts of food in local stores makes supermarkets more likely to encourage customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury’s, said that sales outlets will increasingly resemble department stores because the network is trying to fight off discounts like Aldi or Lidl, offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos network points in hundreds of stores and has introduced a number of Habitat network points since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increased sales of food items and increased investment profitability.
The previous attempt to reorganize the departments with cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals ended in a failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company with Boots, but the collaboration was terminated as a result of a dispute over the distribution of revenues from pharmacies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury’s is introducing a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will contribute to the plan, according to reports, by introducing an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four online stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Director of Commercial Affairs, said: “We have transformed the look and character of cosmetics departments to improve customer impressions.
We have invested in special trainings for employees so that they can help consumers when shopping.
Our brands are able to meet all needs, and the friendly environment and convenient locations allow us to attract the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the current ways of making purchases.”
Peter Jones ‘wrong’ after retiring Holly Willoughby from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den, was “angry” when he learned that Holly Willoughby was about to retire from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle brand to focus on a new-found collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby doesn’t have time for their brand offering household accessories and articles under the name Truly.
The activity was repeatedly compared to the Goop brand belonging to Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, a 37-year-old presenter announced her departure via Instagram.
The sudden decision to leave the well-promised lifestyle brand and focus on a newly established collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV, made by Holly Willoughby, angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den.
According to sources, Peter Jones was “angry” when a popular TV presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that due to new contracts worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, the company will not have enough time to spend on them.
The company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, which was also expected to double Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
After announcing the decision to leave the Truly brand by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby on Instagram, Peter Jones left the UK, going to one of his summer homes.
According to the source, “The Truly brand was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She tied her future with it and wanted to deal with it for decades to come.
The decision to withdraw from the business was a surprise to all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was already so close to entering the market.
In the Marlow warehouse, the goods are ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the resignation of the presenter of the program This Morning and one of the most successful stars in the UK can cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in products – including articles from pillows by candles to candles and candles, as well as clothes.
It can also mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin have maintained a close relationship with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby, along with Tara Capp, founded the Truly brand in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them in March as president.
The pair spent the holidays together, and Jones covered 40% of the shares in the television production company owned by Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is set to become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business matters.”
Difficult conversation, "and then we fell in love"
The president joked about the criticism of the media caused by the remark, which some considered to be “unsatisfactory to the husband of the state,” as well as a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a grinning voice, giving the TV presenter:
“I didn’t give anything.”
The President drew attention to the fact that Kim Jong Un is interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was called by Trump a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament, however, have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomacy chief Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see an “analogous response” from the United States early on.
He noted that instead, the United States is supporting sanctions and exerting pressure.
President Trump has expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un had had a positive effect: they led to the completion of missile tests, helped to free the hostages and bring the rest of the U.S. troops home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach while discussing relations with Kim Jong Un.
“It’s easy to behave after the president, but instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to the crowded stadium, we’d have 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing fingers at the crowd gathered right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have successfully destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of the roof over the head by more than 10% of the population of Lombok, the authorities did not declare a food disaster, which is a necessary condition for accelerating international aid actions.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they do not require international support, so the situation is difficult,” said Selina Sumbang.
While Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not yet clear whether international staff will be able to operate at the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the national food disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Pal to see if aid from international organizations should be allowed.
In the face of the constant shocks felt in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh province, they are a rarity for the rest of the coastline.
The absence of a warning siren to the tsunami in Pal – despite issuing a warning – was likely to have had an impact on the number of fatalities.
Even in the most favorable conditions, travelling between the Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Food shortages are making logistics even more difficult to deal with.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on the island of Lombok, is heading with help for the victims of the earthquake to the city of Palu. However, reaching the destination will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure the main point of his campaign and allocated a lot of funds on the roads and railways.
However, in the face of next year’s elections, the president’s administration is struggling with a lack of funds.
In addition, Joko Widodo was under pressure because of the ongoing religious tensions in the country. Members of the majority of the Muslim community adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands of residents lost their roofs over their heads as a result of fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, arches, guns and other simple weapons on the streets.
Liverpool footballer Daniel Sturridge wins a draw goal in Chelsea's match
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the English Premier League, winning the goal in the 89th minute of Saturday's game played at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters from Chelsea gate at a 1:0 loss to his team.
Before the shot was fired in the direction of the remote gate, he turned the ball to his left leg.
The ball was hovering high above the penalty field in the direction of the upper right corner of the net.
Then she entered the gate, hovering over Kep Arrizabalaga, who threw himself at her.
“I just tried to take the position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri are always trying to move it as far as possible. I wanted to give myself the best shot,” Sturridge said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
“I noticed Kant approaching, I took the ball and gave the shot without any further thought.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the middle of the match after the goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard shot in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker kicked the ball in the fifth to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> and then ran towards half Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly accepted the offer in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful play forward in the penalty area back to Hazard.
Hazard ahead of the defenders and left footed in the direction of a long column of shots that passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has increased to 832 people
Indonesia’s food disaster agency said Sunday that the number of victims of the recent earthquake and tsunami in the country has increased to 832 people.
During the conference, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported that, as a result of a Friday earthquake of 7.5 degrees in the Richter scale, many people were trapped under rubble. In addition, the quake caused a tsunami wave of 6 meters high.
The town of Palu, inhabited by more than 380,000 people, is full of rubble of collapsed buildings.

Cromwell memorial in front of British Parliament last victim in dispute over “writing history again”
The removal of the monument would bring justice for the actions of the Taliban to destroy many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical, Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Given the ongoing debate on the removal of monuments, the dispute over Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of the Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
Imagery operations during the English Civil War were neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps for the actions of his ancestor Thomas a century earlier it was decided not to punish this Cromwell.
The manner in which Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell at the monument testifies to the opinion of this politician in the 19th century and to the fact that for many people he is a figure that is still worth remembering.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith said: “For many Cromwell was seen – perhaps more often in the 19th century than today – as a defender of parliament from external pressures, in this case of course it was a monarchy.
The assessment of the extent to which this statement is relevant is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one of the sides of division.
His achievements as a lord of protectors also deserve to be celebrated and remembered.”
In China, a pig farmer’s death has been reported.
According to local media, there was a deadly pig attack on a farmer at a trade fair in the south-west of China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bleeding and with a severed artery near a bakery in the city of Liupanshui, in the province of Kuejczou.
The pig farmer is preparing to carry out vaccinations at the mill, May 30, 2005, in Xining City, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, the man came to the fair with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the cousin found a man’s body and noticed an open door to the nearby bread.
He said that in the bread there was a large request with blood on the rye.
The body section confirmed that it was a nearly 250-kilogram pig that had fatally disturbed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeding and bruised,” said a man named Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The footage from the surveillance camera shows that Yuan arrived at the fair on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The store manager said in an interview with Guiyang Evening News that at the time of the collection of evidence by the police, the request was isolated to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the family of the man and the trade authorities are negotiating compensation for the death.
Cases of pig attacks on humans have already been reported before, although they are a rarity.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts. The man was fatally wounded.
Ten years earlier, in Wales, nearly 300-kilograms of pigs drove a farmer into a tractor. The husband’s wife managed to pull the animal away.
After eating a pig farmer from Oregon in 2012, one of the farmers in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can unleash brutal behavior in them.
“They just want to have fun.
They're as touching as children... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them the right respect," he said.
Remnants after Hurricane Rosa cause intense rainfall in the southwestern part of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is losing power, moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days it will cause intense rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa was given a category 1 on Sunday at 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time, which was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico at that time.
According to the forecast on Sunday, Rosa will move north.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean begins to form rather than heading east on the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the Peninsula of California in the form of a tropical storm, moving the mass of the wetlands to the west of the United States.
On Monday, it will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in parts of Mexico.
In the coming days, humid tropical air coming into contact with the approaching low will cause heavy rainfall in the Southwest of the United States.
In some places, rainfalls ranging from 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden floods, displacement of pollution and possible landslides in desert areas.
Wet tropical air will cause anywhere from 5 to 7.5 cm of precipitation per hour, especially in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is predicted in some areas of the U.S. Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Due to the widespread nature of tropical rainfall, sudden flooding and sudden changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, it is definitely advisable to move on foot in the desert terrain.
Extensive spills can turn canyons into rippling rivers, and thunderstorms can cause local winds and dust to move.
Next up, it will bring abundant local rainfall on the southern coast of California.
Rain with a total height of more than 1.3 cm is possible, which can cause small movements of pollution and danger on the roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
Passing tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona on late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoons and Tuesdays rain will occur in a greater number of areas.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will reach the Four Corners region in the western part of the United States and will last until Wednesday.
In October, along with the cooling in the Arctic region throughout the United States, temperature fluctuations may occur. However, in the intervertebrate zone there will be rather heat.
This can lead to sudden changes in temperature at short distances.
A good example is the Sunday temperature differences in the central part of the states.
Between Kansas City (state Missouri) and Omaha (state Nebraska) and between St. Louis (state Missouri) and Des Moines (state Iowa) these differences are almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, the prevailing summer temperatures may rise again.
In much of the central and eastern United States it is expected to be warm in early October. Temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to the northern part of the East.
On Tuesday in New York City, the temperature can reach a value of up to 27 degrees Celsius, which is about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability of over-temperatures occurring in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s interview
More than 20 million people watched in six television stations moving Thursday’s hearing of a candidate for Supreme Court Justice Bretta Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman accusing a sexual molestation lawyer in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political impasse on Friday, commentators had to interrupt regularly given programs to inform about the sudden return: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100% sure that Kavanaugh was covering her up in a state of sobriety and was trying to take off her clothes during a high school event.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said, however, that he is convinced that such a situation did not take place.
It is possible that the number of TVs on Friday was even higher than that provided by Nielsen 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of television stations CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, numerical data was not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring viewership among people in the workplace.
The number is close to the viewership of the American football cup games or the award ceremony of the American Film Academy.
According to Nielsen reports, the Fox News Channel station, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, had the highest viewership. It averaged 5.69 million viewers during a full-day interview.
In the second place was the ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the subject remained high after the end of the hearing.
Jeff Flake has become a key figure in Friday’s events.
In the morning, he was arrested by the cameras of CNN and CBS after the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. On the recording, he shouts at protesters, who made it difficult for him to enter the elevator on the way to the committee hearing.
Flake, with his head down for a few minutes, was listening to unsatisfactory opinions, and the whole event was broadcast by CNN.
“I stand here before you and ask.
Do you think he's telling people the truth?
You have the strength in the face of so many women’s disabilities,” he heard from a woman demonstrating.
Prior to closing the door of the elevator, Jeff Flake said his office had issued an appropriate statement and that he would speak during a commission hearing.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast the events in anticipation of a vote on the passing of Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate.
Flake said he would support the nomination only if he knew the FBI would investigate the charges in the coming week, which was urged by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced after part of a conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made the decision after a meeting with Chris Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice was important because the Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without an investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges brought against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit for her own benefit
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing the future of the UK and undermining the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May attends a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May, the former foreign minister in her government, Boris Johnson, attacked a plan for future relations with the European Union following Brexit, saying the UK and the EU would not be able to collect tariffs on their behalf.
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Murdering LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in the colors of the University of Louisiana (LSU).
Police at Baton Rouge, 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson, have reportedly been arrested and placed in custody on charges of second-degree murder.
The authorities have released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police have reported that during the battle Sims lost his glasses.
According to a CBS-linked WAFB station, police officers found the glasses on the scene and found traces of Simpson's DNA.
The police informed after Simpson's interrogation that he had confessed to shooting Wayde.
As the lawyer told the detainee, the amount of the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge coroner’s office released an initial report saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police command expressed its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police Search Group, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and nearby residents for their help in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s director of sports, thanked local law enforcement for “workability and the pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge when his father, Wayne Sims, also played basketball at LSU.
In his last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“It’s one of those things that we’re constantly afraid of,” said Will Wade.
The ash emitted by the volcano reaches Mexico City
The ash from the volcano Popocatépetl has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for the Prevention of Food Disasters (NDC) warned Mexicans to approach the volcano due to the increase in activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over a 24-hour period.
The center has recorded numerous snoring and shocks.
The images posted on social media show the front windows of cars covered with a thin layer of ash in Mexico’s neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Since the 7.1-degree earthquake that struck Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity located 72 km southeast of the country’s capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Start of police with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona as a result of the efforts of demonstrators supporting Catalonia’s independence with preventive police units. On that day thousands of people took part in the demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the impending cataclysm.
A group of masked supporters of the separation threw eggs and powder paint on police officers. Dark clouds of dust swept the streets usually full of tourists.
An attempt was also made later in the day. In order to stop the fighting, the police force used a cannon.
For a few hours, the independence-supporting group chanted "We will not forget, we will not forgive". Opponents of the secession shouted "Let Spain live".
According to the local press, 14 people received medical assistance in connection with minor injuries sustained during the protests.
After a year since the referendum on October 1, the tension is not weak. Although the authorities in Madrid considered it illegal, it is still a reason to celebrate for the Catalan secessionists.
The majority of the voters spoke out for independence, but the frequency was low due to the wide-ranging boycott of the opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year in brutal clashes with police trying to prevent voting in polling stations.
On Friday evening, a group of people supporting the region’s independence decided to prevent a demonstration of supporting police officers.
The demonstration took place despite this, however, the route was forced to change.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who is taking part in a separatist protest with his wife, said there was no longer any hope for Catalonia's independence.
“Last year, we experienced one of the most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents were crying with joy that they could vote, but now we’re stuck in a point with no way out,” he said.
Despite the significant but small victory in the local elections in December last year, the parties supporting the secession of Catalonia have difficulty in continuing their activities. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or are not expected to leave in detention in detention in the process
Joan Puig, a forty-two-year-old mechanic recording a telephone protest in support of the police, said politicians on both sides of the dispute were fueling the conflict.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year, announced his intention to start in next year’s European Parliament elections.
“Candidacy in the elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis of democratic values of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after getting into a car at home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested following a multiple-run car crash at a Londonderry home.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. British Time (BST).
Detective Superintendent Bob Blemmings said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At some point in the direction of the car could also be given a shot from the barrel.
Mengi Gate secures Livingston victory over Rangers 1:0
Dolly Mengi's first goal for Livingston brought the team victory
Ever since that season, the Livingston club has made the Rangers go crazy, giving Steven Gerrard his second defeat in his 18 games as the club's head coach at Ibrox Park.
Dolly Mengi's goal proved to be a victory, and Gary Holt's team moved to second place in the table with Hibernian.
The team led by Gerrard remains undefeated this season at the start of the Premiership. Next Sunday, the team will face the leader of Hearts, to which they will lose eight points.
Earlier, because already on Thursday, Rangers will be hosting the Rapid Vienna team as part of the UEFA Europa League matches.
Livingston has extended the winning streak in his six-match division to six, with coach Holt failing to replace Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed a few chances against his undefeated opponents.
The team led by Holt should have taken the lead much earlier, as the team's game has caused Rangers a lot of problems.
At first Scott Robinson broke through the defence and gave the shot to the light of the gate, but failed to shoot the goal, then Alan Lithgow did not hit after taking over Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the goal, knowing that they could threaten rivals during the game's constant fragments.
And that's how the decisive gate fell.
After the Rangers' free kick, the Livingston team found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created a situation for Mendza, who scored a goal from the middle of the penalty field.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, but they were unable to fortify the hosts' defenses and did not cause major problems to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Alfredo Morelos gave one shot at Kelly's goal in the second half.
Scott Pittman's attempt was defended by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was unable to get into the light of the gate from another permanent fragment destined for Livingston.
The Rangers continued to attack Livingston's penalty area, but were unable to take advantage of the situation. They demanded two penalty kicks after Halkett's intervention against Glenn Middleton and one game by hand. In both cases, however, the players' claims were dismissed.
Livingston’s “Fenomenal” Performance – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
He thought they played great, once again going beyond expectations.
Their style and composition have hardly changed since returning to extraclasses. However, you should appreciate Holta for motivating the team to play.
This game had a lot of heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a well-organized defense, while Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall have to be very careful throughout the game.
Rangers didn't want to fight.
While under the leadership of Gerrard, they have great moments, they have not maintained their standards in the match.
There seemed to be something missing in their game: only once managed to break through the host's defense. It should be a serious warning for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
During a Saturday breakfast in Berlin (September 29th) the leaders of Turkey and Germany were accompanied by smiles and beautiful weather.
It was the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of improving relations between NATO allies.
The differences in issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the European Union led to disputes.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
This city has the largest number of Turks living outside of its homeland.
According to police, for security reasons, a 25-thousand crowd gathered in front of the temple was blocked. However, supporters of the president gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents – including many Kurds – also decided to express their opinion, condemning the policies of the Turkish leader and the German government’s decision to adopt policies in the country.
The protests against each other are a reflection of the divisions that sparked the visit of the politician, shouted by some Turks living in Germany, and considered by others to be autocratic.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car
The cyclist was killed in a car crash in London when he was killed.
The accident occurred near the crowded intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, a southeastern part of the city, around 10:15 a.m. British Time (BST).
After the incident, the driver stopped the vehicle, and medical rescuers arrived at the scene. Despite the intervention, the man died at the scene of the accident.
A few months ago, on Childers Street (a mile and a half from the site of the Saturday accident) another fatal accident occurred with the participation of a cyclist. The wrecker then escaped from the site of the accident.
Metropolitan police said officials were working to identify the man who had died and to inform the family members of the incident.
Roads were closed and bus tours were organised, and drivers were advised to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officials suffered injuries as a result of the clashes
According to the site’s authorities, six officials suffered injuries as a result of a mix-up at a penal facility for men with an elevated level of security.
Settlements at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire began on Sunday around 9:30 a.m. British Time (BST) and are still ongoing.
For the riots involving eight prisoners in one of the wings of the facility was called the specialized unit "Tornado".
Officials who were on the scene suffered minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the plant said: “Specially trained personnel were involved in the action at HMP Long Lartin.
Six of the officers suffered minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our facilities. We are confident that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time in prison.”
The HMP Long Lartin prison is home to more than 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports in June, the director of the facility had to go to the hospital after he was attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, prevention units were called to the plant due to the dangerous mix-ups, in which workers were attacked by bullets to play billiards.
The sudden flooding caused by Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial effects on drought-affected areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to reach the state of Arizona. It is likely to happen at the beginning of next week. Remnants after Hurricane Rosa move through the desert areas of the Southwest, creating a threat of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the possibility of sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including in cities such as Las Vegas, Las Vegas, and Las Vegas, Las Vegas, and Las Vegas.
According to the forecast on Tuesday, it will be direct over Phoenix. On Monday afternoon we will start rain showers.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported via Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of storms or tropical depression within 320 km of Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached a distance of 65 km from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict rainfall of 5 to 10 cm. In some areas of Mogollon Rim in Arizona, they can reach up to 15 cm.
In the rest of the desert areas of the South West – including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin – the height of precipitation is likely to be from 2.5 to 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
People outside areas threatened by the sudden floods accompanying Hurricane Rosa can bring relief, as the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
Although flooding poses a serious threat, some of the rainfall will improve the situation in the South West, where the state of drought prevails.
According to the weather.com portal, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40% of the Arizona area is struggling with droughts that fall into the second of the highest categories.
Hurricane Rosa will arrive first on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move with hurricane force, reaching speeds of up to 137 km/h. It is currently 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and heading north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane encounters the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, which causes it to weaken.
According to the forecast, it will hit Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall in some parts of Mexico can pose a major flood threat.
Weather.com reported that “in the area from the California Peninsula to the north-west of the state of Sonora, rainfall is expected from 7 to 15 cm tall, although they can reach 25 cm.”
Then Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico in the northern direction in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early hours of the morning, it will reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression. By Tuesday evening it will enter the southern part of the state of Utah.
“The most serious threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is the very abundant rainfall in the California Peninsula, in the northwestern part of the state of Sonora, and in the southwestern areas of the desert of the United States of America.”
According to rain forecasts, life-threatening floods and displacements of pollution in the desert and muddy avalanches in the mountainous terrain will result.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested in connection with attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempting to murder a 16-year-old found with blunt wounds in Somerset County.
The boy was found at Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, around 4:00 a.m. British Time (BST).

Police from Avon and Somerset said one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials are asking for contact with all persons with recordings of the event.
Trump Says Brett Kavanaugh “felt outrage and outrage” from the Democratic Party
“The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is the voice against the reckless and outrageous conduct of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “felt outrage and outrage” from the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before Congress. He strongly and emotionally denied the charges of Christina Blasey Ford. The woman claims that a few decades ago, when they were both teenagers, a man admitted to sexual assault in relation to her.
Ford also testified during an investigation into the allegations she made against him.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, “the Americans could see the brilliance, the class, and the courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of support for one of the most prominent lawyers of our time, a law scholar of great merit for the community,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president did not directly refer to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of the frequency of Republicans in the half of the presidential election.
“Of the most important elections in our lives, we’ve been divided into five weeks.
I don’t start in these elections, but I remain very active,” he said.
“I’m still fighting to defend our great candidates.”
Trump says Democrats are pursuing a policy of “resistance and impeding activity.”
According to CNN, one of the assistants of the Republican Party’s important policy, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia. The number of victims is increasing
According to authorities, at least 384 people were killed on Saturday — many of whom were abducted by high waves breaking through the beaches — as a result of a severe earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday in Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in a festival in the city. On the way to the coast, waves reaching up to 6 meters high, kidnapping many people and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When the threat emerged yesterday, the people who were on the beach did not immediately escape and fell victim to the tsunami,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPD food disaster agency, told a conference in Jakarta.
“Tsunami attacked everything on its way, hijacking cars, logs and houses,” Nugroho said, adding that before reaching the shoreline, the animal was moving at a speed of 800 km/h.
As he said, some of them were saved by climbing trees and managed to survive.
Some 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Pal.
In the aerial photos published by the Agency for Animal Disasters, you can see many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was hit by secondary shocks.
In the area of 2.4 million people, there were a series of earthquakes.
According to a statement by the Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Utilization (BPPT), the energy released by the extensive Friday earthquake was about two hundred times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement said that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have affected the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been hit.
He then added that the bodies of some of the victims were found under collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 people are considered missing.
Nugroho said the fatalities and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Pal, in an area called Donggal, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to Nugro, the communication was "completely paralyzed", so there are no reports from the province of Donggal.
"More than 300,000 people live there" — you can read in the statement of the Red Cross. It was also added that the employees and volunteers of the organization go to places affected by the disaster.
“We can already talk about the tragedy, although the situation may be much worse,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency met with widespread criticism due to the lack of information about the tsunami hit in Pal, but authorities said the waves came just after the warning was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man screaming out of the building, trying to warn about the tsunami coming from people on the street.
Within a few minutes, the water wall broke down on the shore, robbing buildings and cars.
The Reuters agency was not able to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant power shortages, preventing communication within the Palu region, which in turn made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to authorities, the army began sending transport aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still very much need food and other basic items of first need.
The airport located in the city is open exclusively for humanitarian transport. The airport will remain inactive until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Pal.
More than 800 tsunami victims in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As reported by Doseb T. Sinai, the national director of World Vision, the organization’s personnel arrived safely from the province of Donggal to the city of Palu and found shelter in the empty tents set up on the courtyard of the office. Along the way, the workers passed many devastated areas.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although some groups are slowly beginning to carry aid, there have been voices of criticism that foreign workers of humanitarian organizations with rich experience are being prevented from travelling to Pal.
According to Indonesian law, the adoption of funding, resources and personnel from abroad can begin only after the announcement of the place of disaster to the area of national disaster.
This has not been done so far.
“Officially, we are still dealing with a regional disaster,” said a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government recognises that there has been a national disaster, we will be able to start accepting international aid, but that has not happened yet.”
Two days after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Pal, friends and families of missing persons continue to live up to the hope that their loved ones will find themselves in the midst of destruction by some miracle.
A small boy was pulled out of the canals on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who spent two days under the rubble next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian paratroopers’ national team, trained two missing paratroopers who took part in the finals of the Asian Games this month in Indonesia.
As Petra Mandagi said, other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his disciples.
“As an experienced paratrooper, I am struggling with my own emotional weight,” he said.
Gendon Subandano said that within hours of the arrival of the community of paratroopers, Roa Roa desperately sent messages by a WhatsApp communicator to athletes participating in the beach festival.
His messages were marked with only one gray hooker instead of a pair of blue hookers.
“It seems to me that means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thief Steals $26,750 While Complementing Cash in ATM at Newport on the Levee Mall
According to a Newport Police Command statement on Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who had replenished cash in a cash machine at a Newport on the Levee shopping center.
“The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to supplement the cash,” Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
Another man "runs from behind to Brink's employee" and steals a bag of cash for the ATM.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the theft.
All persons with information on the identity of the thief are requested to contact the Newport Police Command at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
Announcing his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote of himself: “A person formerly known as Kanye West.”
Forty-one-year-old musician has been using the pseudonym Ye for some time. It is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change occurred before a visit to Saturday Night Live. It is expected that during the performance the artist will present his new album titled Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande in the program, who, according to the creators, gave up her participation for “emotional reasons”.
West has previously stated that the word "Ye" is not only short of its current artistic merit, but has religious significance.
“It seems to me that ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Holy Scriptures it means ‘You’,” West said earlier in the year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter named Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s about us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – a reflection of all of our good, bad and spoiled qualities.
The album shows who we are.”
West was among other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, announced this year that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West co-worker, also wrote down his pseudonym in various ways, with a connector, without a connector, and with big letters.
President of Mexico Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador pledges not to use the military against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody suppression of student demonstrations, the President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador (AMLO), pledged never to use the military against civilians.
On Saturday, in the Square of the Three Cultures, L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised “never to use the army to repress the Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on the square in the direction of a peaceful demonstration, killing up to 300 people. The event occurred at a time when left-wing student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised to support young people in Mexico, providing monthly financial assistance to students, as well as creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for young people's education towards criminal groups.
The U.S. Should Double Funding for Artificial Intelligence Research
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence expert working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, as well as China’s growing activity in this area, the United States should double spending on research in the field of SI.
The attention paid is related to the announcements on artificial intelligence published by various U.S. government agencies, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an official strategy on AI.
Meanwhile, last year, China presented its plan, according to which it wants to become the most innovative state in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“First of all, we need to double the budget for research on SI: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview with CNBC this week, he also said that doubling the funds could double the chance of another breakthrough in the area of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the chairman of the company’s board of directors.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create the SI system, which defeated the best American player at the time in the game Othello. He then held a managerial position in Microsoft Research and was president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognized the success of the previous technological initiatives of the U.S. government, e.g. organized by the Advanced Defense Research Projects Agency (DARPA) competition for the most interesting robot projects. He also turned to the question of the date of the next edition of the battle,
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get government subsidies.
“It’s not China that gets us the best representatives of academic environments, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
For several years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have been hiring outstanding scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States in the development of SI.
“I believe that people who are engaged in artificial intelligence, who have obtained a Ph.D. degree, should automatically be awarded a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create artificial intelligence for the next generation.
As Lee noted, the Chinese National Science Foundation (National Natural Science Foundation of China) provides funding to members of academic institutions in a manner close to the American National Science Foundation and other government organizations awarding funds to American academics. The quality of the activities of the Chinese academics is not the same.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will engage in the work of partners from the world of industry and science. The White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA also announced a $2 billion grant for an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation is currently investing more than $100 billion a year in research on SI.
At the same time, the U.S. initiative aimed at creating a national commission on artificial intelligence security has not stepped forward for months.
Macedonian voters vote in a referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would allow them to avoid a decades-long dispute with Greece, which is blocking the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, on the territory of the historic country of Macedonia, maintains that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, thus prohibiting the country's accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached an agreement on naming; however, the nationalists argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority living in Macedonia.
President <0xC7><0xB4>orge Ivanov said he would not take part in the vote. The campaign encouraging the boycott raised doubts as to whether the frequency would reach the minimum level of 50% required to consider the referendum as binding.
The referendum asked the following question: “Do you support joining NATO and the EU as a result of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, say it is worth paying a price for the possibility of joining Macedonia – one of the countries formed after the collapse of Yugoslavia – to organizations such as the European Union or NATO.
“I have voted for the future of my country so that the young people of Macedonia can live free under the umbrella of the European Union. Membership in the EU will give us all greater security,” said 79-year-old Olivier Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they respect the results of the vote.
The name change requires the support of two-thirds of the members of parliament.
The State Electoral Commission informed that no unusual events had been reported until 13 o’clock.
However, the frequency of this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections of 2016. At that time, 66% of eligible people voted.
“I voted for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said <0xC7><0xB4>osze Tanewski, 62, a voter from Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in the Macedonian city of Strumica, Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum to change the country's name to open the way to NATO and European Union membership.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small scene and set the chairs in front of tents spread by people boycotting the referendum.
“We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organizations with a united head, not a back door,” Kawardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China or Russia and become part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaew says NATO membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will advocate a change of name in the referendum, because 80% of the citizens support the European Union and NATO,” Zaew said after the vote.
He said the vote on “yes” was a “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Public Research, between 30 and 43% of voters declared their desire to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required frequency.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV, Telma TV in a Sunday referendum plans to vote 57% of the respondents.
70% of respondents said it would support a change of name.
In order for the vote to end successfully, the frequency must be 50% + 1 vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City beats Brighton's entire defense and wins the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent home the defense of Brighton in Saturday's 2-0 draw for Manchester City. The match was played at Etihad Stadium in Manchester (England).
The goal scored by Aguera in 65 minutes looked easy on the child.
The action began with the surrender of the Argentinian assailant in the middle of the battlefield.
The player has beaten Brighton's three defenders.
Aguero was one of Brighton's four players.
First he played one of them, and then he chased the others and found himself at the edge of Brighton's penal field.
He then played the ball to the left, where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English striker immediately handed the ball back to Aguera in the penalty area, which defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by shooting the right side of the goal.
“Aguero is fighting a foot injury,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky to have won the game at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who provided the blue first lead in a single in the Premier League.
The gate we're talking about fell in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero received the ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent a great message along the left side of the field to Leroy Sane.
Sane made several moves, allowing Sterling to move to a distant pole.
Manchester City striker pointed the ball to the net just before she hit the car.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. The meeting will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to ruin the chances of winning the Rockies
After losing the chance to participate in the play-off phase by the Washington Nationals Scherzer did not have to appear in the first composition.
However, Scherzer's fan-favorite rivalry is hoping to perform in Sunday's meeting against the Colorado Rockies, if only the Rockies maintain a chance of performing in the play-off phase. Currently, the team has one more win than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
The Rockies can count on at least a wild card if they win Friday's game against the Nationals with a score of 5:2. However, they still want to get their first division champion title.
“Even though we’re playing ‘nothing’, at least we’ll go on the pitch knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the opponent’s performance will be at the highest level as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn’t I want to take part in this meeting?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starter for Sunday's meeting, but the team is gearing up for Scherzer's first-team exhibition.
It would be Scherzer's thirty-fourth performance in the first composition. The player took part in Thursday's throw training and is hoping to perform on Sunday.
Washington's right-handed batsman scored 18-7 and the ERA 2.53. 300-times eliminated the bowlers and scored 220 and 2/3 rounds per season.
Trump's Day in West Virginia
Trump did not directly refer to his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge, discussing the importance of the frequency of Republicans in half of the presidential election.
“In November, we are putting all our achievements so far on the line.
One of the most important choices in our lives is the five weeks that divide us.
Although I don’t start, I remain very active. I constantly defend our great candidates,” he said.
Then he continued: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions in our own eyes.
They're determined to take power by all means possible, they're mean and evil.
They do not care about who they hurt and who they must harm in order to gain power and control. Taking power and control is their goal. We do not give them that.
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out a mission “to resist and hinder activity.”
“It has been very good to see this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “bad, evil, unpleasant and untrue.”
The president referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling on the name and name of the U.S. Senator from the Democratic Party Dianne Feinstein, who met with loud applause from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the document?
“Uh, am I listening?
No... I mean... no." Her body language was fatal. It was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When the activists of Momentum in my party voted for granting me a ban, I was not surprised.
At the end of the day, I am a member of a group of Labour members who were recently told that they are not welcome, and all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, met with a similar treatment because she was opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the request for the award of the award was the result of a difference of opinion between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. Ironically, Jeremy Corbyn was opposed to the position of previous leaders in these matters.
In a Friday announcement of the Labour Party’s meeting of parliamentarians from Nottingham East, one could read: “We want the meetings to be open and productive.”
During my eight years in office as a member of the Labour Party, most of the Friday afternoon meetings of the General Committee looked like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are now taking place differently: they have long forgotten about the promise of a “heartier and milder” policy, if ever remembered.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party. Each opinion is assessed in terms of compliance with the leadership of the party.
It all started soon after the position of President of the EU Jeremy Corbyn. Colleges, in which it seemed to me that we had similar views, began to expect from me a change of direction and to take positions with which they had not previously agreed.
After every public appearance – regardless of the content – I meet on social media with attacks calling for nominations, the condemnation of centrism or the abandonment of the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the attentions directed at me are rather political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience daily treatment in a sexist or racist way, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the transition to the agenda with the insult of others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a grouping of people with different views. With every request for a “vote of distrust” and every change in the rules of the choice of the worldview of the party, it is condensed.
Over the past two years, I have been repeatedly suggested not to sneeze and silence certain issues. Then everything “would be fine”.
But that’s not why I’ve been involved in politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the neglects of the government of Margaret Thatcher, which led to the collapse of my school class, I have tried to take care of better public services for people in need – both as a local councilor and as a minister.
I never hid my convictions, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East knew my position and knew about the differences of opinion with the party authorities.
To those who supported Friday’s proposal, I would like to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste my time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the Labour President in the face of the approaching Brexit, which will harm the households and the public.
However, the most important message I send is not to all of Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud that I can serve you. I promise that no threats of withdrawal of nominations or immediate political goals will pass on to you.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17 – undefeated Ayr back on the mountain
Two late deployments could have somewhat missed the final result. However, there is no doubt that the Ayr team deserved to win in this extremely interesting Scottish extraliga match.
The team placed first in the table and remains the only undefeated team.
In the end, this distinguished defense and better use of the opportunity led the host team to victory. Coach Peter Murchie could be pleased with his subordinates.
"So far the matches have been a challenge for us, but we are still undefeated, so I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose team said: “We have to pay respect to Ayr’s players. They’ve made better use of the opportunities that come up from us.”
Ayr went on to lead in the 14th minute after Grant Anderson and Frazier Clima's promotion. However, the yellow card for Rory Hughes's scotch, who came to the team from the Glasgow Warriors team, allowed Melrose to equalize the lead with the batsman's javelin.
Climo increased Ayr's lead after kicking off the penalty kick just before the end of the first half. First he won the bet, and later he took the chance to raise, obtaining a 17:5 score for Ayr.
Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's upscaling by Baggot reduced the loss to five points.
Then there was a longer stoppage of the game due to a serious injury to Ruaridha Knott. The player was removed from the field on his nose. After the recovery, Ayr increased the lead after Stafford McDowall was deployed and the rise of the climate.
Ayr Blair Macpherson, the captain of the Ayr team, was given a yellow card. Melrose again used his number: applying with an unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the lead.
The hosts took over the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for dropping the Clima without the ball. MacPherson won an application on the back of the approaching defense.
Climo took advantage of the chance to raise, and then again he managed to raise the score immediately after the game resumed, when Kyle Rowe caught a shot from a penalty kick and allowed Gregor Henry's wingman to get a fifth bet for the host.
The star of the Still Game series starts a career in the food industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, seems to be starting a business in the food industry. It was recently discovered that he became the director of the restaurant management company.
The 56-year-old actor stars as Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular sitcom, and co-creats the series with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duet announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the history of the series. Everything indicates that Ford Kiernan is already planning the future after leaving Craiglang.
According to official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although the Scottish Sun informant suggested that Kiernan is trying to engage in the “developing gastronomic industry” in Glasgow.
“The sea belongs to us”: the lack of access to the sea Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
The Marines patrol the area of the naval base in La Paz.
There are blue flags from public buildings.
In the ports of the navy from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto reads: “The sea is ours by law.
It is our duty to restore it.”
In no access to the sea of Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody 19th century resource conflict is still alive, quite like a dream of a re-ship across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the greatest in decades. Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice. It is due to be issued on 1 October after a five-year trial.
“The actions of Bolivia are gaining momentum. The inhabitants are unanimous, optimistic and count on a favorable verdict,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will jointly attend the meeting of the International Court of Justice. They hope that the organization based in The Hague will recognize the claim of Bolivia and after decades of fruitless talks Chile will not have to enter the country to negotiate.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who next year will face an awakening controversy in the fight for re-election, also puts hope in Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts argue that the chances of a favorable decision for Bolivia are small and that even a favorable decision would not change much.
The United Nations body based in The Hague has no authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. He also noted that it will not affect the establishment of any talks.
As Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law, said, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the presentation of the final arguments. Such a short time shows that the case “was not complicated”.
In the past four years, Bolivia has been able to move the country away from the goal.
“The issue of access to the sea has been addressed by the current Bolivian administration,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate.
Morales’ irreplaceable rhetoric deprived the Chileans of any remnant of goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult in the face of the situation.
In the case of both of these countries, there has been no exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, former president and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed with the opinion that the court’s decision-making process was extremely rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring “a unique opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end the 139-year period of disputes with reference to mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the subject of access to the sea as part of a political game.
“Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The verdict is a great opportunity to make sure that we have to deal with the past.”
North Korea’s leaders say that nuclear disarmament will not happen until they can trust the United States to do so.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his people will never get rid of nuclear weapons until they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two countries.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is as if the absence of sanctions and US opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War has ever thrown North Korea on its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to the signing of the declaration without Pjongjang taking specific disarmament steps.
Both Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is seriously going to liquidate an arsenal that is perceived in North Korea as the only security-enhancing measure.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for the second summit of Kim-Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows announce the appearance of the latest line of big head coverings in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your collection of hats or completely shade from the sun, then we have good information for you.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy, oversized head coverings made up of their summer 2019 collection, which shone in style during the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats were uploaded on Instagram this summer. The aforementioned designers decided to present their stunning creations on the run.
The distinctive work of Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide, feathery round watering the head of models.
Other oversized accessories included arbuses decorated with gems, a magician’s hat, and even pineapple — however, they were not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of different masks — at the same time on Halloween.
Many colored masks had their mouth sewn and resembled more Hannibal Lecter's style than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled scuba gear with pipe and goggles, and the other looked like melted ice.
And if you don't want to break up with big fashion, you're in luck.
Observers of styles predict that huge hats can be found in clothing stores.
The inexhaustible hats follow just behind "La Bomba", a broken hat with a 61 cm wide round that everyone has worn - from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this extremely impractical hat, which has been passed through social media, presented another great creation on the run — a straw beach bag almost as big as the model wearing it in a swimsuit.
A brand-new orange raffia bag, finished with raffia friezes and finished with a white leather handle, stood out in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the summer season 2019 during the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a star designer, told FEMAIL: “I hope that large hats and beach bags will appear in stores next summer — because the designer has managed to make such a big impact, it would be hard not to use them.
John Edward: The Language Skills Needed for the World’s Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their scientific achievements — in 2018 they were able to boast the following excellent results of exams, individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other endeavors.
Represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) schools, attended by more than 30,000 students across Scotland, they aim to provide the best level of services to students and parents.
The aim of the independent schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career paths and to indicate their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that has the opportunity to develop and implement a curriculum tailored to the needs of the school, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to another man in a language he understands, then it’s up to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that the languages occupy the first place in league rankings, with the highest rates of susceptibility occurring in the case of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages received a higher A rating.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students received a higher A rating in Mandarin, and 72 per cent of German learners, 69 per cent of French learners and 63 per cent of Spanish learners also received an A rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the necessary skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, language learning, as subjects to choose from, is conducted in the same scope as STEM subjects (narrow science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) within the framework of teaching programs in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) found that, due to the difficulty in occupying vacant jobs by employers, 17 percent of the candidates’ language skills were inadequate.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for the start of a career in the field of linguistics.
These skills are necessary in a globalized world with an increasing number of jobs requiring language skills, and
The ability to stay alive, like learning a second language, will have a huge advantage in the future — regardless of the defensive path of professional development.
The possibility of direct communication with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person in relation to the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults, 75% of them were unable to speak in a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by 1 percent of the population.
Therefore, investing in the teaching of foreign languages is so important for today’s children.
The knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will give children a greater chance of finding the appropriate employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages taught in it.
Many schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered to be most important for the UK in the 2020s, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interest of the child, in independent schools there will always be many languages to choose from, which will be taught by specialized didactic staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are involved in creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary to succeed—regardless of what the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that in an international business environment, languages still play a key role in the future of the country, and so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as ‘international communication skills’. . . .
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a great choice, diversity and level of choice.
That's just right.
John Edward, Chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron made his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans who want to see LeBron James’ debut in the Los Angeles Lakers have finally arrived.
Luke Walton, the Lakers coach, announced that LeBron James would play in a Sunday pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
“More than one, but less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers team reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play a few minutes short.
After training, which took place earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need to take part in pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
So Trump's election in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election evenings in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
It’s the first of five Trump’s planned election nights to be held next week, along with positions in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Along with a vote confirming the suspension of his election to fill a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to build up support in the upcoming elections to a handful of governments, as Republicans may risk losing control of Congress when the ballots are cast.
What time will Trump’s election in West Virginia take place tonight, and where will he be able to watch it online?
So Trump’s election in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held today at 7 p.m., i.e. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
So Trump’s election in West Virginia will be live-streamed via the Internet on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s hearings of a candidate nominated to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has been held in a tense atmosphere in connection with allegations of misconduct on the sexual background, as well as the alleged misconduct in the case.
However, the main objective of this series of electoral evenings is to provide support to Republicans facing difficult November elections.
So President Trump’s five-decade campaign next week is aimed at “mobilizing volunteers and supporters to provide assistance to Republicans in protecting and expanding the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives” — Reuters.
“Congress control is such an important point in the president’s schedule that as the hottest season of the campaign approaches, he will visit as many states as possible,” said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who did not give his name.
Today's Wesbanco Arena rally in Wheeling may attract fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media attention from Pittsburgh" — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia — a state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points — for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in the polls.
“This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows the spirit of the fight, keeping hope of victory in Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format that took place on Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging speed swing is a completely invented sports concept, but one that the players really believe in, and most importantly, in such competitions as these.
So what does their speed look like at this point?
"They've driven six points, and now they're only running four, so I think we've got a little gap," Spieth said.
Europe, of course, leads by four points, while there are still twelve to win.
The Americans, Spieth says, however, feel the wind in the sails and have decent patterns to follow, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each of them could boast of winning three points out of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
Screams across the entire throat as a sign of excitement became more and more loud during his rounds, dripping the key putt and winning the match when he and Thomas won two pits in two strokes.
His reflection on the ground, which gave them victory with a score of 15, met with a similar cry — one that makes it clear that the American team is still in play.
“It’s enough to focus and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
18 holes to win.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but beautiful pair of European teams won four of the four and did not go wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't count on a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on Friday morning.
The way the game is played and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the noisy crowd proves that you have to beat these players on Sunday, as well as that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could score a potential Euro-League victory.
It would be best if they were playing on different dolls at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he was swept away with Alex Noren.
Bogey and the double-doubles on the front nine dug Spain and Sweden into a hole they would never get out of.
There's no one on Sunday who can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how a change of strategy can happen at one time.
Europe has played better as a team so far and had a significant advantage on the last day, but the foursome session also showed that the U.S. team has a cut to the fight that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe with a score of 10-6 includes leading in the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 Saturday fourball and foursome matches with the United States.
The inspired duet — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — conceded a draw, bringing two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods, increasing his previous Le Golf National score to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to maintain the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the underdog American team in the morning fourball format, winning the series 3-1.
The United States put up more resistance in the form of a foursome, winning two games, but could not make up for the loss.
To keep the trophy, the team of Jim Furyk must score eight points from 12 singles, which will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while along with Molinari (this team was named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend) are just the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four matches.
After Wood's and Patrick Reed's four-ball breakup, they beat out pumped-out Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau, achieving an even more empathetic 5&4 result.
Woods, who was tired of two Saturday games, occasionally showed a glitches of genius, but has so far lost 19 of 29 matches in fourball and foursome formats, and that’s seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in the foursome format to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who ranked 1st and 3rd respectively in the world rankings.
For the European team, however, not everything went according to the idea of this pleasant, cold day on the field set out to the south-west of Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a point of reference for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4&3 in foursome, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has it happened that the team made a four-point loss, starting a single, although Furyk's team would only have a draw to keep the trophy.
However, taking second place two days ago, Sunday’s contract seems to be less likely.
North Korea says it is "permanently not" one-sided disarmament without trust.
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday during a speech at the United Nations that the lack of lifting sanctions only deepens North Korea’s lack of confidence in the United States and there is no point in unilaterally giving up nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and a commitment to non-proliferation and non-proliferation.
“But we don’t see any concrete response from the US,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security and under such circumstances there will be no unilateral disarmament of North Korea.”
While Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s unwillingness to take a “stage” approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded for its gradual action, one of his statements turned out to be untrue.
Ri referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between the incumbent U.S. president and the leader of North Korea, which took place on June 12 in Singapore, when it was Kim Jong Un’s turn to say goodbye.
North Korea expected the formal end of the Korean War (1950–1953), but the U.S. delegation announced that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also relied on calls to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea, the report said.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization in the first place’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, even opposing the signing of the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The experience that sanctions can put us on our knees is the hatred of people who behave towards us in an ignorant way.
The problem, however, is that the lack of sanctions is deepening our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which he spoke about earlier this week at the UN forum.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, after which he added: “If the South Korean leader was not a South Korean, he would have been a South Korean leader.
In addition, the tone of Ri’s speech was completely different compared to the previous year, when he said at the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles in the territory of the United States is inevitable after the “Mr. Trump’s” “Mr. Trump’s” “Mr. Evil President” (Mr. Trump’s “Mr. Trump’s”
This year at the UN forum, Trump, who threatened last year’s “total destruction” of North Korea, praised North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but also said that he still needed to put in a lot of work, and that he would not say that he would do much, he said.
Trump said on Wednesday that he did not designate a timeframe for it, saying, “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, said on Thursday at the UN Security Council forum that “the implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be continued and continued until we find full, final and verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea, trying to ease funding for Pyongyang's nuclear program and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly forum and later said he would return to Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, after which North Korea condemned him for "putting in gangster demands" within hours.
North Korea has pledged this month at a meeting with Moon Jae-in that it will dismantle the missile testing site and nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said that Kim Jong Un told him that the “appropriate measures” he cares about are security guarantees that Trump has committed to ensuring in Singapore, and taking steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking part in a course on the appropriate long-term rest.
The new course at Harvard University, which took place this year, provided all students with more sleep, which was intended to combat the growing macho culture, which consisted of being taught by “night-time caffeine-fueled students.”
Academic students from the best university in the world often have no idea of the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
To create the course, he was inspired to make a speech about the influence of sleep deprivation on learning.
“After the end of the speech, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why is this being told to me only now that I’m in my final year of studies?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the meaning of the dream, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
During the course, which took place for the first time this year, it is explained to students how good sleep-related habits help achieve good results in science and sports, as well as improve the overall well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Service, said the course was set to be introduced after it was found that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of the room in the academy, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, exercises and books to get information about the impact of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects sports outcomes, as well as how important it is to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
In another section, participants learn how a long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their day-to-day routine.
“We know that this will not cause an immediate change in student behavior.
But we believe that they have the right to know — just as everyone has the right to know what health effects smoking cigarettes has with them,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride from “all-night science” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means an increasing problem of lack of sleep.
Ensuring a sufficient amount of good quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even allowing them to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go through a state of mind.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop a course after taking part in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press for the introduction of the course for the entire campus.
The next step, according to him, is to invite all undergraduate students to complete a similar degree program before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a reminder alarm when to go to sleep and when to get up, as well as to be aware of the harmful effect of the “blue light” emitted by the screens of electronic devices and to fix the LED lighting problem, which can solve the problem.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes over Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered again during the fight on their way out in Livingston, when Dolly Menga with his shot led to the defeat of the dismounted Steven Gerrard team, achieving a 1-0 result.
The team at Ibrox Stadium wanted to record their first win from the 4–1 victory over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 games, causing his team to score eight points — the Premier League leader
Menga scored a goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers' lack of commitment did not appear to be improving.
While the Rangers recorded a fall to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third — just behind the Hibernian with the loss of a single goal.
The Rangers team may have further trouble due to the need to care for the head injury of the linear judge Calum Spence after he was hit by an object thrown from a guest stand.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, allowing Ayr to advance to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, in turn, went with the same 11-year-old Livingston, who took the Hearts team spot last week, being impressed by the way his well-trained team struggled at every step of their opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but the Livingston team did more with the ball when they got it.
They were supposed to score in just two minutes, when Menga's first exposure of the ball allowed Scott Pittman to face Allan McGregor's goal, but the assistant didn't take his chances.
Then Keaghan Jacobs addressed a deep free throw to Captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow playing in the defensive position could only remain in the rear position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quarter, but it looked like they had more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly recognized that he had been sentenced to fifteen minutes before the end of the game, when he and Steven Lawless fell on him, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claim.
The Rangers were able to deliver only two first-half shots, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was barely worried about the head of Lassana Coulibaly and the weak shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livingston's 34-minute goal opening game may have been against the passing of the game, no one can deny that they deserved him for the effort put in to win it.
Again, the Rangers couldn't cope with a deep, permanent fragment of the game made by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball at Scott Robinson, who kept quiet by giving it to Menga in order to simply finish the action.
Gerrard did not hesitate in the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent — this shift almost immediately had an effect on the winger who threw the ball at Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it from his position.
The Livingston team continued to draw visitors to the game exactly as they liked when Lithgow and Halkett performed long servings one after the other.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the last minutes, but McGregor made a good bet against Jacobs, after which Lithgow distanced the game from the corner.
The Rangers' reserve Glenn Middleton once again had hope of a penalty shootout when he clashed with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes again.
Almanac: inventor of Geiger counter
And now the page from our edition "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882 — 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become both an element of science and pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", which featured seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's wrong with the corpse?"
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you’ll hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactive minerals.”
Evans: “Now you hear something!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention, which bears his name, has survived to this day.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the enemy cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the enemy’s cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize enemy cells as part of treatment.
This method consists in extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them into a laboratory.
Then they can "see" the protein common to many cancers. Then they are injected back into the body.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancers.
In one woman who was treated with a vaccine, the immune system was able to recognize enemy cells, and ovarian cancer was observed for more than 18 months.
The method is to separate immune cells from the patient, change them to the laboratory, so that they can “see” the protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject the patient with these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that this vaccine is very well tolerated.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several types of cancers,” including breast, ovary, lung and colon cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and “teaching” their localization of cancer cells worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West goes on a pro-Trump show on Saturday Night Live — with a MAGA hat on his head.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was “exploded” in the studio during Saturday Night Live after praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would apply for office in 2020.
After performing his third song that night titled Ghost Town, during which he had an established hat with the inscription "Make America Great", he held a speech against the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
“Every time I talk to white people, I hear, ‘How do you like Trump? He’s a racist!’
If I were interested in racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony filed before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault charges filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Despite the fact that it was not broadcast, West's footage was sent to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known if Rock wanted to make West laugh by posting a post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems with his hat behind his back.
“They took me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They've taken on me!
And then they say I have no way out," he said — the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “You say I don’t have a way out?”, adding: “I’m going to put on a superman’s pelery, so you won’t be able to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Let's accept it."
His words twice caused the public to “blow up” and the members of the SNL team looked confused — reports Variety. The person in the studio during these events: “The study was dominated by a grave silence.”
West was invited to the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West was intrigued by many of the songs I Love It in Perrier's bottle of water.
West received support from the head of TPUSA’s conservative group, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the most courageous: YOUNG PEOPLE TO PLAY THE MAFII.”
Karen Hunter, the talk show’s host, said on Twitter that West was “just being himself and it’s absolutely great.”
“But I will NOT reward people (by buying her music or clothes or supporting her ‘art’) who, I think, accept an ideology that is widely harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are free as well,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now "formally called Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name – he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and the music legend, Prince, changed the name to a symbol, followed by an artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder of stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is due to appear before a court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecutor's office.
Star Game of Thrones Kit Harington moves the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval HBO series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor hit the macho hero stereotype, saying that showing such roles on the screen causes young boys to often think they have to play hard to be respected.
Giving an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her partner in the Game of Thrones plan, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted that she felt “certainly enough” moving the issue.
“I personally feel pretty sure at this point — where did we make a mistake on the subject of masculinity?” he said.
“What did we teach men when they were growing up, looking at the perspective of the problem we are dealing with right now?”
Kit believes that the development of toxic maleness can be partly responsible for television due to the presentation of very male characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are born, and what are taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets, what makes young boys begin to think that they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change that?
It’s clear that not everything is okay with young men.”
In the interview, he also confessed that he will no longer play in any prequel or sequel to the Game of Thrones after the series ends the following year, saying that he “ends with battlefields and horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will play Sam Shepard's "True West", a story about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best thing that has happened to him in the Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the plane, which provided me with my future family and a new life,” he said.
In this multiple-award winning Emmy of the fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, an object of love for the character of Kita's character, Jonah Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family home in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14 percent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this problem, as reported by the country’s health service.
In the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sexual intercourse, which means a change from the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with the HIV virus in this way was almost completely reduced, as Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year by year, the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Transmitting HIV through sex is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people from the LGBT community is common.
Taking into account the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease result from insufficient protection when having sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her team members has disclosed the data of the Republican Party senators — these are “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theory.”
A member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, on Saturday rejected allegations that a member of her team had placed the personal data of three Republican senators on Wikipedia's website.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party said the allegations were made by experts and websites linked to the “ultra-right wing.”
“Lies, lies, and even more nefarious lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information apparently contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person in the Capitol during a panel hearing in the Senate over allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after Kavanaugh's candidacy was questioned by three senators.
Conservatives, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and published information about a member of the Waters team, Hill said.
“This baseless accusation is completely false and it’s a one hundred percent lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my team — whose identity, personal data, and security have been breached as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations — was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false, and it is a one hundred percent lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including from Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
“This way of denying is bad,” Fleischer wrote.
“It suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they can't be angry.
He can't provoke.
It cannot question the motives of the person making the complaint.
He must remain calm for that.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate starting in midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It’s a big deal, if that’s true,” he wrote on Twitter.
In a statement, Waters said her office had notified “the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent allegations.”
"The judges will be exposed and brought to legal responsibility for all their actions, which pose a threat to any of the members of my team," she said.
Johnny English: Nokaut - a spy parody with a weakened Rowan Atkinson
The search for references to Brexit in every new film with a British theme has already become the norm. It seems to apply this in the case of a new part of the series of films from the genre of action and comedy "Johnny English", which started in 2003 from the film "Johnny English" in the movie "Johnny English" in the year 2011 and which echoes
Will the self-smiling satire of how hopeless we are become the new export goods of the country?
In any case, an eternally surprising, rubber-like face, incompetent Johnny English has once again received a license to share — his name and name more than anything else signals that he is an elaborate, comical product intended for non-visual viewers.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange tastes for smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Jasia Fasoli and a drop of this guy adding one note to the melody of the 2012 lead vocals of the Olivier's Olivier Ire of Fire.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world-class secretive man — Atkinson once played in forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, in which he left chaos behind.
In the latest Johnny English series, one or two moments are worth noting.
I really liked the scene in which Johnny English approached the helicopter, being dressed in a medieval armor, while the rotor blades hit rhythmically with his helmet.
The screen clearly shows Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low-flying and unnecessary, especially since now also “serious” film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible, offer comedy elements as a comedy.
The humorous elements seem to be aimed at children rather than adults — in my opinion Johnny English’s crazy adventures are not as inventive and consistent as the gags in Atkinson’s films about Jasie Fasoli.
It has always been a current assumption that the UK is in serious trouble.
Cyberhaker infiltrates the UK’s top-secret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the area — to the terror of a service agent, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
This is the last drop in the bitter charm of the prime minister, who is a pompous, spoiled character already suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything in her power, focusing on the character of Theresa May, but she does not give up.
Her advisors from the intelligence agency inform her that due to the disclosure of the identity of all active spies, she will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English in his own person, now employed as a teacher in some elegant school, giving unofficial lessons on how to become a secret agent — a few nice gags while giving English a spying lesson.
English is called to Whitehall for reuniting with his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with the captain of an underwater boat—a cheerful but somewhat tired character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin partaking in the secret service of Her Royal Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously mastered by the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims he can solve the UK’s computer problems — he is the evil Jason Volt, owned by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crusade with absurd situations: dressed as waitresses set the French restaurant on fire; they bring chaos, sneaking aboard a luxury Volta yacht; and English sow destruction while using the kit for virtual reality in order to get involved in Voltaire.
In this last sequence all the limitations disappear, however, despite the nice and playful performance, the whole film very much resembles television for children.
Typical mediocre.
As with other Johnny English films, I couldn’t resist thinking: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really match his talent?
The Labour Party denies, as if, developing a plan that provides the British with a four-day work week for which they will be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering the introduction of a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week, receiving pay in five days.
The party apparently wants the heads of companies to pass on the savings they have received through the artificial intelligence (AI) development revolution, giving them an extra day off.
As a result, employees would be able to enjoy a three-day weekend, earning the same amount of pay.
Sources say that the idea will “belong” to the party’s economic agenda and plans for the country’s exit from workers.
The transition to a four-week work week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for employees to benefit from economic change.
A senior Labour member in an interview with The Sunday Times said: “It is expected that a policy change will be announced before the end of this year.”
“This will not happen day by day, but a four-week work week is something that fits in with the party’s approach to restoring economic balance to the benefit of the employee, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party committed to introducing a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
At present, however, these plans are not supported by all members of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-year work week is not a party policy and its introduction is not considered by it.”
John McDonnell, Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet, used last week’s Labour Conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “faceless directors” and “speculators” in public utility companies.
The Chancellor’s plans from the shadow cabinet also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover all of their share, as the Labour government could make “devaluations” based on detected abuses.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and create integrative equity funds in order to transfer 10 per cent of the company’s capital from the private sector to employees who receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer “60 Minutes” in the program to the question of whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could cause them to change their attitude.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and led to a question as to whether the findings of the investigation could be republished.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, who runs the 60 Minutes program, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that could lead to a change in their attitude.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“On my way to the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened when this charge came up, and I asked, "Did you do that?"
He was strong, determined, and unambiguous.”
Graham’s opinion, however, seems to be carved in stone.
“I’ve made a decision on Brett Kavanaugh and a strong accusation is needed to change it,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people he gives could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t think anything will change.”
What is the event of the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to the reduction of poverty to some extent?
Next Saturday in New York, the Global Citizen Festival will be held, an annual music event that can boast of an extremely impressive composition of emerging stars and an equally impressive mission – the eradication of poverty in the world.
The seventh Global Citizen Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performances of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the realization of the most important goal of this year’s event.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of anti-poverty activists by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (unless it was decided to purchase a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or other significant requests for action.
But what successes can Global Citizen be proud of in the perspective of the remaining 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to take action, or another case of so-called “clitivism” when people feel they are doing something important by signing an online petition or posting a post on Twitter?
Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” by people supporting the action since 2011, aiming to achieve many different goals.
He also claims that these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and regulations worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group raised 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, under which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that safeguards have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and realtors engaged in “helping children achieve their full potential” that promised to hand over to Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate the world’s fourth-largest poverty.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizen, such as you, we can make the social injustice, which is malnutrition, go down in history,” Tracey Ullman, the Power of Nutrition’s ambassador, said at a 2018 conference in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the quality of maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with food problems.
On one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which read, “How can I be sure that extreme poverty will be eliminated?”,
The global citizen responded in the following way: “It will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will meet and fail.
But just as in the case of the once great civil rights movements and the fight against apartheid, we will be successful because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the stars at this year’s New York event, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use a navy to “block” Russia’s energy exports — Secretary of the Interior
Washington can “run away if necessary” to its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke — Washington Examiner said in a statement.
Zinke maintained that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government — is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is the desire to mediate in the energy trade, as is the case in Eastern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, because of its navy, has the ability to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, to create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not hit the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He also compared Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
“The economic option between Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuel,” he said, comparing Russia to a “tuitionist who knows one trick” with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
These statements came at a time when the Trump administration is continuing a mission aimed at increasing the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe — which is a much cheaper option for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, the Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “slave” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an economic-only project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project stems solely from economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy in Moscow, Russia.
The position of the United States has provoked a strong reaction from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the United States to refrain from interfering in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I think it’s a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supplies,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said she was considering running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the broken government, and so is the woman who holds the highest office,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will consider my candidacy for president.”
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying that he “leads the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am very worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren, without a garden, expressed her criticism of Trump and his candidacy for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that most Warren voters do not think she should run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters who chose the option “probably” said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Twenty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy — 38 percent of people supported his potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposed it.
Other well-known names from the Democratic camp, taken into account in relation to the potential nomination in 2020, were former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Talks About PTSD Track Palin During Donald Trump's Electoral Age
Track Palin (26 years old) spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he has to go through after he returns, I understand other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are returning with,” Trump said at an election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son's arrest a "tobacco subject", after which she said of her son and other war veterans: "They come back a little different, they come back locked up, they come back, wondering if there will be any respect for what their fellow soldiers and soldiers are doing."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, incitement to false testimony in a domestic violence report, and possession of weapons in a state of incarceration, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the fight against a new policy on granting asylum
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to the new U.S. policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts filed a letter on Friday in Washington, D.C., to support an asylum seeker who is struggling with this policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the cause in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal politics, was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and his brutal gang sons” were angry at her, but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys for the U.S. State of Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as countries struggling with common problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the District of Columbia, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores the state, federal and international law that has been in force for decades.”
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates this principle,” the amicus curi<0xC3><0xA6> letter said.
Prosecutors further argued in the letter that the policy of refusing immigrants to enter harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they can become entrepreneurs and “establish the necessary labor force.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang-raped violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or because of belonging to a particular social group or having such and not other political beliefs,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems – even the serious ones – that people from all over the world struggle with on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palo in a situation where the death toll has doubled in a race aimed at finding survivors.
For the survivors, the situation became more and more tragic.
“It’s a very intense feeling,” said Risa Kusuma’s 35-year-old mother, comforting her hot-tempered son in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance brings the body.
There is no clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to destroyed homes, searching for things flooded with water, and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, were quickly overcrowded.
Some of the wounds, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, were resting outside the military hospital in Pal, where patients were treated outside due to severe secondary shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he spoke of a violent earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think I was pushed into the noise of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, and her voice was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of “waiting” for propaganda ads.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S.-American propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid addition to the China Daily in the Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in Iowa — accusing China of trying to run for office in the U.S. Congress — of reprisals from the U.S. Senate.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election has confirmed what U.S. officials told Reuters that it is a new stage in the escalation of a campaign by Washington aimed at blackmailing China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are now leading to an escalation of the trade war that has led to raising tariffs on mutual imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were intended to affect exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a long-time governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had done harm to U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register that China “now with double force begins to harass by placing propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“By taking advantage of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of speech and the free press, placing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
For this reason, in a kiosk on the street in Beijing there will be no voices of opposition and there will be no real reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese may have on the disturbing economic direction defended by China, taking into account that the media is under control.
He added that "one of the most well-known Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are raping each other before mid-term elections for women with the right to vote through a Kavanaugh affair, analysts warn
While many leading Republicans support and weapons nominee to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several sexual assault allegations, the analyst warns that your members will meet during the upcoming midterm elections with fiercely squabbles.
The emotions associated with this event are extremely high, and most Republicans already want to vote officially.
“This cannot be undone,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, said in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts as to whether Senator Jeff Flake’s (Arizona) efforts to conduct a recent FBI investigation were enough to calm down the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget this tomorrow and they will not forget it until November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, a Washington-based newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan “November is coming,” demonstrating in the Senate Hall due to Republicans controlling the Judiciary Commission’s decision not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
“The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond scale,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, in a statement.
“People say it was already high — and that’s true.
But it can be higher, especially among indecisive women from suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she described in detail her allegations of sexual assault directed at a candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if the Republicans had decided to approve the candidacy, they might have failed.
“The Republican Party has to deal with a little mess,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about voting for the commission or the final vote, it’s also about whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it’s about how Republicans handled the situation and how they treated Ford,” said Guy Cecil, a Democrat in the U.S. news outlet.
However, the Americans seem to be a little divided as to who to believe in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more support for the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or rather believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent found that they strongly or rather believed in Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied while testifying, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI began an investigation into Ford’s allegations, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh under the influence of alcohol attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitalia while attending college at Yale University in the 80s of the last century.
The creator of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform — Solid — owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company Berners-Lee joked that the goal of creating Inrupt is “dominance over the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the startup.
“A historic moment has come.”
The app uses Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own “online store with personal data” or other POD.
It may include contact lists, lists of things to do, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
A unique feature of an online store with personal data is that it completely depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to the company’s president, John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is to provide resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
Currently, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of programmers-volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world have been able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change that will make all their business models turn upside down from day to day.
“Don’t ask them permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a post on Medium on Saturday that “Inrupt’s mission is to deliver commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has given a lot to the debate about net neutrality.
Inrupt Berners-Lee is the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely excited to be thinking about the next era in network development,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Denomination of the Spiritual Cross of Victoria during World War I
The memory of the only spiritual Church of England, which during World War I as a combatant was marked by the Victoria Cross, was commemorated 100 years later in his hometown.
Bernard Vann's nobleman was appointed on 29 September 1918 for the landing at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never finding out that he had been awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at the Rushden Parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that the unveiling of the stone exactly on the 100th anniversary of his grandfather’s designation was “an exceptionally symbolic character.”
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very dense fog and under a strong shot from field and machine guns."
He then rushed to the line of fire and with "the greatest courage" he led it forward, after which he single-handedly allowed an attack on the position of field forces, destroying three of them.
Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I would never be able to relax, but at the same time something humble.”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he made a wreath after the completion of a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he feels "very honored to be able to take part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is manifested in the support he receives from many people."
MMA fans did not sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 gala, instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you haven’t slept all night to watch the emotionally packed Galla Bellator 206 and finally not be able to see the main fight.
The San Jose gala program featured 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for battle, viewers in the UK were shocked by the change of the program to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after they didn’t sleep until early in the morning, especially after seeing this fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change to a children’s cartoon as “some sick joke.”
“According to the government regulation, this kind of content is inappropriate for it to be released at 6 a.m., so a change to the children’s program was necessary,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pepp's pig, yes."
Bellator’s chairman, Scott Coker, said they are working on a schedule to take viewers from the UK into account in the future.
“When I think about the repetition of the situation, I think we can fix it,” Coker said.
“But it’s Sunday morning, so we won’t be able to cope with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change in the program, we were overwhelmed by a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't a failure, it was just a legal issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen again.
We will limit the program to five fights instead of six — that is, to the standard amount. We wanted to please the fans too much and unfortunately we overdo it.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "worse" because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
On the Desert Island Discs program of Radio 4, conducted by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual host of this program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing on Laverne’s first-ever program, Daley said that as he grew up, he felt “less valuable” than others because “the simultaneous liking of boys and girls was not socially acceptable.”
He said, “To this day, it’s a sense of lesser value and being different is something that gives me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove he was “something worth it” so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally learn about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a vocal activist in the LGBT community and has used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to a larger number of countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to express himself because he felt happy to be able to live openly, without any implication, and in this way he wanted to give others “hope”.
A three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man — the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — “surprised him.”
Daley married the Oscar winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, noting that such a age difference was never a problem for him.
“When you go through so much at such a young age,” he meant his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father’s death from cancer three years later, “he said it was difficult for him to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar experiences.
The couple became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said that his perception of certain things had completely changed.
“Last year, the most important thing for me was to win a gold medal,” he said.
“And you know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics — he wanted to take place in the first place.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not going to be with us to be in the first place, Dad,'" he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
“I knew this was what I’d dreamed of all my life — jumping into the water in front of a crowd at the Olympics — it was the best feeling I could have,” he said.
He was also inspired by the choice of the first song — Proud by Heather Small — that accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympic Games and which still adorns him with dense skin.
The Desert Island Discs program is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Lack of Mickelson form on bench during Saturday’s Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but will have to work on his form to keep her pent-up.
Mickelson, playing for the twelfth time in a two-year event, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk during Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case with him in the United States team, a five-time major winner had to spend a day on pitching the team and working on improving his game in hopes of fixing his cause.
The 48-year-old, who has never had the easiest strokes, even at the peak of his career, doesn’t prove himself well on the tight field of Le Golf National, where the wrong strokes are mercilessly punished by the long roughs.
And if the field itself is not discouraging enough for Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, he must face the precision of the winner of the British Open — Francesco Molinari, who joined forces with debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of these matches.
If the Americans (with a loss of four points at the start of 12 singles) start the game with a werve, Mickelson’s match may prove extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player — rather, he couldn’t do anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, grabbed my hand and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He is very confident.
He is in the gallery of fame and has contributed a lot to the game of his teams both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there would be more, but that's how it happened and that's what we had to do.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This may mean the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draws on his account. Furyk said his presence has brought a lot to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, funny, and it’s good to have him in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the young players had a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He brings in a lot more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a major point advantage may soon shrink.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before starting the single on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Danish made his debut in 1997 in a match at the Valderrama field, where he had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the finish line went by the shortest of the hair, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>131.
“We had a big advantage on the Valderrama field; we also had a big advantage on the Brookline field, where we lost, and in the case of the Valderrama field we won only by hair,” said Bjorn, in the photo, after winning the 5-3 Class of 2018 both in a draw and in a drink.
Time will show me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow, you'll do everything you can.
Go out there and do what you have to do.
The end will be only when the points appear on the board.
We have a goal to win the trophy, and that’s what we need to focus on.
From the beginning, I said I was focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know well who the people on the other side are – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, delighted with the way his players handled themselves in a difficult field, added: “I wouldn’t do it any better.
But tomorrow is something else.
Tomorrow the singles will begin, and that’s another matter.
It’s good to play with your partner when everything goes according to your thoughts, but when you’re playing alone, your golfing skills are tested to the limit of opportunity.
This is the message that you have to pass on to the players, it is to give tomorrow everything of itself.
Your partner has to do everything.”
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect his players to achieve better results in singles than during the game with his partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced large returns of action on the last day as a member of the winning team on the Brookline field, after which he suffered a defeat after the European team performed a "miracle on the Medinah field".
“I remember every word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, was warming up to fight his players on the last day.
“Tomorrow we’re playing 12 important matches — you’d like to start the game at a fast pace, as happened in the Brookline and Medinah fields.
If this momentum goes one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the midfield matches.
We set up our squad accordingly and set the guys up in a way that would allow us to charm the day after tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of leading the contract by facing Rory McIlroy in the main game, as well as Paul Case, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter — other European team champions.
“I’ve decided on this group of guys in this row because I think he’ll manage the whole game,” Bjorn said of his singles selections.
The German Navy's new warship has been delayed again.
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War era, but this will not happen until at least next year due to the misalignment of the ship’s hulls and hulls.
The deployment of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, was moved to the first half of 2019, as reported by the newspaper Die Zeit, referring to the words of a military spokesman.
The ship was to be incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but due to the problems that arose after delivery, it was necessary to introduce changes in this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class units ordered by the navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful unit, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technological solutions that prevent detection, ensuring, among other things, the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance — the operation of new frigates should be possible even for two years away from the mother ports.
“Continuous delays, however, mean that these modern warships, which are intended to enable Germans to respond to situations abroad, will be obsolete at the time of the start of the service,” reports Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the front pages of the newspaper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to surrender the ship and turned it over to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media reported on a number of key "software and equipment bugs" that made the ship useless in a combat mission.
Particularly important were the software flaws, as the Baden-Wuertemberg-class ships are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which is half as much as the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is much too heavy, which reduces its achievements and limits the possibility of carrying out future modernizations by the navy.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the problem also becomes the cost of the entire project — including crew training.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion), while the initial cost was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the use of new frigates take on special significance in the light of the latest warnings that the forces of the German naval fleet are shrinking.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, admitted that the sailors “end ships capable of use”.
He also said that this problem has increased over time as a result of the withdrawal from the operation of old units without providing replacement ships.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be included in the navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of the novices.
The new research carried out in the Highlands estate in Scotland aims to show how non-operators make use of the landscape during food harvesting.
The results of the study are expected to shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help direct future actions to protect them.
The research, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will focus on pelvic pelvis and small pelvis, as well as long-eared brown bats and red-legged bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
In key locations around the property, special registrars will be deployed in order to track the activity of the neuters throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field research using portable detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings is aimed at determining the frequency of signals sent by the neuter and the manner in which the individual species behave.
Then, a map and a report will be developed to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS’ Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of work related to the management of settlements, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best ways to maintain forest land for neuters and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which has an impact on fences and the loss of settlements.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a threat, as well as fly adhesives and some chemicals used in building materials, and even domestic cats.
Nonsmokers aren't really blind.
However, due to the nocturnal habits, their ears are more helpful than the eyes in catching will gain.
They use the complex technique of echolocation to search for worms and obstacles on their way.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, treats the neuters very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, check-ups, and sometimes even rescue actions.
The organisation has even established the first and only dedicated reserve of bats in Scotland at the Threadave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten Scottish species of bats.
David Thompson, the property manager, says that it is the ideal territory for the novices.
“Threave has a great area for toddlers,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a great settlement.
However, there are still a lot of unknowns when it comes to neutering. The work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.”
It underlines the importance of checking for the presence of neuters before proceeding to carry out conservation work in the estates, because the unintentional destruction of a single rod can kill up to 400 males and young, which can lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Non-stoppers are under protection — killing, harassing or harassing them, as well as destroying their rod is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged public opinion to provide assistance.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our nonopers, and for many species we don’t even know how their populations cope.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape, while his lawyers plan to sue a German magazine <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the allegations of rape as “fake news,” saying people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German information magazine Der Spiegel, who published these allegations.
Portuguese Juventus attacker was charged with raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to reports from Der Spiegel on Friday, the footballer was supposed to pay a woman $375,000 for silence.
Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the charges were announced, in an Instagram live feed addressed to his 142 million followers, described these reports as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today’s reports are fake news,” said the five-time winner of the gold ball.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of my job.
I’m happy and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile on his lips.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel in connection with allegations they have called “an unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek compensation for “moral damage in the amount of the corresponding weight of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The event was supposed to take place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel room in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player’s room, where he allegedly raped a woman anally — as evidenced by documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99 percent is a good guy", which was visited by this "one percent".
According to the documentation, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but this was done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "feared of retaliation" and "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she wants to cancel the deal now because she still can’t forget about the alleged breakup.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this year he moved to Juventus after paying <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million for him.
Brexit: Britain ‘would always regret’ the departure of car manufacturers <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The UK would “sadly regret it all the time” if it lost the status of world leader in car manufacturing after leaving the European Union, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "concerned" when a Toyota UK representative told the BBC in an interview that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, production at a factory in Burnaston near Derby will be temporarily halted.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
A representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to a reduction in jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis models are produced, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March without an agreement, then there will be a halt in production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British automakers fear leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW plans to close its Mini car factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern, as the car manufacturers claim, are the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a UK exit from the European Union without agreement.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts reaching every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU in the case of custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be difficulties at the border, which, according to industry representatives, could lead to delays and shortcomings in parts.
As the company’s representative said, Toyota would not be able to withstand more than one day without deliveries to its Derbyshire factory, so production would be halted.
Clark said Chequers Theresa May’s plan for future EU relations was “precisely designed to avoid border controls.”
"We need an agreement, we want to achieve the best possible agreement that will not only allow us to enjoy the current success, but also allow us to make the most of this situation," he said on BBC Radio 4 today.
“The statements not only by Toyota but also by other manufacturers demonstrate that we need to be able to continue what has been a very efficient set of supply chains.”
Toyota’s representative was unable to determine how long the production would be halted, but warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been at the Burnaston facility for 24 years and is a member of the board of the union organization Unite, said the union members are increasingly concerned: “From experience, I know that if jobs are eliminated, they will never be restored again.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, as the White House reports
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “slowed down by another week” due to an ongoing fight over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the possibility of Russian interference in the election, links between Trump’s close associates and Russia, and potential impeding actions to measure justice by the president.
Whether Trump will release a deputy attorney general, thereby threatening Mueller’s independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a hearing to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these reports.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports as if he were to resign.
The date of the meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was set for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein. It was time to postpone the meeting to avoid colliding with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, during which testimony was filed by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blase.
On Friday, Trump conducted a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying a vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The deadline for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week, or it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, I’ll tell the press about it.”
A few journalists questioned this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The program's executive, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said a small number of press conferences were not caused by an unwillingness to "ostentatious" television journalists, after which she added: "I will not hide that they are "ostentatious".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The current president is holding more 'questions and answers' sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding without giving any evidence: "We have come to terms with the numbers."
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States questions directly, that’s a much better solution than talking to me.
We are trying to do this regularly, and in the last few weeks we have done it very often. Press conferences will give way to such sessions, during which it will be possible to speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly responds to questions while leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with guest dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are a rarity.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why he is, behaving too freely and sometimes strangely in front of the assembled journalists.
Health Minister Writes to Employees from European Union Countries Employed in NHS Scotland in Face of Brexit-Related Concerns
The Minister of Health has sent a letter to employees from the European Union countries employed in the Scottish Health Service to convey their thanks to the country and ask them not to leave after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of examining applications for the award of ‘setled status’ for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “In the summer, negotiations on the UK’s exit from the European Union continued, and appropriate decisions will be taken in the fall of this year.
The British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible exit scenario without a deal.
I know this is a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleges from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and bring benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
“Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery due to head injury
Christion Abercrombie, the head coach of the Tennessee State Tigers, underwent surgery as a result of a head injury in Saturday's game with Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended in a 31-27 defeat for the Tennessee team, Mike Organ said.
Rod Reed, head coach of the Tennessee State team, told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the end of the first half.
“He went to the sideline, then he fell to the ground,” Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, then put it on their noses and carried out further tests.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details yet about the type/size of the injury,” and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a second-year student fired from representing the university for a year to train his skills) plays his first season in the Tennessee State team after a transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the end of the game, he had five grays, giving him 18 grays throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax rate on the purchase of real estate in the UK.
According to the new plans, the torys buying from abroad will be charged higher tax charges for the purchase of real estate in the UK. The funds obtained in this way will be allocated to the homeless.
This move is intended to bring down the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract a young electorate.
The tax increase will include people who do not deduct taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Department predicts that it will get as much as <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that a higher tax rate will be charged to foreigners buying property in the UK, and the additional funds obtained in this way will be earmarked for homeless assistance.
This move is seen as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract a young electorate with promises of cheaper housing and increase the burden on more earners.
Higher tax rates will apply to individuals and non-taxable businesses in the UK. The additional measures are intended to help the government in the fight against homelessness.
The additional fee — charged in addition to the current tax rate, including the higher rates for second homes and apartments purchased for rent two years ago — may be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects that this move will allow it to raise as much as <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult to buy a first home or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy real estate, and spend most of their time abroad, many rich regions—and especially the capital—have transformed into a “city of spirits.”
The new rules come just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut that would help young people buy a first home.
He accused major developers of keeping high real estate prices by occupying the land, but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to lift the limits of cheap housing in order to eliminate the “residential scandal” in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including asset regulation and the end of the “no reason” exit.
It also wants to give local authorities greater powers to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year, I said that as prime minister, I am committed to rebuilding the British dream of making every next generation’s life better than the previous one.
This also means the repair of our busy housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can easily buy real estate here as hard working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become very distant, so the humiliation associated with the need to stay overnight on the street remains even more real.”
Jack Ross: “My biggest ambition is to be Scotland’s national team coach”
Sunderland team coach Jack Ross says his “biggest ambition” is to become a Scotland coach at some point.
This forty-two-year-old Scottish is committed to the recovery of the North-East club, which currently ranks third in League One with a three-point loss to the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this year after he introduced the St Mirren club back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only managed to get to B," Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“As a child, I often watched with my father the Scottish game in Hampden and it always attracted me.
However, such an opportunity will come only on condition that I succeed as a club coach.”
Among Ross' predecessors as coach Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn’t feel disgruntled, taking on the role of so famous personalities in such a big club, previously rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success will now be measured by whether I will be able to bring this club back to the Premier League.
Given its structure and the convenience it has, there is undoubtedly a place for it,” he added.
“It’s not going to be easy, but I’m sure I’ve succeeded here, only on condition that I succeed.”
Ross's coaching career has been going on for only three years. He was previously assistant coach at Dumbarton and for 15 months was part of the Hearts coaching team.
He then helped Alloa to advance again after being demoted to the third league, and in the following season led the St Mirren team from a fall to the championship.
Jack Ross says he now feels much more comfortable than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real turning point" — so mentions the position of coach Allo.
“I really believed that running a team is much better for me than playing it.
It sounds strange, because as a player, I did my job, I made good money, and I achieved some measurable success.
However, playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week you have to wake up to different situations.
They still meet me when it comes to stress and pressure related to the work of the coach, but I feel good in this role.
I’ve always wanted to train others and now I’m doing it. I can say that right now I feel the most at the place in my adult life.”
The entire interview at Sportsound can be listened to on Sunday, September 30 on radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
Studies show that the best time to brew beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heatwave caused a sudden influx of customers to British pubs, but it bounced back in the restaurant networks.
Studies have shown that in July sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent, but in restaurants dropped by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of CGA’s consulting firm, which developed the data, says: “Continuous heats and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Championships have caused the results of July to form similar to June’s, when the turnover in pubs is increasing by 2 percent.
In June, the 1.8 per cent drop in restaurant sales in July was even greater.
The drinks offered by pubs and bars were definitely the best — their sales growth exceeded the drop recorded in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered during the heats, although not as much as restaurant owners.
It looks like people were just being wanted.
Sales of beverages in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent this month, and food sales fell by three per cent.”
Paul Newman, from RSM, which analyzes the entertainment and tourism industry, says: “These results fit in with the trend we’ve observed since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the size of consumption 'outside the home' remain the weather and large sporting or social events.
The fact that restaurant networks are experiencing difficult times is not surprising, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the previous year will have particularly dire consequences if you take into account the ongoing pressure to cut costs.
The long and hot summer has come at the least favorable moment for the owners of the premises serving food and time will show whether the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring such a necessary breath.”
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, taking into account the newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the development of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. It sets recognised industry standards.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
Studies have shown that one in five children — some as young as 11 — have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase in the number of “fake Insta” pages.
The news has raised concerns that there are sexually explicit content published on it.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” account that shows their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, set up social media accounts that they don’t disclose to adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta” accounts — the name refers to an Instagram site where photos can be shared.
The news has raised concerns that these accounts are used to publish sexually explicit content.
Twenty percent of students admitted that they have a “main” account, which they show to their parents, and they also have a private account.
One of the mothers, who accidentally bumped into the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, met a teenager who urged others to “rape her.”
A study conducted in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Association Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of students between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, half of which are admitted to holding private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are creating their own places on the internet where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of athletes on the Scottish Athletics board
During the annual general meeting of the Scottish Athletics management Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board as non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is the most well-known Scottish athlete. President Ian Beattie has described this move as an excellent opportunity for people who manage sports to benefit from her rich international experience she has gained over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys tremendous respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic communities and we are confident that its introduction to the board will bring great benefits to Scottish athletics,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very pleased that I will have the opportunity to give advice to the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can really help in managing the sport in Scotland.”
An American who, among his four Olympic gold medals, has won the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and now regularly appears in the BBC as an expert, cannot walk as a result of a passing unscathed attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time will show whether I will regain my fitness and to what extent.
It was a quatrain job, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again, and I got back to training!
Thank you for all the words of support!”
Advertising of lactators, which compare mothers to cows, excites extreme emotions on the Internet
The company that produces lactators has caused a storm on the internet, publishing an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to breastfed cows.
To announce the launch of “the world’s first silent lactator to wear under clothing,” its producer, Elvie, has published a ridiculous advertisement in the form of a television that underscores the freedom it provides to mothers.
It depicts four real mothers dancing in a swan-filled camp to a song where they hear the words, "Yes, I do, but I don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice, it's not just my tits."
And the reference goes like this: “Pull them out, pump them out, feed them to the children, pump them out, pump them out, touch my lady.”
The ad, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, caused great controversy on the Internet.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them argue that it is inappropriate to joke about the “horror” that takes place in the dairy industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Just like people, in order to give milk, they need to get pregnant and give birth to their bodies, with their children being taken away from them a few days after their birth,” one user wrote.
Elvie's lactator can be worn unnoticed under a feeding bristle (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “Of course, this is traumatic for both the mother and the child.
Okay, let's use cows to advertise lactators for mothers who can stop their children."
Someone else added: “This ad is completely detached from reality.”
Others are gunning for the clip — one of the women said that she thought the song was “fun.”
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was still breast feeding, I'd buy one.
When I was eating, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I can't find a second bottom in it.
It’s a brilliant invention,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who take away food (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘sheep’.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry.”
At the end of the film, it turns out that women danced with lactators attached discreetly to the chest.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many feeding women feel like cows.
However, Elvie's lactator is completely silent, there are no cables or tubes and it can be worn under the chestnut to feed, giving women the freedom to move, hold children on their hands, and even leave the house while pulling food.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, said: “The Elvie Lactator is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative premiere.
By bringing together feeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to show all the challenges associated with food withdrawal, while at the same time presenting in a fun and consistent way the incredible sense of freedom it provides.
This isn't the first time that lactator Elvie has hit the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, during the Marty Jakubowski show, the mother of two children with the same product appeared on the run.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained children of immigrants is growing rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border each month does not change properly. This is due in part to the fact that the strict rhetoric and rules introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children in detention.
The majority of sponsors are also usually undocumented immigrants who are afraid of the risk of deportation if they apply for a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that fingerprints would be taken from potential sponsors and other adults living in the common farm, which would then be handed over to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who had applied as sponsors for children left without care.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been previously recorded.
“Almost 80 percent of the people who are or live with them in a single household are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That’s why we are constantly chasing them,” Albence said.
As part of efforts to speed up the regulation of the situation, the children of officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention — and not after 60 days, as the standards say.
A lot will be done through videoconference, and not in person, to ask the immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who do not qualify for dismissal will be deported immediately.
According to the staff of the hostel and the reports that have been published in recent months, the longer the children are in detention, the easier they can become restless or fall into depression, which in turn can lead to explosions of aggression or attempts to escape.
Defenders found that these problems are even more serious in the case of larger centers, such as Tornillo, where because of its size it is easier to ignore the signals that something bad is happening to the child.
They also added that moving children to camp without providing them with the right time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately
During his speech before the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in that country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces were illegally staying on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “we will deal with them accordingly.”
“They have to withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the Assembly.
Moualem says the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says Damascus will continue to “lead its holy battle until it clears the territory of Syria” from both terrorist groups and from “all foreigners illegally staying on it.”
There are currently about 2,000 U.S. soldiers stationed in Syria, who are mainly engaged in training Kurdish and Syrian forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad and advising them.
In addition, in the country destroyed by the war, there are still more than 1,000 French soldiers.
As for the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions are good enough for them to return, and accused “some Western countries” of “inciting irrational fear” that discourages them from returning.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations for help in these returns,” he said.
“They politicize things that should have a purely human dimension.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad concludes a political agreement with the opposition to end the war, Syria will receive no aid for reconstruction.
U.N. diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent a major attack by Syrian forces backed by Russia on the province where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement has a "clear time frame", and expressed hope that military action would be targeted at jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Levante People's Front, who will be "eliminated".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new commission composed of members of the ruling party and the opposition to draft a draft post-war constitution for Syria and prepare for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the commission, saying the panel's work should be limited "to verify the provisions of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Election Again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected for a second term in 2020, unless — as many liberal observers are likely to hope — his presidency will end sooner with the removal from office and the scandal.
It would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency so far.”
As of now, there are no signs of audience fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s first-team viewership has more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC’s nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen Fox News, the average audience of 2.4 million viewers in the hours of greatest viewing, which is an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC program “The Rachel Maddow Show” has reached the highest ratings in the world.
“People are flying like a brick into a fire — that’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, the main producer of the ABC series “Designated Survivor” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She recalled driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
“Because it makes me laugh,” he replied.
“Chaos has an entertaining value.”
Of course, the reports from Washington could, like nothing else shown on television, judge the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the admissibility of connecting immigrant families, or the state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
In addition, it’s not just about being a well-informed citizen of Daniela’s when you watch the sixth hour of the panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s use of secret informants while writing the book “Fear”, about Paul Manafort’s jacket, and about a 15 000-pound swab.
I will never look at Super Mario the same way I did before.
“What he’s doing is partly reminiscent of the reality show in that it delivers new content every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing cast and the daily returns of the show’s NFL cast.
You can't afford to miss the episode, because you'll have a hangover.
When I met Mike Fleisse this week, the weather on the north coast of Kauai Island, where he has his home, was beautiful, but he was sitting in the middle watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He could not get away with it, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Judiciary Commission and weighed the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember how we used to do all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right.”

The influx of money from outside to the election campaign to Congress
It is not surprising that after the reorganisation of the electoral districts, as a result of which in the race for one position will now be two incumbent congressmen, until the 17th constituencies in Pennsylvania, the cash river flows.
This newly formed suburban district of Pittsburgh is represented in Congress by a Democrat representative, Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district during the special election last spring.
Lamb is competing with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents District 12 in Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new District 17.
The county's maps were corrected following a January ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which ruled that the old counties had been unfairly designated, giving the Republicans an advantage and was unconstitutional.
The race in the new 17th district began with the fight to fund a campaign between the party’s main funding bodies – the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning by hair in widely commented elections to the 18th Electoral District, which took place in March.
For more than a decade, a Republican has been sitting in this position, and Donald Trump has won this district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew from the idea.
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, despite a slight opposition to Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela, and by the time the Trump Organization’s managing team partners had a hotel in Panama.
U.S. Department of State officials have decided to revoke the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," the department's spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
However, the sanctions were to be imposed only on El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including the fight against drugs and support for development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which would have included restrictions on financial aid and visas for certain individuals, would be very appealing to this Central American country, which is struggling with high unemployment and a high rate of murder.
In the course of the progress of the international meetings, the North and Central American officials have postponed a high-level conference, which was intended to address the security and economic well-being, in order to deal with the conclusions of a similar meeting from the previous year, which was
In mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats say that now at the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence is due to speak, which is supposed to be a sign of an invitation to the meeting of administration representatives.
The three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, and were not accompanied by any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman, John Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were presented by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who, on condition of anonymity, agreed to discuss internal pertracts.
Their relations were confirmed by an external analyst from the administration’s environment, who also spoke anonymously.
Learn the history
Another element may be the report by the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, on the possible impeding of President Trump’s justice measures, for which concrete evidence is currently available to the public.
According to reports, the Robert Mueller investigation also investigated whether Donald Trump’s campaign had anything to do with Russia’s attack on the U.S. election.
If the composition of Congress changes, President Trump will be held accountable by him in preparation for re-election, or perhaps even be tried in front of the jury.
There are a lot of unknowns here and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump – not even people in his parallel positions in Europe – is inevitable.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic need to make a choice that will decide how long it can last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out the coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We did not succeed and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of cuts that followed.
The wheels of history revolve around such turning points, speeding up or slowing down the inevitable path of democracy.
There are now a few such turning points in front of the Americans.
What will we do if Donald Trump releases Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future of Robert Mueller’s investigation depends?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since we revealed in our paper that last year he proposed a covert recording of the president and speculated that he was not fit for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the report presented by The Times is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the newly ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court judge despite being pregnant with credible allegations of sexual assault and false allegations?"
And above all — will we elect to Congress in the middle of the presidential term the people who will hold Donald Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, there will be difficult times for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed — because of the lessons I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my residence as an ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light a swastika candle on that table marked with swastika.
With such a legacy, how could I not look to the future optimistically?"

Rangers player, Graham Dorrans, with optimism is waiting for a match with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the awareness that the victory with the Austrians, achieved after an impressive draw with Villareal achieved this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying for the G-League Euro group.
Until a 2:2 draw with Villareal, knee injury prevented assistant Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes that this result will work on the Rangers as a springboard for greater success.
“We did well because Villarreal is in good shape,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went to this game with the belief that we will achieve something — and we won the point.
Maybe in the end we could still push them, but overall the draw is probably a fair result.
The Spaniards were probably better in the first half, but in the second we were better.
When it comes to Thursday, it’s another important evening for Europe.
We hope that we will get three points, but this match will be difficult, because our opponent got a good result in his last match. However, I am sure that thanks to the support of the fans we will pass and this and we will beat the positive result.
The last year was definitely tough because of everything related to my contusion and changes in the club itself, but now we’re all feeling good in our seats.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play. The training goes well.
I hope that we will be able to move on, leave the last season behind and succeed.”
Fear of Retirement Savings Spends Women’s Sleep from Age
Although the survey participants knew exactly how they wanted to deal with them, few spoke about it with the family.
In a study conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants said that they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with the kids.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t have a conversation about it,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide Life Insurance.
Where to start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You don’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your will beforehand.
Together with your counselor and family, you will discuss where and how you want to be taken care of, as this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask your financial advisor for help: He may be able to help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds may come from a traditional policy for such care, a hybrid policy that allows you to pay cash to cover such expenses, or from your own property — as long as you own it.
Prepare legal documents: You will prevent legal battles from happening thanks to this.
Designate a trusted health care officer who will oversee it and ensure that the appropriate persons act in accordance with your will, if communication becomes impossible.
Consider also the employment of a proxy who will deal with finances.
Choose a trusted person because they will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all the bills are paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your parent in your late teens suddenly needs medical help and is just going to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all the information to have it prepared.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin says.
“What medications do you take?
Who will take care of the dog?
It’s worth having such a plan at hand.”
Man shot multiple times by windmill in Ilfracombe
The man was repeatedly shot from the windshield when he returned home from an evening party.
The 40-pounder was located in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and arm.
Police said the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. BST, was a “sudden act.”
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries are not a threat to a man's life, and the police are asking for witnesses to report the incident.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The number of victims is likely to increase.
Due to the disrupted communication, the rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala kabupaten, which is located north of Pal, closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pal.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Palu and the Donggala hut on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island. According to estimates, in 2017 there were 379,800 people.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city was celebrating the 40th anniversary of its founding.
Donggaga is a kabupaten (administrative unit with levels below the province) extending along the north-western coast of the island for more than 300 km.
It is estimated that 299,200 people lived there in 2017.
The main branches of the economy of Central Celebes are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed especially in the coast of the Donggal Cabaret.
Another source of income for the province is nickel mines, but they are mainly located in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, during the past 100 years, earthquakes and tsunamis have visited Palu and Donggala several times.
In 1938, the tsunami that struck Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, nine people died as a result of the tsunami in western Donggali.
Indonesia is located on an active seismically Pacific ring of fire, which is why earthquakes occur there quite regularly.
The biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake that hit the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, the west coast of Sumatra experienced a series of severe earthquakes.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: In the south of Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, a 6.8-degree earthquake occurred, triggering a tsunami that broke into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
As a result, more than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai off the coast of Sumatra. It caused a tsunami wave of up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya cave in Aceh province, causing havoc and panic among people who continued to remember the destruction that resulted in the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami wave, but the towering buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Large earthquakes have visited the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on its northern side.
They caused the destruction of thousands of homes and brought temporary trouble to thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Governor of Alaska and vice-presidential candidate Sary Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers from the Alaskan town of Wasilla, the 29-year-old was arrested on charges of domestic violence, making it difficult to file a complaint and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a friend of the suspect tried to call the police to report the crime, he picked up the phone.
KTUU station reports that Palin is in Mat-Su's investigative custody and has a $500 bail.
According to her information last Saturday, he stood before the court, where in his defense speech he stated that he was "certainly innocent".
Three Class A felonies are pregnant in Palin, which means she could receive a prison sentence of up to a year and $250,000 in fines.
He was also charged with a Class B offence, for which he threatened to punish the day of imprisonment and fines of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Claims Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, making it difficult to file a complaint, and possessing weapons in a state of incarceration in connection with the incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin, who linked her son’s aggressive behavior to a team of surge stressors he acquired while serving in Iraq.

When the tsunami hit the coast, on the beach in Palu, where the festival was held, there were hundreds of people.
Federal prosecutors are seeking death sentences for suspected terrorist attack in New York City <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Federal prosecutors from New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City, which resulted in the death of eight people, a rare penalty — not executed in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
To carry out the attack, which took place in October on a bicycle path running along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, thirty-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck, which he drove on his pedestrians and bicycles.
According to a notice filed in the southern district of New York that the death penalty was intended to justify its necessity, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and that he “intentionally” caused them harm.
According to the court document, both of these charges threaten the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury presented to Saip an indictment of 22 positions, including eight counts of murder as part of an illegal activity — which is a procedure usually used by federal prosecutors in cases involving motor-related crimes and motor-related crimes.
According to prosecutors, the organization of the attack required "solid planning and thinking." The way Saipov conducted it, they described it as "poor, cruel and immoral".
Sayfullo Habibullahevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erlija, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Poganza
Five of the victims were citizens of Argentina, who had been in New York touring.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in New York's southern district was ten years ago.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but eventually in September 2009 he heard a life sentence.
The death penalty as a result of the federal case was last carried out in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs. The marriage was lost after two years earlier they were found guilty of conspiracy and espionage in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were lost in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who comes from Uzbekistan, did not show any convictions within months of the attack.
Police say he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov confessed to the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS films he watched on the phone.
According to the police, he also demanded the suspension of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
The indictment, which includes 22 charges, states that he is innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders in the office who represent Saipov, said they were “for obvious reasons disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and to reject life without the possibility of early release after being convicted will only prolong the suffering that these events have brought on all those concerned,” he said.
Saipova’s defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for Brexit negotiations.
During today’s protest, which took place during the Tory conference, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army.”
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians must “feel hot” beating Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May’s parliamentarians suggested he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
A Conservative MP, Peter Bone, told protesters in Birmingham that if Farage was Brexit secretary, “the United Kingdom would be already outside the Union.”
However, the inclusion of the tories opting to remain in the community to a separate protest against Brexit, which took place in the city, further underscored the weight of the task of reconciling its deeply divided ranks, which stands before Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is trying hard to realize her plan of compromise with the Chequers amid attacks by Brexit supporters, his opponents, and the European Union itself.
Her allies say that despite the opposition, she will seek to conclude an agreement with Brussels and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to make a choice between her proposal and "chaos".
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wants to “throw out a plan with the Chequers.”
He suggested that Nigel Farage should be the proxy, to whom responsibility should be given for negotiations with Brussels.
“If it were him, we would be out of the EU now,” he said.
A Wellingborough MP said: “I support Brexit, but we have to throw out a plan from the Chequers.”
Presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: “This is not why we fought in world wars to submit to someone now.
We want to establish our rights in our own country.”
Peter Bone rejected suggestions that citizens had changed their minds since voting in 2016: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union is completely untrue.”
There was also a rally in support of the Brexit Andrea Jenkyns of the Tory Party, who told reporters: “I’m just saying: Madam Prime Minister, please listen to the people.
The plan with Chequers does not enjoy the support at all, the opposition will not vote for it, our party or our activists, who inhabit the streets and who chose us, do not support it either.
Please drop the plan with the Chequers and start listening.”
In a statement addressed to Prime Minister May, she added: “The prime ministers maintain their positions when they keep their promises.”
Nigel Farage said politicians taking part in the demonstration must “feel hot” if they were to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us — the people — and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you do that.’”
Turning to the crowd, he added: “I want you to make politicians who are on the verge of Brexit betrayal feel hot.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who gave us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom.”
During this time, opponents of Brexit marched through the city to the center, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A handful of activists waving banners “Torys against Brexit” after setting up the group this weekend.
The Labour activist, Baron Andrew Adonis, ridiculed the Conservatives for the safety of the party application at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can organize IT systems and all the technology to support the Canada Plus plan plus, a liquid border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to “seriously consider” running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she is “seriously considering running for president.”
As reported by The Boston Globe, a representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting with voters that took place on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, will apply for re-election in November. Her opponent will be Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 election.
It is now said that in the 2020 election, Warren can beat Trump.
Saturday’s Holyoke event was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall formula since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he planned to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren responded that the time had come for “women to go to Washington to fix our corrupt government — and she meant the woman on the top.”
The arrest of the killer of the fatal shooting that killed LSU team player Wayde Sims
Police from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in a Friday shooting in which an LSU basketball player, Wayde Sims, was killed.
The Baton Rouge police department reported on the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson during a conference that took place at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.
On Friday, a video of the shooting was released asking for help in identifying the man visible on it.
The 20-year-old Wayde Sims died as a result of a shooting near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head with a gun, resulting in his death,” Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, said in a statement.
Wayde stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, carrying a gun, and shooting Wayde.
After the arrest, during which he was not resisting, he was taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The 1.98 m junior Wayde Sims grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games, with the last season starting 10 times, during which he spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the pitch, scoring 5.6 points and scoring 2.9 goals per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team command has allowed him to win with Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team’s order would have a big impact on the race result.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two rounds and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the service point first and allowed Hamilton to ride in the tail of the peleton, which should decide on the fate of the race.
The Mercedes driver went to the box in the next round and appeared behind Vettel, but after the action round in the round, as a result of which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner part of the track, risking to jump to the defensive line after a double stroke.
Max Verstappen started from the end of the bet and at his 21st birthday at the end of the first round he was in seventh place.
He then drove for much of the race because he did not change his tyres to make a quick finish and to take fourth place for Kimi Raikkonen.
He finally reached the service point in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he was no longer able to accelerate. Raikkonen took fourth place.
“It was a tough day because Valtteri had been doing a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he was told to let me go.
The whole team has done everything in their power to take the first two places,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
During a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump slammed Senator Diana Feinstein, who maintained that she did not disclose the contents of a letter from Christina Blasey Ford in which she accuses Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the statements made by Christina Ford before the Senate Judiciary Commission. Instead, he stated that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are “likely to be wrong.”
“What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have been witnessing for a few days, when we see anger when we see people who are angry, angry, angry and lying,” he said.
“We see what has been published and disclosed, and then they tell us, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.’
I didn't do it.
You remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you disclose this?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document? — oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not reveal it.”
Hold on, hold on.
Did we reveal...No, we didn’t,” he added, scouring the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and its contents leaked in early September. The senator denies that the source of the leak was her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s insinuation, I didn’t disclose her history,” Feinstein told the commission.
“She asked me for discretion, and as per her request, I did not disclose these contents.”
However, her statement was not convinced by the president, who commented on it during Saturday’s meeting: “I’m telling you, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court judge, whose three women have been accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats use insinuations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power by all means.
“You see corruption, malice, they don’t care about who they hurt, who they have to destroy in order to take over power and control,” the president said in a statement.

In a match with Dundee club Patrick Dwyer won two goals for the Giants
Dundee Stars retook their fifth Elite League loss with the Belfast Giants, winning a 5:3 home game on Saturday.
The Giants quickly gained a two-door lead after the shots of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie balanced the score, after which Dwyer again led the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard again equalised the result by winning a goal for Dundee, after which two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen marked her victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's underdogs, who despite their initial loss on Friday night won with Dundee in Belfast 2:1.
The two teams met for the fourth time this season – the first three games were won by the Giants.

At the end of the second third, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen secure Dundee's first win in the match. Dundee's final victory was scored in the middle of the last third by the same player who shot the fifth goal for his team.
The Giants, who have lost four in their last five games, will play their next game at their home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies, helping hundreds of people on the plane escape from the earthquake
The air traffic controller from Indonesia was yelled at by the hero after he died, helping to safely launch a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have been identified as missing after a major earthquake struck Indonesia’s Celebes Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There are still strong secondary shocks in the area. In the city of Palu, many people have been trapped in the rubble.
Although his colleagues fled, saving his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave the position at the wheeled flight control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pal.
He stayed there to make sure that the aircraft of the Batik Air line (flight number 6321), which was just on the runway, was safely launched.
Then he jumped out of the tower when it seemed to him that they had just collapsed.
He died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, told ABC News that the controller’s decision probably saved the lives of hundreds of people.
We organized a helicopter from Balikpapan to Borneo to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthonius left this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
“This message has broken our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands. The national disaster relief agency reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“We believe that the death toll continues to rise because many bodies are still under the rubble and cannot be reached,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
A six-metre tsunami wave has destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral of the victims will take place on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances are constantly importing bodies.
There is a lack of drinking water.
Small shops are being looted.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we will stop at the scene.
It’s a tragedy, and maybe even worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal, who turned to the army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” — CNN.
This year Indonesia has already visited the earthquake, which killed more than 550 people on the island of Lombok.
A plane crash in Micronesia — Air Niugini lines report one person is missing after the plane crashed into a lagoon
Airlines operating a flight that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific, report that one person is missing. Previously, they claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini reported that according to data on Saturday afternoon they could not count one man who was travelling on a feral plane.
They made sure that together with the local authorities, hospitals and investigators they were trying to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional details concerning the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the airport on Chuuk Island, local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew members.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airlines said there were six more passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
It is not clear what was the cause of the disaster, and its exact course is also unknown.
The U.S. Air Force and Navy say the plane landed on a lagoon near the runway.
According to some witnesses, he got out of his belt.
The American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane went very low.
“This has helped us a lot,” he said.
Jaynes said he and other people managed to cross the water to the exit of the crash-landing plane reaching the belt.
According to him, the crew members panicked and shouted, and he himself suffered a dangerous head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that the rescue operation was also aided by sailors who worked closely on the modernization of the coast. With the help of a breathing boat, they managed to transport people to the shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network in the past two decades, 111 people have been killed in the crash of aircraft belonging to airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but there are no Air Niugini among them.
The analyst reconstructed the events of the night when a woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecutor’s office ended the presentation of evidence in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman’s life in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as a judicial officer in the field of information analysis.
He described to the judges how, using cell phone records, he recreated the route of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessiki Chambers, from the night she died.
According to the Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett said he had obtained location data from various cell phones that showed Tellis was from Chambers on a feral evening, and that he had thus refuted his earlier claims.
When the data confirmed that at a time when Quinton was supposed to be with his friend, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to interrogate Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in town that day.
Asked by prosecutors whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he replied that "he lied because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another inaccuracy is Tellis's claim that he had known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers Tellis died, he removed her contact details from his phone, as well as text messages and calls.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense's final speech is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that it was likely that the case would be handed over to the jury on the same day.
The High Breed – What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio want to change the negative image of the genre by filling their music with a positive message.
According to Bristol's The High Breed, today's hip-hop has dropped out of the original political content and social issues.
The members of the band want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of conscious hip-hop.
Thanks to the work of such artists as Akala and Lowkey, the revival of such artists as The Fugees and Common has been observed in the UK recently.
Another black one?!
Niania from New York poses for release after ‘racist’ SMS
Nanny from New York poses for her release from work on a racist background after receiving a misaddressed SMS, in which the child’s mother complains that she is “another black person.”
The couple denies, as if they were racists, by comparing the claim to “sanctification.”
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly distraught when it turned out that the new caregiver, Giselle Maurice, who was seriously on her first day at work in 2016, is black.
“NIEEE, ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” she wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to him, by mistake she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to reports in the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman became aware of the gaff, she "turned over" fired Giselle Maurice, claiming that the hearty nanny, who is African-American, did her duties poorly, and that she did not fail to do so.
Mrs. Maurice received a paycheck for the work day, and then was sent home to Uber.
She is now asking for a couple of compensations for a $350-a-day exemption multiplied by the six months she was originally employed with housing, even though she did not sign the contract.
“I want to show them that no such things are being done,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple rejects the accusations of racism, claiming that the termination of her cooperation with Maurice was justified because after being portrayed, they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her something she wasn’t going to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” said her husband, Joel Plasco.
“Would you trust your children to the person you’ve wronged, even if it was a mistake?
Your new-born baby?
Come on, come on."
Comparing the lawsuit to “sanctification,” Plasco said his wife was born just two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to blow up something like that?
This is not very nice,” added the investment banker.
Although the case in court has not yet ended, public opinion has quickly issued a few verdicts on social media, criticizing it for its behavior and way of thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of the books on Paddington feared that the readers did not feel a connection to the impending mission.
The author’s daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s warm reception, says of the letter: “It’s hard to stand on the spot of the person who read it for the first time, even before the book was published.
It’s very funny now that we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
She claims that her father, who, before a small plush mouse inspired him to write a children’s book, worked as a cameraman on the BBC, was confident that his work would be rejected. He also adds that after his death in the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book.
Paddington, whom he describes as “a very important member of our family,” says her father was secretly proud of his success.
“He was a quiet man, he didn’t kiss,” he added.
“But because Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something — you’re proud of him, even though it’s not your merit.
I think Paddington's success was perceived in such a way.
Although he himself invented and created it, he always paid tribute to Paddington himself.
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her by phone
After landing her daughter, she was transported to the hospital of Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“He called me regularly and said it was really bad that it probably won’t work out,” says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
He then called to say that Natasha will die in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
I did it anyway.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave her to maintain heart action, slowly stopped working and were removed from the body.
She died a while ago and that was the end of it all.
I could only sit and wait with the awareness that it was all developing.
I could not go out or cry or cry because I was among other people.
I really had to stick.”
In the end, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who had already lamented the loss of her daughter, went on board with other passengers, unaware of the pain she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
I had my head down, and my tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but in the plane, I felt the all-encompassing compassion for Nada.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards from women in mourning are meant to help prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women, whose loved ones committed suicide, try to distract others from the intention of taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put postcards with inspirational messages and phone numbers on the Welsh Bridge, under which people can get help.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he was diagnosed with depression, and he took his own life at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she says.
45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a well-advised chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
They always said that he could brighten up every room.”
Before he died, however, he quit his job because he was “in a really black place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother was 11 years old, and it was he who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the domino effect."
Sharon Davis has created cards to “tell people that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if they’re just friends.
Don’t sit still, talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, soon after her mother’s death, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark.
“He didn’t say anything about feeling stuck, sad, or anything,” he says.
“A few days before God’s birth, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas he was already in a complete pit. When the children opened the presents, he even looked at them.”
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “It breaks a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in Italy as FBI initiates investigation
“I thought that if we could actually get what he was asking for — a time-limited and limited-range investigation — maybe we could achieve some unanimity,” Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of the committee’s failure.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
All their dissatisfaction comes from the moment.
Elections to Congress are already in a few weeks — November 6th. If, according to forecasts, Republicans lose them, the chances of choosing a particular person to the highest court in the country will significantly decrease.
George W. Bush had already raised his earphones to call senators and encourage them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him at the White House and by him met his wife Ashley, who was the president’s personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is unclear if Brett Kavanaugh will get at least 50 senators, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the impasse and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's rule, the number of North Korean refugees is shrinking
According to South Korean lawmaker Kim Jong Un, who took power seven years ago, the number of people fleeing from North Korea to South Korea has fallen.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of the United Nations, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 escapes last year, and in 2011 — 2,706.
According to him, the key factors that have affected this situation are more precise border controls between North Korea and China, and higher rates charged by human smugglers.
Pjongjang has not issued a public statement on this matter.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea are ultimately proposed as citizens of South Korea.
According to authorities in Seoul since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most of them are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross it than a strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly sends them back to the country.
Relations between the North and the South, which are theoretically still in a state of war, have clearly improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, where they held talks on denuclearization negotiations, which had previously come to a dead end.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Dzong Unem, which took place in June in Singapore. The result of this meeting is a general agreement aimed at clearing the Korean Peninsula with weapons.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of not making progress on the issue.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty as to our national security, and in these circumstances there is no possibility that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first,” Ri said in a speech he made before the General Assembly.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh a "hysterical" and said that he was by nature unfit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said these words during an interview she gave on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
“I think if a woman behaved that way, she would be considered ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh made Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At times, during his opening speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions—almost screaming and losing his voice when discussing family issues and high school years.
He also explicitly angered Democrats on the committee, citing allegations of "grotesque and coordinated attempt at a reputation" organized by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court because it revealed his bias towards the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself by making these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Asked if she would seek to remove Kavanaugh from office if he received the nomination and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"I will say so: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also serve in that court where he is currently working," she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade process because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearing confirming Kavanaugh, he avoided the question of whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time to bring a hysterical, prejudiced person to court who will expect us to say 'but it's wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to master it.
It's the right diatribe, months and years of raging fury, and she can't throw it away without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Gloria Steine told me 45 years later.
“That’s quite common, isn’t it?”
She added: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was the manager of a company. She said that she was also crying when she was angry, but she came up with a way that when she gets nervous and starts crying, she says to the person she’s talking to, ‘Pe’s talking to.
I'm angry.
And he continues to do his own thing.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are permissible as an outlet of anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories of one of the first positions in the men-dominated office is how one day I started to cry with an unspoken rage. An older woman — a cool conductor — is running out of control, and I’m always getting tired of it.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad, and they’re happy that you’ve been cared for.”
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a member of Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a boat lover named Monkey Business and pulled out of the race, frustrated at Patricia's boundaries, she realized that she could actually consider running for president.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone described the situation as 'The Snow Queen and the Seven Wonders'.
As the campaign has been going on for a long time, Schroeder has been reliant on fundraising and has vowed not to enter the race if it doesn’t raise $2 million.
It was a battle doomed to defeat.
She discovered then that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1,000, only had 250 for her.
"Do they think I have any discounts?" she wondered.
During the speech, in which she announced that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotions — gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and turn to the voters, and to turn to the voters.
“You might think I’ve gone through a nervous breakdown,” the press reports.
“You might think I’m being sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my grave.
"Did she cry?"
What are the benefits of Beijing’s economic war between the United States and China?
The salvos that started the economic war between the US and China were horrendous and although the battle is still ongoing, in the longer term the conflict between these countries may be beneficial for Beijing, experts say.
The first warning this year was fired by U.S. President Donald Trump, imposing tariffs on China’s key export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week after the introduction of new tariffs on $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, which taxed half of all U.S. goods from China.
Each time, Beijing has reciprocated in nature, recently raising tariffs on U.S. goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to any U.S. strike, and it does not appear that the world’s second economy is about to step down.
“Washington’s forced withdrawal means accepting demands, but public tilting of the head to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
According to experts, however, if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure from the U.S. trade war could in the long run strengthen China, reducing dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision made in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for the economic chaos in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers have so far conceded to the American Center,” said Dr. Azkaz.
Syria's foreign minister says it is "ready" for refugees to return
The government says Syria is ready for a voluntary return of refugees, and calls for help in rebuilding a devastated country as a result of more than seven years of war.
In his speech before the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country were improving.
“The situation in our territory is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
In an effort to restore normality, the government is constantly rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists.
All the conditions have already been met so that refugees who had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic movements aimed at their daily lives and means of subsistence can voluntarily return to it.
According to UN estimates, since the beginning of the war in 2011, Syria has left more than 5.5 million citizens.
An additional six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept aid under the conditions or offered by countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team by 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris.
The United States has lost the Ryder Cup for the sixth time in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when under the leadership of the Danish captain, Thomas Bjorn, scored 14.5 points, which were needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who for most of the tournament did not go well, hit the ball from the base straight into the water at the 16th hole of PAR3, giving the same game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone through all the rounds and became one of the four players who, since 1979, when this tournament first took place in the current format, managed to score 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated 5&4 by the lowest ranked player from Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the top spot in the world rankings, has lost two goals to England's last goal against England's Ian Poulter, for whom it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
The European with the most wins in the Ryder Cup was Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who has already taken part in eight such tournaments and scored 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t stop.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he believed in me and chose me.
I am very happy to get the cup back.
It's the success of the whole team and I'm glad I could help," Garcia said after the team's win from Europe.
He gives a thumbs up to his cousin, John Rahm, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday in a single-game game, 2&1.
“I’m incredibly proud of Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching his game,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 result in the Ryder Cup.
It’s an unsurprising statistic, like one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and only outscored Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding the ball throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fina, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of the American team's captain, Jim Furyk, said: "I'm proud of the boys, they fought.
At one point this morning we pressed a few Europeans.
We retreated.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will change the composition of the group. Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of admiration for my opponents.
They played a lot better than us.”
