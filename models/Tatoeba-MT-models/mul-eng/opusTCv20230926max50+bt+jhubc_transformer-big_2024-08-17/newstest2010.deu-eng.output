Barack Obama is the fourth U.S. President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a check of over $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House will arrive tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the north-western metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The couple then planned a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its climax with the ceremony where Obama takes over the prestigious award.
He received the award as the fourth U.S. president, but only as the third to receive the award directly in office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when the price is taken over.
The president does not want to shy away from this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
He reinforced the war efforts a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gold medal, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish kroner (about 24 million Czech kroner).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event programme will then include a banquet with the President and his wife, in which the Prime Minister and another 250 guests will be present in addition to Norway’s King and Queen.
From the very beginning, Obama was very reluctant about the price.
He suggested, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve the prize.
He also repeated several times that the price is not just for him, but for everyone who aspires to the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this is a "call to action" for him.
Naturalists are accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the president of the civic association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" for blackmail.
In several cases, he filed appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals, he asked investors for money in his favor, said Leitmeritz police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
Chairman of the Leitmeritz Nature Conservation Community, Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he is in prison and it threatens him with a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sortier mill containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague people can sort the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages you will find the sortier mill containers step by step.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate tonnage.
I do not want to argue that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Councillors do not care enough about this problem, even though we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Br<0xC3><0xBC>nn is in the waste racing in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers here, but mainly due to the number of tons of waste for such waste.
Have you ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket, for example?
This is just art, above all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I've found so far by chance is the swamp square opposite the hit Gans.
Mr Onderka and his colleagues should not be upset, but I think that is too little.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is not a honey slick in other parts as well.
That’s why I don’t like to sort all my friends’ garbage.
Out of Fault.
It is too far away from the garbage.
I'm not surprised.
Even after the celebration, I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on Konicova Street, I didn’t see a ton of color garbage in sight.
Fortunately, I got to the right place when I was on the tram.
The trash almost ran out.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn’t it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Br<0xC3><0xBC>ner Socialists cold.
You’d rather buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us all over the republic, rather than buying a few more tons of trash and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner tan.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance even with official statistics after I searched the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno really is the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has taken away the money for pensions and sick money
After the left party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government’s view, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, sick money and construction savings.
But also not for the state debt or for the international legal dispute.
This is causing them even more problems that will be in the government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists implemented the wage increase for some groups, they expected the government to pay the money for sensitive spending, retirement or sick money in addition. “This is just a postponement of the problems into the future, mining,” says Janota.
Of the loans, relatively higher interest rates are being paid, and you have to refund the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, where to take, the state box is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state operation are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the left now gave more money: the fire department, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for their children.
In order for the pensions or sick money from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people need not be afraid, they get that money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more – next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state treasury, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will increase more and more quickly, and along with it the costs and interest.
The state will need the money for the compensation, then it will no longer be enough to increase the VAT only slightly or to reduce the maternity money, as the government did in its counterfeit package.
Due to the money-laundering in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will be missing next year for the expansion of highways and railways.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be re-designed and possibly billed.
At the very least, get what is not free.
This means the delay or the hiring of thirty large buildings, Europe’s money creation is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solves the drain of money Solomonically - it attacks the CEZ shareholders in which the state owns the majority, and from these the money is then distributed into the traffic funds.
The problem is that the height of the dividend is never certain and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion of CEZ went into the budget.
Annually, dividends are paid for the environmental damage liquidation, the pension account is replenished and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, according to EU rules, the actual budget deficit rises to the level of 5.7 percent of GDP.
The carnival of the revolutions is not over yet.
Almost three billion fell the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes or for expenses for litigation, even for building savings.
Whether the state can get along without this money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international lawsuit, then we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes clear.
The minister then has to save the money abroad or, in the worst case, attack the government's budget reserves.
One hundred million are also missing for the already started two-billion-dollar project "State Treasury", which is supposed to allow on-line monitoring, for which the individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions will come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
Americans expect the future with a mobile phone where users can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to press only one button, and from Windows Mobile it will be switched to Android within a few seconds.
This is precisely the opportunity the American company VMware wants to present, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles at the same time on your phone.
You can switch between these, you can split them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and premiered a few days ago for the first time.
It will be available on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully passed the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalist.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM, on which the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems ran simultaneously.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization, and the devices are expected to arrive to the customer by 2012.
Snowfall on the mountains torments hotel owners
Scneelose slopes do not only worry the Giant Bear inhabitants.
The lack of snow also scares people away from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That’s why you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year’s Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but in the meantime they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year’s Christmas festival will be on snow or “on mat,” the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, said.
Those who want the New Year’s Eve stay in the Spindelm<0xC3><0xBC>hle exactly according to their ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
Those who prefer to save and where the quality of the stay comes first in second place, who can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelm<0xC3><0xBC>hle hotel owners now only offer weekly stays for the New Year’s Eve.
I think they will try to sell these for a while, but then they will have to give up and enter shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, Jandura estimated.
Free beds at all winter appointments are always offered by the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert, introduced.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer Christmas Eve in the Giant Mountains, but there are less free places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and slightly better than last year, we managed to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year’s Eve and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
Up to 80 percent of the New Year’s Eve stays are occupied by the Hotel Omnia at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free for Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
We were pleasantly surprised this year in January, for which we are already about 60 percent occupied.
A little weaker is now February, but the moment when the snow comes, the interest in staying in the Giant Mountains will surely increase, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, said.
The giant mountain hotel owners are now waiting for a greater snow saving.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it comes to precipitation, it should be snowing on the mountains.
But after that there will be another warm-up, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
America: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It’s almost funny how student aspiration Barack Obama, the president with his call of the wisest, repeats his predecessor’s strategy in the Afghanistan question that he himself considered the dumbest.
Finally, when he sweated out his desperation-expected Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had copied it from the Bush-Iraq scenario three years earlier.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text himself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New way forward" without hesitation.
Even three years ago, he criticized the Bush idea – fresh troop quotas to be sent to Iraq, which was plagued by the civil war – as “irresponsible and in its consequences a carastrophic decision.”
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on the recommendations of the military, was the only possible and to the extent that it was very successful that there was no talk in the news about Iraq today at all.
Bush’s reputation was not improved by this, for objectively he left his successor with a much more grateful starting situation than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
He was once again asked by the military, especially by the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordination habits, even harshly criticized the shady gunmen in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea and so he cheated the general on 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the pledge for another 5,000, even though he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
Most problematic of the entire Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in as little as 18 months, and to complete this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half-assed uprising will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the fraternal war of recent years, Iraq society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the contraindication - no one can rely on anyone and no agreements will be made.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally founded correctly, remain only seeming structures behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balancing of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the opaque nature of the conditions that further complicate the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
It is also very unrealistic to establish a "acting state", which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy alienated by its volunteerism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened further and is now on the brink of an explosion.
They believe that the little soldiers who have broken into the war cry about the "early return" create a miracle here can only create a truly romantic soul that is not impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, the date setting for the troop withdrawal is purely irresponsible, because the Taliban will take this as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is declining.
Europe’s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their constituents how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hindu Kush mountainous region.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
Should the situation continue to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, a very serious question arises for the United States whether the problem should not be solved with troops.
This question has to be answered in the period when America steps up to Obama to withdraw from Afghanistan.
However, any solution will also mean a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that three more years remain until the presidential election, and so there is still enough time for him to resort to another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
The managers of Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive bonus bonuses in bar
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which reacts to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of the money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers in the event that they act excessively risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to link Wall Street’s premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, led by the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after laying aside nearly $17 billion for bonus bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonus bonuses over the course of this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, according to Reuters, despite the measure shown today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political topic since the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
The UK reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the banker’s bonuses, which exceed <0xC2><0xA3>25,000, once with a 50 percent tax.
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Today in Stockholm, five women from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf have taken over this year’s Nobel Prizes in the specialist categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, was among them.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her compatriot Jack Szostak, have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for research in the field of chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for the clarification of the ribosome structure and function.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
This award was presented today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the fiberglass field and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these laureates has received the diploma, the Nobel Prize and a certificate of the acquisition of the prize.
There are 10 million Swedish kroner in each category.
If there are multiple prize winners in each category, the prize money will be divided among them.
According to tradition, the US President, Barack Obama, has received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his path, and also stands at the top of the country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policies, however, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations to fight world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus has invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives the finance minister, Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in the government on Friday morning because he does not agree with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form it was released by the Parliamentary Assembly on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget, and perhaps the stay of Janota in the cabinet, will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the state deficit is too high, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president’s spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday about his further stay in office.
According to the Budget Act, which Klaus now receives for signature, the Czech Republic should be operating with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
In Parliament, however, on Wednesday, the Left Party’s proposals for money-laundering were voted on and the money raised for civil servants, for the maintenance of social services and direct wages of farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of Social Democracy that it covertly increase the budget deficit.
On the one hand, and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party, on the other, a sharp internal political dispute arose, hence the question mark about the further work of the Fischer official cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party took shape.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of austerity measures implemented by the fishermen’s government in the fall, and that it is intended to end the government’s debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but doesn’t have to, said today at breakfast discussions with entrepreneurs that politicians have been neglecting the “serious problem” that represents the “unsustainable deficit” of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only lead to a strong government, which could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is gruesome, and the government should consider its continued existence.
The chairman of the ODS, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words in the editorial board as "strong statements".
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the state deficit is gruesome, that the former government had prepared Topolanek for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
As early as Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People’s Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman.
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows much of the country, of its struggle and victories despite some criticism that the main role was played by an American actor.
The story tells the story of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, portrays in his life the American Oscar-winning actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-year-old Mandela if he could portray him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon takes on another important role.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I'm going to have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing section "Million Dollar Baby", was already the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, from which he eventually became a slaveholder, but also a fictitious U.S. president, and so many others.
The former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his active work in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who belong to the outside world.
Finally, the South African team climbs up to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela’s story to the screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to bring it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actor said if he and the world politician were to be in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, eat dinner with him at night, and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela’s hand.
I’ve noticed when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it’s transmitted, and I felt like I know what you’re feeling, he said.
For me, it’s important to be a different person.
Matt Damon portrays Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard-fought world of rugby.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I sounded at the doorbell that it opened and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, ‘In the movie I look much bigger.’
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and there is also talk of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety magazine, Todd McCarthy, summed up his evaluation in the following words: "It was a very good story, a very well-executed film."
In the film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive reviews.
Light mystery over Norway: The Russians have tested a missile
A special light effect on Norway was to be observed of unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defense only admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was not successful again and the missile, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of Russian generality as well as the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence on site in the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not started at all or has been damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers one writes about "Bulava" as a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but lights
This was the 13th attempt, which was normal in the beginning.
Technical damage to the rocket occurred only at the end of the flight.
The engine probably exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time, "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which ran under the water of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indeterminate flying object over northern roads was actually the damaged "Bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians have not hesitated since the first moment that it is a Russian missile.
The generality has defended itself this time against this and claims that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage were immediately damaged.
Even if no test start was made without a mistake, the head of the Ministry of Defense considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism and so it is maintained that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51.
The legendary defender Vjace<0xC5><0xA1>lav Fetisov again presents himself in a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former World Champion, Olympian and Stanley Cup owner is helping his team CSKA Moscow in need, and is likely to start in the Friday match KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kulja’s injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining formalities, the AP agency quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is unclear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will affect only one game.
I mean that Fetishov is one of those who can raise the morale of other co-players, co-player Nemcinov performed.
When Fetisov comes back on the ice, he will become the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game, according to AP.
In the NHL, legendary stormer Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one and was able to score 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships and he also triumphed in the Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second half of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup over his head in the Detroit Dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room.
Hyundai handed over to the unions. All overtime will be cancelled
The management of the Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the union to cancel all overtime.
Due to frequently scheduled overtime, the union announced its readiness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday layer this week.
We must not give up our production schedule, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, volunteer overtime was proposed for the reason that two working layers would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work the Saturday layer.
The employees will also receive it in the aftermath for the Saturday layer from November 28.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime surcharge or they can take a replacement holiday on December 28 to extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday layer will be paid the fare and lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and burning point in terms of demands and complaints from trade unions that had halted production last week, the management yesterday afternoon with immediate effect decided on the abolition of all overtime for the month of December.
The employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift until last week.
Upon signature of the agreement, the strike readiness on the part of the trade unions will be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unions are expected to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to lift the strike.
The situation in the automobile factory peaked last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment terms and alleged scandals.
The management, on the other hand, insisted that employees have to make the overtime to meet the automotive supply needs.
The unionists also demanded in their Monday strike readiness statement that the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday would not be subject to sanctions.
In the area of overtime, trade unions are calling for a minimum reduction in overtime work.
In addition, this year they are demanding to pay the fee of 5000 kroner.
Hyundai’s Nosovice automobile factory now employs 2,000 people.
Serial production started at the company in November last year.
As of this September, approximately 80,000 vehicles have been produced here, the current production capacity being 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in ‘stealed’ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works in viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact prevails against the disadvantage that the connection to common virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the already existing drugs.
The disease AIDS cannot yet be cured.
However, the patient can prolong the composition of the drug and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of viral proliferation has also resulted in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which no drugs are any longer effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague as well as from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with the virus resistance.
They have proven that the substances referred to as metallocarborates have an effect on the protein that is responsible for increasing the HIV virus.
The metal carbonates are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus proliferation in a different way than all the drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new ‘improved’ compounds, which have been prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
The metal carboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multiplicity cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Home-made and persistent virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus cleavage caused by the HIV protease, no mature infectious virus particles would emerge.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the virus’s proliferation in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper, which was published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which are then systematically changed further.
Something weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV proteases is tested in the reagent glass, also against their persistent (resistant) variants, which were obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metallocarborane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its further properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formations, makes the metal carbonates interesting compounds for further research on the development of effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Head of the Institute of Organic Chemistry, Pavlina Bizacova.
Dispute over budget. ODS went to Fisher, who refuses
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as "gray" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, in his opinion, consider its continued existence.
The statement of the ODS referred to the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
It is believed that there is time for analysis.
The deputy chairman of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the SDGs and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
Parliament adopted the budget for 2010 on Wednesday, but with left-wing amendments worth more than SEK 12 billion.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should be able to manage with a balance of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, so it has complied with the request of the government, because the amended budget is also only a less bad variant of the budget provisional.
Disappointment and meaninglessness
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his disappointment and a sense of meaninglessness, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer has said that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota were seriously threatened with his resignation in the event that the amendment proposals would be adopted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota has signed up with the Prime Minister for Monday after the government deal.
He has indicated that he is considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment about the negotiation of the budget.
As far as Fischer is concerned for the further struggle with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominees of Social Democracy (CSSD), who had implemented the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will step down if parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sickness and pensions or the service bill.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS are not mistaken
This is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek stressed in a text message from the US.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function are people who profess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to waive the fight against the deficit levels of public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that he relies on the left-wing majority currently in parliament."
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the bourgeois democrats.
I did not think about it, and if that is the case, then I will deal with it,” Martin Bartak, the defence minister nominated by the Democrats, told reporters in parliament.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for the European Council meeting.
The ODS returned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the SDGs would probably vote against the amended budget in parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister explicitly asked the MPs of the Democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not appear as orphans, we are not small children, so he then responded to the question whether the SDGs were not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn’t realize my voice was missing.
Even when I gave up the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevikisation of Parliament and the destruction of the country, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will run for about the same fare.
The Czech Railway will terminate or limit some less-exhausted express and local trains from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by 2 percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares incl. base and customer fare are not changed.
Several connections to the capital receive, for example, the residents of the Ostrava area, the railway uses trains of the Pendolino type for this route.
The fast train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Fewer express trains will also run on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle, the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The biggest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (K<0xC3><0xB6>nigsgraz), a total of eight per cent, on the other hand, can look forward to an increase in Prague and its surroundings.
Two night trains are also cancelled on the route Prague - Tabor - Budweis and on a few days a week the operation of some express trains on the route Prague - Pisak - Budweis is reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to cross in Lysa nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth traffic route of the suburban transport system Esko, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava, and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run within two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers have been unable to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year’s bill for regional railways: 200 million increase
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total the railway will receive four billion kroner in order to compensate for the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, just as in this year. The local trains will supply the districts, in total they will pay three thousand kroner for it in the next year.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the express trains, the railway has re-signed a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded only for one year.
The railway praised the system, perhaps that’s why it didn’t take the price increase for the vast majority of tickets.
Changes can only be made with one-day CD Net and cheap eLiska internet tickets.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of CD Net is increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the driveway, until now it was uniform for the trip between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine Militants arrest more than 50 people, the children were released.
Militants abducted 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including some primary school students and their teachers.
This was led by the AFP agency, which originally reported only about 65 kidnappings.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 militants allegedly used the hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
The local negotiators are now working to release the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armistice of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, 57 people were killed in the recent massacre.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which coincided with the election to the governor’s office, were 30 journalists.
Suspected of participating in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
On Tuesday, however, peace talks with the Philippine government resumed.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, Clint Eastwood’s new Hollywood film comes to the American cinemas “Invictus: The Unbeaten,” which includes part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who had been chosen by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African rugby champion, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
With the film's cinematic style, reactions from critics as well as the public are also heard.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, then in 1993 together with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it comes to the cinemas at a time when South Africa, on the one hand, is culminating in preparations for the World Cup, but at the same time the media is bringing the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants of the Blacks.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are positive for the first time, despite numerous reservations against the cast of the lead roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film, however.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared well for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela several times in person so that I can, as they say, receive his energy, he performed in an interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good to be able to reach out to Mandela’s personality and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects every person, he added.
In the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin, loosely translated ‘In the Role of the Enemy’: Nelson Mandela and the game that unites the people portrays the South African human rights defender within his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman strives throughout the film to bring together two racial and interdependent population groups year-on-day, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also appears in his role in the South African National Rugby Dress on the World Cup field, which South Africa won at the time.
For the entrance of the lawn in the dress, which is considered almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white public and has thus won the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may lead to the reunification of the people into a single people, led by rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve will only show itself.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, as revealed in a recent interview with LN of rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to the UK.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million kroner
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switching plant near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the district fire service Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units were involved in the fire.
Initially, the fire department wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed its view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special solvents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the security operation of the management system, according to the company spokeswoman, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage has been estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will be identified only after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandatova.
For over 10 years, nothing similar has happened with the company Ceps, errors of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted by the fire of the transformer station, according to the spokesman of CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova. The functioning of households, authorities and companies was not affected by the fire.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as a sole operator of the wiring system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovated and develops 39 switchgear systems with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred into distribution system and line track with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura raises criminal record for defamation against three CSSD leaders.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises criminal charges for slandering three social democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The lawsuit is related to the company’s effort to operate regional train traffic in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, while we have only submitted the offer over the scale as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railway because we would know the prices of the Czech Railway that were completed last week.
There is nothing left for us but to defend ourselves.
Because of this defamation of the company Student Agency, Jancura told the radiojournal.
At the same time, he argued that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of the criminal record for the continuation of Jancura’s media show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also urge other leaders to do so.
I assume that it will also become clear in this matter that it is Jancura, who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses false and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he has invested several million kroons in advertising, which will point to the adverse step of the districts.
He told the radio that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas, and he wants to continue it after New Year.
He clarified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign launched Jancura after the districts agreed to operate regional rail transport with the Czech Railway and had not issued tenders for the contract in a high of 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, he was also threatened, according to Jancura, by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn’t give up on the fact that we could lose the bus licenses, too.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, Jancura told the radio newspaper today.
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease free of charge and voluntary
Impeachment against pneumococcus changes the habit from January.
It should be free and voluntary for families first.
But already now, voices are reporting that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcus culminate.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which the health insurance companies have to pay.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New Vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January onwards, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcus, which was born on August 2 of last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccine dose.
Anyone who has already started vaccination in the past year or earlier must also pay for further revaccination themselves.
The first vaccine dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child's life.
As early as last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal pneumonia.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for one dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children, four doses are required.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance for the vaccine doses spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year.
However, they save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all children's surface vaccinations.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus causes central inflammation, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
Due to pneumococcal infections, up to 28 children under the age of 10 die every year after being examined in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococcal pneumonia was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January, it will be paid for by the insurance companies and will be voluntary.
For example, the head of the Nahlas civic association, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that the compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association promotes long-term pneumococcal vaccination.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very happy with the fact that we had a voluntary vaccination.
That's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have succeeded in doing so at least.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcus.
At this moment we do not consider this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, the doctors claim.
The chairman of the specialist society of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think about reducing the number of repeat vaccinations “In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a volunteer,” says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their babies vaccinated against pneumococcus by next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcus is also groundbreaking in that it is paid for as the first surface vaccination by health insurance companies and not by the state.
The insurances should spend the money on prevention, saving them for further treatment, Cabrnochova said.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This, however, is a concern of the practical pediatricians involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurers and the doctors will then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
However, some MPs feared that the insurances could "run the money out of the health insurance manager".
That’s why doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for the insurance companies to pay them.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This is not going to be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. Artist Son Participates in "Museum Stealing"
The son of famed American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
According to Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught in his vehicle with a trailer when he invited 90 paintings.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man had used a excavator to penetrate the museum into the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
As the Associated Press reported, the artist stood up at the time of the incident in Florida.
The AP cited an unnamed police officer who said Frank Frazetta Junior might have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum with all means necessary to bring all the paintings into a warehouse".
The agency said Frank Frazetta Senior was arguing that he had granted permission to do so.
Labour defends state and tax increases
The ministers have defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling would have had an opportunity to “disappear” to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by delaying the decisions until after the election.
The Treasurer was also fired for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 per cent increase in social security and a 1 per cent cap on public wage deductions for 2011.
Social-insurance companies
The unions, on the other hand, have protested that low-wage recipients are being punished for a recession that they did not cause and warned of upcoming “problems.”
The rise in social security – to around <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year – has angered the private sector, which says it is a job tax, although the focus should be on economic upswing.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
WORKING POINTS OF THE PRESIDENT’S ESTABLISHMENT
Increase in social security by another 0.5% as of April 2011
This year the economy shrinks by more than the expected 4.75 %
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1 Percent Increase in Corporate Tax for Small Businesses Rejected
Tax deductions for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in government pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Treasury, someone with an annual income of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will be <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year poorer and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 per year will be <0xC2><0xA3>190 poorer, while a person with <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 annual income will be <0xC2><0xA3>110 richer.
The ministers said their target of deficit recovery by 2013 meant "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional tax burden would be borne by the top 5% of the top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms disputes that the outlined tax increases and spending cuts compared to the necessary measures would be “a drop on the hot stone.”
"These are big numbers, they're going to bring us the deficit halving, and this is also absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party’s predictions of future economic growth – which will affect the extent of the new debt and the rate of deficits – were questioned after the treasurer was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his opinion, the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year – far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while the debt would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion higher than previously forecast.
"The missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour's "debt crisis", said the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion debt over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that the ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to repay this and push themselves "cynic" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place by June 2010 at the latest.
“They didn’t say anything of importance about what they’re going to do,” said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. “They had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass.”
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police be protected from future cuts, unlike in the Conservatives’ proposals, which see deficit capping come faster and more likely.
But the Liberal Democrats said the money won by the tax increases and spending cuts will be used to cover spending for next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are “built on sand.”
The BBC’s political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements – such as the above inflation adjustment for some disabled pensioners next April – some would expose the treasurer to the charge of capturing the vote, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra assistance when people need it most and that the situation is re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler State"
Although the ministers have not announced state details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only come to bear in the medium term.
The recognized Institute for Tax Investigations said that the Treasurer’s figures would mean strong deductions in many areas, possibly in the future also in the areas of transportation, higher education, science and defense.
“It only shifts the pain to later,” said his manager Robert Chote.
“The significant announcements are only made after the election, whoever wins them,” added Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to Deloitte’s audit firm.
"This was just the hollow pre-state report, and the markets recognize that."
FBI Investigates “Crimes of U.S. Citizens in Pakistan”
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an attack on a house in Sarghoda, eastern Punjab province, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether the same men who were reported missing in the U.S. state of Virginia last month were being reported missing.
The U.S. State Department said it was also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
“If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges that are being brought against them and under what circumstances they will be detained,” Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed of the arrests and was in touch with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are actually the missing students,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had already taken an interest in the house earlier and that no charges have yet been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that it rejected Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from commenting on the arrests, but said the United States "must work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by their families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns 'abuse' in Iran
According to a report by Amnesty International, human rights in Iran is still as bad as it has been in the past 20 years.
The report details "misuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man, quoted in the report, said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected earlier criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
Following the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of those arrested and prosecutors said at least five people had been sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak prison.
But since then, there has been no longer any tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International cited the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
"They hit me in the face more often," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and became, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, Amnesty said.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also called the case of a former inmate who said he had been detained with 75 others more than eight weeks in a container at a detention facility in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary had set up a committee to investigate the unrest following the election and the government’s reactions to it, but so Amnesty, the mandate and power of these bodies would be unclear and the results won by the parliamentary committees would not have been obtained.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski hang has been set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a racetrack.
The ski slopes of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump chance at the beginning of a 100-meter-long slope.
Student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite scary.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that glisten below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talent."
Prizes were awarded for the best performing pieces of art on the hang - or tricks.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to melt.
Still she and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted for a ban on mining and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-thought-out report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe’s most integrative and secularized societies.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's latest work: "Why the French don't love towels" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely-arguing study of a contentious issue that is also haunting the country for over a decade and a half.
Bowen’s newest book offers a more comprehensive and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools, and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as it is called by Bowen “Islamic Freedoms”.
He is a good listener, he gives back debates between teachers and students about the issues they worry the most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, which make up daily life, quite unlike the political dramas that the media is dealing with.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
You do not have all the arguments on your side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who questioned Bowen are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts – advocates of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite who guard so passionately the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may have experienced a harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn had to make their historical compromise with secular republicanism.
Rather, he sees an “enhancement of value screws” as a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The Most Unfortunate View of the World
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes it melts with alarming speed and takes life with it, which can survive nowhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have gone into the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Wandering through the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter with an ice bear as a brave 14-year-old ferryman to the lake, fighting only with the gunpowder of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have a millionth of the life span of a wildly living age. The climate is rarely suitable: The polar bear in Singapore has become quite green from the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the accounts of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat posed by hunters for the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, landing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor-sledges-riding Inuit use powerful assault rifles to bring their prey to the track.
Ironically, the ice will last the longest in the waters north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future could evolve.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
This is not due to a lack of explanation.
The pioneering voyages of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries led to the confusion of the package for the first time.
Undersea boats in the Cold War measured the shifting grate of the undersea.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale deployment of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by unafraid people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater inlets that are compressed when frozen.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened once the summer ice passes, which is expected in the period between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, that could be us.”
Marines were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths in Arlington.
The topless De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they have stepped.
“In a few months, wherever we are brought back from, we could be,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd wish someone did the same for me, so I'm trying to show that respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and a few others decided to decorate several hundred tombs at Arlington Cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip every year, stop in different cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has expanded the event to other states as well.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at the tombs at Arlington Cemetery, in areas on the Pentagon, at the tombs of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back something to the victims.
She said this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It’s like visiting a family cemetery.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older tombs from World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War as a target, as they were not visited as often as the newer ones, the organizers said.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held hands as they carried the fresh pine branches to the greying gravestones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the top.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mostly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the dark mood of the current wars filled this area.
Some cried out, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the icy air.
Some read the names carved in stone before, while others bowed down to small black and white place cards, which had been inserted into the damp mud, whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son’s grave.
She is driven 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marine Infrared Officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free... my son paid for it, she said.
“If I’m not here for a long time, I want someone to remember me.”
U.S. Government Contractors Arrested by Cuban Authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and laptops in the country, foreign ministry officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
U.S. consular officials in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner, who was arrested on December 5.
The special indictments have not yet been published, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the charge of “danger”.
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Governmentally hostile graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogging community led by popular reporter Yoani S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being stalked and attacked by government officials.
S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro brothers’ communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which sought a “slow” approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that the United States will be compensated if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desirable products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are mainly used to send text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet usage on the island is extremely limited.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are sitting behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, a spokeswoman for the U.S. interest agency in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the release of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", who recently filed a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, same Cuba"
Vivanco said the defendants would be arrested, convicted and imprisoned very often within a day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries moved on for more dialogue readiness.
Pakistani Government Officials Cover Plan to Send Men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday discovered a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy that aimed to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said they hoped this case could help a wider network of terrorist contenders to snatch off the Internet.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgency, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he found them out because one of them had made comments about terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is home to Al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan’s intelligence service, who was briefed on the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the uninhabited mountains in the northwest that have become a terrorist refuge.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That’s why they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations in order to gain access to the Al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men – who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI – underscores the crucial role of applicants in identifying future terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. Secret Service has made it a matter of utmost urgency to host human asset posts within Al-Qaeda.
The applicants of the organization act as porters who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
U.S. would-be recruits are being subjected to a special test by A. Kaida, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be incredibly attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that in recent years, terrorist groups have also become much more cautious about who they allow access to because U.S. intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to get someone into these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, Kohlmann said.
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters call for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded from the negotiators at the city’s Bella Convention Center to act bravely on climate protection.
Protesters said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more than 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists set fire to small explosives near some government buildings in the downtown area.
One day, when little happened at the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists marched with transparency through the city, where in English, “There is no planet B” and one in Spanish, which declared “The Earth says “Enough”.
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that trips to Peru, her mother’s country of birth, make her aware of what heartbreaking problems the country has to contend with due to the already perceptible effects of climate change.
That’s part of the reason why I have decided to participate in the big demonstration – to go ahead and appeal to the world leaders to make a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It’s not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there’s no other way around it.
The police stopped the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or carrying handcuffs.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked protesters in black clothes set off several explosives near the Copenhagen main channel, where several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as light rockets, but then were followed by "a few big explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of the TV screens to follow the demonstration throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to have reached the consciousness of key officials, such as Su-wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of at all".
He then went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He found that it depends on the individual’s perspective on whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “it can also be said that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people.”
Test data show stubborn race air <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The math performance certificates were last week welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the country’s schools producing the highest performance, evidence shows that the fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress in the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American counterparts rose by only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance air actually increased from 53 points to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African-American eighth graders remained essentially the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data, as the sample scope was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The gap that separated the white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points reached by children in both groups has grown over this time period, the difference has now barely decreased by 58 points.
Some district education advocates expressed their concern last week that the results celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were pushed forward, for the most part by white students, who are already powerful children anyway.
This suggests that we have raised the overall score by treating those at the top end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates educational equality in Washington, D.C.
“I’m not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points,” said Democratic Washington City Councilman Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of exam scores is that the city’s high schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What scares me, though, is that we don’t spend the time and energy we need to spend on our high school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the underperforming students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary school, which basic reading skills did not master at the beginning of their schooling, and the ones lying behind their clarinet significantly.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games and life-like experiences from kindergarten to sixth grade, was brought to Washington under former school principal Clifford Janey and this curriculum will be written down some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I mean, we still have to work on making the best measures available to students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system, while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the weak schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, who is investigating urban test results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington, D.C.
The objective could have political repercussions that are working against this important agenda item.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that they try to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighbourhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public schooling.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements of closing the service air is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington to compete with charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers union last year over 185 days a year, which he considered a “milestone” on the way to a bigger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than the outlook for the future
The tour bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, steps out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela’s parents have barely completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who had been bailed out in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the group’s other eighth graders, who explore Gettysburg, where the tuition costs $38,690 a year, was more that of an avid visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I'll be here soon!" cried Graciela, who likes to study medicine, when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told of the school's low professor-to-student ratio.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have completely embraced the intended message: The question is not whether you go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the US of Hispanic immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands who receive the college education necessary to get into the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second generation” Hispanic Americans closes the college – which is a remarkable achievement since many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having graduated from high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workforce.
Those who study powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for the school and an inherent drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, especially if these efforts continue for a long time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure at some point will not solve the problem either, said Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis who studied Hispanic students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal program, funded by Graciela’s college tour, is a useful example.
It’s known as GEAR UP—a one-way upturn—and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to start college preparatory programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they graduate from high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have attended college.
Iraq’s Ministry of Oil concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government, at two auctions on Saturday, has been able to cause larger oil companies to rebuild their damaged infrastructure.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi oil ministry show that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies were only able to book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has pulled the shorter ones.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly-seeded representatives of American oil giants at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of U.S. companies Asian and European are paving the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no more offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which were still underscored by massively coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and the political instability caused by the U.S. military’s withdrawal, likely deterred U.S. oil companies, analysts said, engaging more strongly in Iraq, the world’s third-largest proven crude oil producer.
U.S. firms have been disadvantageous in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to hold shareholders accountable.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that were able to enter into contracts with the Ministry.
Major U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close relations with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been sidelined in recent years with technical advice, have gone blank.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the oil ministry spokesman, Assam Jihad, that China is on track to become one of the greats of the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure itself with its partners and will fulfill its obligations towards Iraq.
Pre-selected companies issued bids, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay to increase the emissions of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda's top planner killed in Pakistan
A top Al-Qaeda operative was reportedly killed this week in an apparent U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
This would be, if it were confirmed, the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs reportedly killed by a number of missiles, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region, who hit their vehicle near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan’s illegal tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, an official of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah said by phone.
Residents suspected of belonging to the militants rushed to the scene and quickly took in everything that was left of the “completely destroyed bodies.”
Local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism movement gave indeterminate evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia has been described as the leading military planner of al-Qaeda, which led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and referred to the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Considering its central role as given, this also included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of al-Qaeda and implemented them in operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somalia had risen rapidly in the Al-Qaeda hierarchy and maintained better links with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this does not in any way reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somalia would be the second leading al-Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September when Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other top activists were killed in a similar attack.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has dropped from an average of six operations a month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a nonprofit organization.
The decline may be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
UN envoy to Kabul to step down
The UN’s top envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would step down from his office in March, ending a stormy period of office that was overshadowed by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
Eid’s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase in troops, but also expressed concerns that the U.S. timetable for the military withdrawal, which is due to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the build-up of Afghan security forces, sending the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian helpers to assist in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign his office, but only fulfilled an agreement made in March 2008 with his family to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now moving on, so he has time to provide a replacement.
What I said is that he better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has started looking for a replacement.
The UN representatives say he has considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of preferring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential election and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has denied all charges, but he also said that Galbraith's accusations - which were fired - "has undoubtedly caused damage to the mission because there was already a large amount of skepticism regarding international interference in the election."
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the U.S.-led military’s relief efforts in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow its successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries who donate to the Afghan mission, and said this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at restricting his forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome U.N. sanctions have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, I have been able to hire only one person.
This is disastrous and must not go on like this.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran Must Expect Additional Sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose “significant additional sanctions” on Iran because it has not participated in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a seven-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in Northern Iraq and played down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good choices in Iran, he said in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such a development.
“One of the things that is on my mind is if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years that is unpredictability to the war itself.”
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package targeting Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Syrian.
He said a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer tremendously" under the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the U.S. government has joined the European top politicians in warning that Iran must expect “credible” consequences if it does not use its nuclear program to meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear-armed international organization.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said it would resume talks to limit its nuclear program and abandon a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and win time for negotiations.
But since that time, Iran seems to have abandoned negotiations on the provisional agreements -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees about whether to commit to the United States.
That Iran has simply left the international community with some proposals that they had already agreed to in early October has, frankly, brought the international community together, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way that they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set Dec. 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he will pursue other options, including those once called by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton “pressing sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian delegation condemned what it called “groundless and unfounded allegations” on Thursday by some Security Council members about Iran’s nuclear activities and said they were ready to “solve the talks with the United States and resolve a long-standing dispute with five other world powers.”
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to lower the potential for conflict to prevent delays in U.S. plans to reduce U.S. troop strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel Kurdish concerns about the upcoming troop withdrawal, and U.S. representatives quoted Gates, who told Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you.”
A change of course in China’s ageing
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that told them that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lessons have taught them so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly started to change course this summer due to the low birth rate and the aging population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their response was not immediate and definitive.
We have already invested all our time and energy into a child.
For a second child, nothing is left, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously thick, protracted single children who have lovingly been called “little emperor” have brought about a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN reports.
Department of Population Affairs is set to increase from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent of the population by 2050, far above the global average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with an educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s reported residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said couples in reproductive age need to get babies “to help reduce the proportion of older populations and alleviate the labor shortage of the future.”
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A step-by-step relaxation
Incorporated in the country’s 1978 constitution, China’s one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial provision introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy must expect huge fines - up to three times their annual salary in some regions - and discrimination in their workplace.
Chinese state officials have attributed this policy to the fact that the critical use of natural state resources could be avoided, despite human rights abuses in enforcing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who had already had a child to ejaculate.
Many couples had also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards one-child politics.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule — including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife were single children — and in 2007 the tone of many harsh slogans was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing, said government officials had recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with one partner.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines detailing who comes in for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent out city employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and to push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The response was not exactly encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outskirts of Shanghai said that a surge in requests from couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, the urban districts, on the other hand, do not report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, as an example, only four to five applications still apply per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say the expected number of births in the city for 2010 will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign — a little higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have children anymore.
They want to give their first one the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and this was also legally allowed.
But they, like many Chinese, have only a small health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply in politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples indicate psychological reasons for their hesitations.
Wang, the chief of staff, said she only wanted one child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to caring for others and we don’t really want that.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old man who owns a translation company, said it was bleeding.
For middle-aged parents with a double career that lowers the birth rate, he said, it’s about being successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The age group of today’s 20- to 39-year-olds grew up seeing their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment, and they don’t want such a life for themselves at all, he said.
Even a single child, he said, poses huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life plan -- "If the child is 9 months old, you have to have a resume ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group Designs Plan to Reduce Emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference — which has so far been characterised by wild poses and mutual accusations — has again focused on Friday with the release of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations hitting the biggest hurdles in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has revealed both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was seen as an important advance in a time-consuming negotiation, as next week more than 100 top politicians from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, formulated by a UN working group created specifically for this purpose, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can master global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit value of the global temperature rise should be, which would be contributed by policy makers.
The process will be given great flexibility, said John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to put it at the heart of what the UN’s leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, has called “the big whole.”
It shows the outline of a possible agreement in which industrial nations jointly would reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also boosted Friday’s talks by securing $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change – from mastering floods to depletion and overcrowding.
Friday, however, brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the talks over the past week.
U.S. Climate Commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations that demand mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if they are not funded by industrialized nations.
This move announced that the Obama administration is heading a tougher line with China than it was two years ago as a representative of the Bush administration.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging countries standing up and taking action, according to Stern, who also complained that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his opinion an hour after the statement of Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei, who said that the leading American climate negotiator either lacked "reason" or it was "highly irresponsible" of him that he would say the United States would not finance the United States from the beginning of the week.
As the future economic direction of the great powers of the world is at stake, there have been rifts both within the industrial nations, as well as between the industrial nations and the emerging countries.
The current struggle refers equally to the salvation of individual economies, as well as to the salvation of the planet, with China and the United States fighting for their respective obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would take on the more scientific necessity to ignore the more necessary scientific necessity.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of curbing the greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have gone so far as to aggressively push their countries to move forward with a very high level of restraint.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, according to Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although leading participants say the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, presented a 24-page draft of the agreement early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said the small island states’ offensive “ exerts political pressure on the entire political process,” in part because they are now united and call for action from emerging countries such as China and India.
The talks were given a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions still need to be clarified before the government leaders arrive to come to an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Secretary of State, have boarded their planes and rushed through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to block claims that will be negotiated over the next week.
The sheer extent of the assembly -- 13,000 people go into and out of the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists hold nightly shows in which they have fun about the countries that they think betray and sell, and drafts of contracts are already presented by hand instead of by e-mail.
The intensity is just starting to build: Almost all important ministers are here now and from Wednesday there will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president of global policy of the organization Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
Britain’s first 225 km/h fast train redefines Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5 p.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce an access drive that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h on its lightning ride from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and lie 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will then embark on the first Javelin commuter service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international rail network of faster, more reliable trains and connect the large urban areas of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living commuter cities, working hours would be radically reduced, and the switch from plane and car to train would reduce national carbon emissions and traffic jams.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still slow down in the UK’s high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis will deliver the report on December 30, according to the Times.
As a result, it receives a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which is to connect London to the West Midlands, will pass with a five-metre span in urban areas and places where the impacts on the environment are controversial.
In the open field, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, north-facing, leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to this in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route guide, in which a single high-speed route would lead into the West Midlands.
The route would split into or near Birmingham and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
“It seems to be the best-working option,” said one railroad insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first sub-route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to reset the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today just over an hour.
The designs offered the trains the ability to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned in such a way that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can ride on it.
Up to 18 trains per hour on the London-Birmingham route could be in operation.
This, in turn, would mean that a terminal would be needed in London, where 20,000 passengers could be delivered per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan should be continued in his opinion, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be made only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed lines to existing rail lines north of Birmingham, leaving the journey time between London and Scotland at over three hours.
This is considered a crucial turning point, so that a change from the plane to the train can be ensured, a guideline for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers come up for mortgage for a conservative’s <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 orangery
Alan Duncan, the leading member of the Conservatives’ House of Commons, has billed the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he built in his home in his constituency.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron because he complained that under house members must live “from lean rations,” increased his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to allow himself to build an oak-wood workshop at his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The House of Commons officials approved the applications at the time, and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is reviewing the spending of the House of Commons, and last night Duncan said the applications could have been "not yet cleaner or more comprehensible."
Duncan, one of the richest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost <0xC2><0xA3>1 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.1 million).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control office of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he planted a winter garden, which in the plans is called "Orangerie".
Neighbors described it as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked by the Committee on Standards and Privileges to take a position on the increased uptake of money during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage agreements.
The Committee released him last month after an examination of his expenditure from the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security of a <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 ($300,000) mortgage from his London home to his constituency house, which he had purchased in 1991, a year before his election to parliament.
Documents released this week show that Duncan received about <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,500) per month refunded as a mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,000) per month.
The interest rate on Duncan’s RBS mortgage has not changed during this time, suggesting that the total increase to finance the raise of <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>85,000).
The normal level of RBS mortgage interest dropped from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it is still standing.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,400) per month in May.
Duncan lost his post as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him after he said after the issue scandal that members of parliament would live “on lean rations.”
“In essence, it means working for the state that you have to live by lean rations and how S******e is treated.”
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and claim a disappearingly small portion, as measured by what is heard.
And I could have asked for the whole damn sum, but I don't."
The MP, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May because of his spending when it became clear that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden before he had cleared with the Fees Office.
In a protest in Duncan’s lawn, an activist dug a hole in the shape of a pound sign after it became known that he had asked for 4,000 pounds (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,500) over three years.
When asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said: "This had been approved by both the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg for the increase in value."
He added: "There is no debate about evading and sneezing or bending the rules or anything like that.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn’t be cleaner and clearer.”
Come all your faithful to admire Brighton's beach hut Advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for each December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free sparkling wine and traditional Mince Pies, full of dried-up pastries.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first No<0xC3><0xAB>l", where the hat decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer clergyman of the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and hold exciting celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and lively place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated across the globe and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate change, where police have made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people according to police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers, are marching in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the UN climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could take effect from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chair of the climate conference, the increasing mobilisation in the world for the climate contributes to what is illustrated by these demonstrations that the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 protesters, dressed in black, had smashed windows with plaster stones and hammers, a AFP journalist noted.
Anti-retirement police officers have intervened immediately and without consideration.
Police have announced that between 600 and 700 people, according to their estimates, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splinter groups, which have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in eastern France in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organisers of the demonstration, has criticised the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested “without distinction,” and has stressed that about a hundred of them were “still stuck in the streets on Saturday evening and locked up with handcuffs” despite the extreme.
The rather peaceful train has gone from Parliament to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers for a candlelight evening, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters have travelled with busses and trains from major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans were present, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with sky blue raincoats, have made a first run in the morning in Copenhagen, as you have followed the call of the friends of the earth to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
“Today we are going to the streets to demand a reappraisal of ecological debt in favor of the South,” said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t go on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that are dry, watercourses you can walk around, as has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organizations.
The European Parliament's José Bové, a global critic, announced that he had come to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific area, where many islands are located, which are particularly vulnerable as a result of the warming, has given the kick-off for the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people have taken to the streets, according to the organisers in Australia.
In Manila, there were a few hundred people, mostly students who marched in red and picked up bandanas, in which you have famed the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Jakarta, but also in Canada, protests by several hundred protesters took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (south), in Lille (north), in Bordeaux (west) and in Lyon (east).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that this is a “strike”.
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "strike".
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russo-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory that was recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
The voter turnout was around 58% a few hours before the polling station was closed, according to the Abkhaz election commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian total occupation, his spokesman Manana Manjgaladze said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia wants to prove by means of this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to choose a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen alongside the Russian president and the head of government, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are all in this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the conduct of the elections.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as a reference to Moscow's support, especially regarding the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations," answered Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament and raised a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition, represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements reached with Moscow last year, like those in Abkhazia Russia controlling the railway for over 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of voting must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated across the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement from the Copenhagen climate conference, where police, ready for action at any time, have arrested around 700 people on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which until December 18 receive delegates from 193 countries, who are looking for an agreement to come into force on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to penetrate.
A stage was built to welcome the intended speakers for an evening of candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train had passed, a group of protesters, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to snatch discs, a AFP journalist noted.
Anti-rest police officers immediately surrounded you and intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and clarified that they are mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer was injured in the incident, during which police said about twenty people were provisionally arrested, at the Kinn, and four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups in hand," said police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, as the helicopters of the law enforcement forces circled in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who arrived by train or by private vehicle from German major cities, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan, were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the "Friends of the Earth" was called up to a first group, which was supposed to represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
“Today we are going to the road to demand that the ecological debts be repaid to the people of the South,” said Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
“We can’t tell ourselves anymore: we still have time,” says Benin singer Angélique Kidjo.
"In Africa there are rivers that fail, there are watercourses through which one can run, which was never the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has approached environmental protection organizations.
French MEP José Bové told AFP he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer a difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific space, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given rise to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, dressed in red with bandanas, have advertised before the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people gathered during the demonstrations organized by the "Network of 350", in particular in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and in Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
The fields of geography and history, according to Chatel, stand out strongly from the school reform of the Lycées.
National Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" that the subjects of geography and history emerge from the school reform of the Lycées, even if they are not taught in the terminal (12th school year).
"The students of the Premi<0xC3><0xA8>re (11th school year) now have every four hours of the week and the same program," Mr. Chatel confirms.
For the Minister, "this holiness must be overcome", because according to him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in general a concentration "of the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific," he continued, adding: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals talking about the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminal at technical high schools."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanities found that nearly seven out of ten Frenchmen (69%) criticized the government’s project to eliminate compulsory teaching in history and geography in Terminal S (12th school year with a scientific profile).
The Minister replied, however, that there was no question as to a limitation of the philosophy of the program of Terminals S.
Luc Chatel also defended education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for Tuesday's protest against the project, which in their opinion falls victim to the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister carried out that they undergo an aptitude test in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year an admission test in which their teaching skills are examined.
In addition, they conduct internships during the year in M2 and then teach one year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He continued: “If you add all of the practices offered before the performance test, you will reach even more hours you spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours.”
The minister finally stated that he wants to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in public education."
He reiterated that he wants to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice president of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", has faced at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris on Saturday morning.
As one AFP journalist noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, in which experts each turn to the public for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
One wants to do something to reach people and make them feel like they want to learn more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22, and one of the organizers of the day, at the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students gave to the fish in the school's pool.
“Among the experts, twenty discussion participants were selected, even according to their charisma,” he said.
“Climate warming can be talked about for hours, but the core goals can also be outlined in a few minutes,” said Jean Jouzel of AFP, who spoke freely to about 50 people with the help of foils.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he said, hoping that the audience would understand that "Copenhagen's conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos filmed by these conferences will be available online from December 15th on the school’s website.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February and will then take place every two months.
Delay in payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
Trade unions called for a general day of action on Friday to ensure that the premiums and overtime, whose payment has been postponed for budgetary reasons until January, are transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Trade Union of Criminal Enforcement Officers (“FO-Penitentiaire”) called on employees who have no service to demonstrate on Tuesday morning in front of the law enforcement agency and block them in order to draw attention to the “stealing of what is theirs”.
The 3rd Union of Criminal Enforcement Officers ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "a strong mobilization in the various prisons", to which the non-payment of overtime, nighttime allowances and the "sun and holiday" allowance will be applied in this case.
The first union of law enforcement officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Institution Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show discontent and anger."
The head of the criminal enforcement agency and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime increased sharply in 2009 and not all were provided for in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice informed in the evening, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of the law enforcement officials guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
“I know very well about the efforts of the staff to keep and modernize our criminal enforcement system functional,” the Justice Minister said in the letter.
"I have instructed the head of the law enforcement agency to take immediate action so that such a situation, which has arisen due to a lack of assessment of the hours of overtime, does not repeat itself in the future," Alliot-Marie added.
The December salary therefore falls short, except for the management staff who enjoy high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "household constraints" have to be maintained.
“This is an absolute scandal,” the interregional trade union FO in Marseille is outraged and announces to boycott “all meetings and convenings” until further instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and public holidays, when the hours from October to December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime", also threatens the FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
“At a time when we are being charged more and more tasks without more staff being hired, trying to make money from the staff is more than inappropriate,” said the CGT trade union of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, notes the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
Obama believes he is always giving Christmas presents better than he gets himself.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas for the first time with his family in the White House, has applauded TV talk show host Oprah Winfrey that he is always giving better gifts than he gets himself.
During a special broadcast broadcast on the ABC channel on Sunday evening, the president and his wife Michelle gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
“Santa Claus also loves Bo,” confirms Michelle Obama, adding that the dog, of course, also gets a gift.
Michelle Obama rejected her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts, saying, “I made you beautiful gifts last year,” she denies the president.
"So please," he complained to her, slyly, pointing to the First Lady's pearl chain, "and who gave you this?"
During this one-hour broadcast in an uncompromising atmosphere with the well-known television presenter who had supported Barack Obama so vigorously during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they loved the most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a 10-gauge bike and also a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought to him at Christmas in Kenya.
“I remember when my father visited us one Christmas and brought me a basketball,” he said.
“It wasn’t until much later in my life that I understood that I had this ball from him.”
The First Lady remembered her doll house.
“I didn’t know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse,” said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL confirms that he was put into artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles due to significant "damages" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was resuscitated from Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors "damages from the operation of a tape recorder incident" that he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to a report in Paris.
However, the singer’s production company wanted to clarify that the situation was “under control” and said a new medical report would be available within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, however, Johnny Hallyday was moved into an artificial coma to avoid "pains and complications".
However, only after 48 hours was there a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of the AFP there was neither a confirmation nor a comment by the production company.
RTL also confirms that "it comes from certain sources" that after his first operation in Paris "no dr<0xC3><0xA2>nge" was laid.
The rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau due to a tape disc incident.
The surgery, planned for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This one was not available on Thursday evening for comments against RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a subsequent infection after the operation.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend is going through a "deep valley", but he assured himself that "no worries" about the rock musician because he is a "good fighter".
“He had called me before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was foolish to get on a plane for twelve hours after an operation like this,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection is contained."
Mr Camus also stated that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he did not feel any particular concern.
However, the concern about the singer’s health had grown ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, it was generally surprising that Johnny Hallyday had a "small intestinal cancer op", which led to a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented on extensively. Fans and journalists have not escaped the fact that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the people around him had to demystify a re-delivery to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet over his favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 Swimming World Championships, won an international title on Thursday over his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 short circuit in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records while a true record flood was expected.
One record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m layers of the men.
Damage to Bousquet, who wanted to reach the 50m freestyle after the world record, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two royal swimming distances, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed in 20.53 sec, in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere on an international level.
Bousquet defeated Croatia's Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russia's Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
“You can believe in ever greater things, and in this case I said, if the world record is within my reach, I will try.”
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started wearing polyurethane suits, which are banned from January 1, 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their epic in Istanbul, which first started in 1999 in the same competition.
The use of the combination did not pay off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record.
The young swimmer did not manage to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he continued with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn’t make a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job.”
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
U.S.: Tomb at Zola estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman tombstone, which appeared calculated with the French writer Emile Zola, was valued at $1.5 million on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the 3rd century AD and has always been valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of the Dionysus are depicted in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world", explained Florent Heintz, vice president of auctioning Roman and Egyptian antiquities.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
“The sale is still going on, but this part is certainly what buyers have offered the most so far,” Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was almost 300 years old in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family at home, after which she dived piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who used it in her bathroom of her Paris hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and the French Marshal.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
While searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of an "heritage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's departure attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been destroyed
On Thursday, Mexico declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic territory as no longer consensual, after this leadership had rejected by the government of Putsch as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place at night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement regarding the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, said.
According to the immigration authority, the plane sent by the Mexican government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring M. Zelayas, returned to its place of departure.
The Putsch government wanted to force Zelaya to "repent" and to apply for political asylum abroad under the guidance of Mr Zelaya.
However, the collapsed president refused, as he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcoming, acting head of state.
The Putsch regime “has suffered another failure by trying to move me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to give up,” Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has been running since the beginning of the political crisis in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the fallen president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under attacks of some accords.
The Mexican embassy has presented us with a request for guidance, which, unfortunately, we cannot accept because it does not include a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, the interior minister of the government of Putsch, told the Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I do not seek asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had replied in an interview with the Telesur channel, which is based in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had stressed, would only take place as president of the Honduran people.
Rumors of Zelaya’s departure had mobilized the supporters of the fallen president, who had joined the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it on Wednesday, after which the military there had stepped up its deployment.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the government of Putsch.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28, the day of the referendum he organized to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
He returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested for high treason, which he is accused of by the judiciary, according to the government of Putsch.
President Roberto Micheletti has managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the disputed election, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had voted massively against Zelaya's return to office until the end of his term of office on January 27.
Wall Street Rising, U.S. Trade Balance Feeds Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday with a high, the figures of the U.S. trade balance show a recovery in U.S. stocks as well as their partners: the Dow Jones accounted for 0.67%, the Nasdaq added 0.33%.
According to market closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, while Nasdaq, dominated by technology, rose from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Index Standard & Poor's 500 was written down with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There is good news from various industries, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial said.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market is focused only on "half-full glasses," she said.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily fixed on the figures of the US trade balance, "which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October compared to September.
Analysts, on the other hand, had expected deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of the company research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have risen against all expectations in the past week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average value of new job seekers has fallen “at the bottom of the year” over the past four weeks, said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has declined.
The profitability of government bonds for 10 years increased to 3,482 % compared to 3,432 % from Tuesday evening, the profitability of bonds for 30 years to 4,492 % compared to 4,408% from the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of ruling partisans chanting "Ladies in White"
A few hundred Cuban-held partisans on Thursday expelled the wives of political prisoners who had gathered in Havana for the purpose of World Human Rights Day and also destroyed another announcement that temporarily detained a good dozen dissidents.
Around the forty "Ladies in White", wives or close political prisoners, were executed on an open street by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on the march to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners.
Down with the Yankees!, "S<0xC3><0xB6>ldner!", "the road belongs to the revolutionaries!", "It lives Fidel and Raul!", the authorized partisans chanted with raised fist against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in Weiss" had taken place the previous night in Havana, where there have been neither injuries nor arrests.
In Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents were temporarily arrested by civilian police officers, who also took part in the demonstration in front of the International Human Rights Day on Thursday, a AFP reporter confirmed.
According to this journalist, police officers have been forced to enter civilian vehicles by the government’s partisans, using force.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As advocates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in Weiss" have an unapproved march for the purpose of "Please for the release of all political prisoners", whose number according to the dissident list of around 200 people, organized by Laura Pollan, one of the leaders, declared the leader of the group, Laura Pollan.
Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, of whom 53 are behind bars to date.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents of the regime to be "Soldiers" or "Agents" in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that the Cuban television paid for the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and “counterrevolutionary” reports.
Cuba, led by a unity party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of vilifying rights and freedoms, in particular that of freedom of expression.
Madman kills 80-year-old with knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A man armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old man and injured five other people in the centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) in the late afternoon.
According to the first information of the survey, the 28-year-old assailant had injured the eighty-year-old in or before a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives, according to police information, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to an officer in charge of the police union Alliance in the hospital, has suffered the consequences of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he has a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the three-timers, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were admitted to the hospital, where the 80-year-old died.
The other victim is in danger of life, as police sources say he was hit by vital organs that were apparently vital to his life.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and is said to have been hospitalized in a "shock state" according to a police source.
The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to police, is said to be immediately on the street, the flat boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty-one and a forty-year-old, the latter of both heavy.
The scenario remained dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat knives, which he was carrying cross behind his back, Arnaud Pressé, a head of the Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area, said on the spot.
Several passers-by, including young people, are said to have tried, according to the witness reports determined by the AFP, to banish the insane.
I saw a guy in the three-seater with a green vest.
Three young men tried to intervene.
They couldn’t do it because the guy was well built, said Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A horde fell on him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of house number 61, two city police officers, including their supervisor, tried to arrest the gunman and were injured with knife marks, according to police reports.
The event took place in one of the main battlements of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passers-by came to me to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I brought them into first-aid position and noticed a striking wound in the gastrointestinal area, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old, person was injured by cuts.
The state police have finally arrested the man who did not carry any identification papers with him.
The prosecutor’s office of Nanterre has commissioned the district report of the criminal police officer Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) with the case report.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out being admitted to a mental institution.
According to another police source, six police officers asked him to gang him up at the police station in Clichy, where he had been abducted.
He was "in a state of excitement" like "all the spiritual confusions of this kind, in which the forces are released during the process of tathering".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for suspension of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly called for the prosecution against his client, who is currently in his residence in Switzerland due to a sitting violation of more than 30 years ago, to be tried on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States).
Chad Hummel, lawyer for the director of the "pianist", filed a gross procedural error in front of three judges of the California Court of Appeals in the second district at the time of the hearing in 1977.
I demand at the scene a release from punishment, M. Hummel explained, before adding that the behaviour of the trial judge Laurence Rittenband at the time of the trial "let it run down a cold back".
According to him, the judge Rittenband, who had died in the meantime, had discussed his case before his trial with a public prosecutor who allegedly told him Roman Polanski had earned a breeding house -- which was a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: pursued and desired), especially by the inquisitive public prosecutor David Wells.
Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that the authors of the documentary had "beliefed".
Should the Court refuse to stop the criminal proceedings, Mr. Hummel demands the conduct of a trial that would allow him to present the evidence for his argument.
For its part, the prosecution has reiterated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the abolition of the defendant’s assets cannot be taken seriously, as long as Roman Polanski does not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the U.S. in 1978, before announcing the penalty measure for “illegal sexual relations” with a 13-year-old minor.
Since then, he has not been to the United States.
The Los Angeles County Deputy Attorney General, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, who are fleeing? asks Mrs. Asayma.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the court for a favor and thus despises his authority".
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to announce their decision, even pointed out that "there are other options for escape".
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the suspension of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also called for the suspension of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate being harassed by every resurgence of the Polanski affair, adding: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Twenty-three years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on the basis of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced in anticipation of a possible extradition to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is braked by the rise of the dollar and closes without a course.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without a price, in a market that was torn between better-than-expected indicators and an increase in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
"Honestly, the market is pretty quiet," Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management noted.
“He remains narrowly limited, the trade volume has become very low and I think this will remain so until the end of the year.”
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than envisaged, which "have contributed to improving the market outlook for the solidity of the recovery of the economy", summarized analysts of Charles Schwab.
In the U.S., retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, which is already two months behind schedule and far more than expected.
U.S. consumer confidence improved significantly in December, up from 73.4 in the previous month to 67.4, according to the University of Michigan’s index forecast.
However, the indexes were hampered by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level against the euro in the past two months, pushing sectors vulnerable to the economic situation downwards,” said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
As a result, the technological values have lost something on the ground.
The bond market is back.
The yield on the bond over 10 years increased by 3,540 % on Wednesday evening from 3,482 % and the yield on the bond over 30 years to 4,497% from 4,492% the day before.
Miss World re-election in South Africa
After a month’s tour of South Africa, the 112 Miss World title candidates will cross the last hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be chosen as the most beautiful woman in the world and watch a billion TV shows.
During this great beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were selected to be Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true shard of fun.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, was simply exceptional.
“I’ve seen a lot of things and had a lot of experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition will be held for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, from 5 p.m. to 5 p.m. (Central European Time).
I couldn’t imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, stressed Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathing landscapes".
After a month of galas, samples, encounters with the press and safari, the Miss now focuses on the competition.
Inderin Pooja Chopra hopes to step into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as to emulate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and became both Bollywood stars.
It is of course every woman’s dream to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about the look.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be highlighted with music and dance.
The candidates parade in traditional costumes and not to forget, in swimsuits.
The show is presented by a television presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, the former beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a Miss World committee official, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to receive the world with an almost overwhelming cordiality and pride, says Julia Morley, chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari that visited the famous township in Soweto, but this time they tasted the bike and the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them a hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not usual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Her most beautiful memory, however, is undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to promote a little more for this event.
I'm wrong about people I probably could never get close to otherwise.
I will definitely return to the 2010 World Cup, promised excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News of Johnny Hallyday is “very positive” according to his son David
News of Johnny Hallyday are "very positive", his son David assured on Friday on his arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press on leaving the plane, where he arrived from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m.).
The singer’s son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would “at least” go to the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in which Johnny Hallyday was admitted to Paris on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection after an operation on a tape disc incident on November 26.
The singer was "put into an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and carry out his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted to Paris on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection following a disk surgery on November 26.
The singer had to undergo surgery again in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the sick changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia took part in a school event at the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday, in which her daughter Jade goes to school, a AFP photographer said.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the Los Angeles hospital on Monday.
The producer has put a heavy strain on the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer at the Clinique internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris on November 26.
We were told that he had committed the purest massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were completely disarmed, Mr. Camus explained.
I have heard that a court procedure may be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "traveled to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I phoned this doctor personally, who assured me that he considered this trip to be completely unproblematic, which surprised me a lot, since I already have two disk surgeries behind me myself, he added.
Shortly before, he told RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital "without drainage, without everything" after the operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artist’s environment.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times due to failed operations and not to be forgotten due to tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the medical board, called him "a man without scruples" who has "regularly" to answer to the board of directors and is "everything but recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention would have been "perfectly completed" and that the post-operative examinations would have been "normal".
The operation "did not cause any bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been running since late summer, seems to be in question.
It is quite clear that for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens) it is a bit too short, Mr Camus explained.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and calls on the party Nouveau Centre to no longer use its seal
The party alliance, which is overseen by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou's MoDem party, has on Friday been subjected to an attempted takeover of the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the part of the president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, no longer vigorously reacts to the document and is threatened by it.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal as he believes that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political legacy after reaching the left hand.
By the way, the Minister of Defense, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to confirm this strategy in front of the NC National Council on Saturday.
In support of his efforts, he had received the support of Member Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now at NC), who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to apply for this brand in 2004 at the Institut national de la proprietaire industrielle.
However, the office of the party alliance UDF overseen by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrous's friends broke the silence and made it clear that they did not allow themselves to be evicted and set a time limit for the minister and the MP under threat of prosecution, to no longer use this seal.
In recent days, you have made numerous statements that you would propose to your political movement to take over the UDF seal +, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, of the SenDeuts Monets party.
You probably also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre +, the slogan + of today's UDF + printed on your political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF’s office declared, and urges the NC Party to “immediately remove the mention of the UDF name from all material and from (their) website”.
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the trademark's ownership rights to its legal claimants".
If you refuse to do so, we will raise a complaint against you in order to comply with the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that “UDF” has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends “have made the choice” to leave this 2007 to establish a competitive movement, as others had already done in 2002 to found the “UMP” party.
Therefore, according to the signatories, the Nouveau Centre party has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
They continue to recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 approved the three-year accession to the MoDem Party as well as the establishment of a branch to defend the “material and moral interests” of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the company continues, "he was no longer a member of the UDF, but of the UMP, at the time when he applied for the brand name.
It benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way, from the lack of the acronym UDF to do this for itself.
Furthermore, you have to bear in mind that this recklessness is the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the NC's strategy: "It seems to us that in politics as well as in life it is more worthy to make a name for ourselves rather than to try to get away from anonymity by assuming that you do not
Affair Liliane Bettencourt: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier is sentenced for exploiting weakness
The court of Nanterre on Friday decided to judge the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds in order to make a part of their fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will have to be held accountable on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploiting weaknesses in court, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter fatten and at the same time have the pillars of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire in hand.
Similarly, the 15th Criminal Court ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is jointly carried out by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not under the conditions laid down by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigations.
The doctors appointed on Friday are expected to present a report before March 10, 2010, in which you will clearly state whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undergo this investigation.
I will speak to her, said the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
As for Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady, which you have to protect, he confirmed.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed a criminal complaint against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother’s weakness for years to receive gifts of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, cheques and cheques.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always objected to being manipulated by the photographer she considers a long-time friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ pleas on Friday have led to a large family debacle.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer has called for three letters from her client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she distrusts the husband of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Could you please explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise I have never been able to speak again since their marriage".
Once again, Nanterre’s public prosecutor believes that the complainant had no right to react in this way, especially because a pre-trial judge has rejected her request in recent days to initiate a court defense proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place,” said Marie-Christine Daubigney, a public prosecutor’s representative.
The court has now decided to deliver a judgment after the trial of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Learning?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, the position of the companies vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis the consumer before the marketing revolution: it is for the staff joining "values" determines the best as it was previously on the consumer products manufactured by the technicians in the factory.
By giving the customer the focus of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets on the spot... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose customer preferences on a regular basis!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that particularly affects employees.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of F&Eund, which is even more crucial, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique <0x3D> Economic Intelligence) "requires from all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking approach"; it demands from employees an approach that completely contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution that would consist in putting employees at the centre of the company’s interests equally alongside the customers.
The very conditional benefit of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, like the questionnaire that Orange submitted to its payees, stimulate this revolution in relation to management practices?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to find that the whole structure, given a new situation, eventually comes to do primarily what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases proportionally to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a greatly simplified idea of human behavior.
Emerging from the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanical.
They take over, through intellectual comfort, the old behavioral theory that has recently been reactivated by the American "Neurosciences" and unwittingly spread by research institutes and by the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to implement the “ lever” (sic) for employee engagement, a recent survey by Ipsos, published in Le Figaro.fr, strengthens leaders in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today’s world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into every consideration or practice of management: for the payee, the commitment to the company is only possible when it clearly appears as a means to realize a part of their dreams, their ambitions and their projects.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, the executives of companies can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and put their Human Resource Management back in the right place.
Thus, they create a fertile soil that is conducive to the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo’s speech: the “just war” brings Obama praise from the right
U.S. rights welcomed Barack Obama’s speech in Oslo on Friday evening and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had mocked the awarding of the prize to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the speech of the president, following the example of the former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election of Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the USA Today daily newspaper, and added that she herself spoke out about a “sometimes necessary” war in her so-called published memoirs.
War is, of course, the last thing that I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday sought to justify the use of force in Oslo; a way to explain his decision nine days ago to 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the opinion that the president has done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, congratulated the former president of the House of Representatives, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, I felt this speech was entirely historical, explained Ginrich, who was interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, who is considered by some as a possible candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, said he was pleased to see a “President of the Left” who reminded Nobel Committee members that they would “not be free from greed and an award for peace.”
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama has held “a very American speech.”
In addition to portraying himself as a “cosmopolitan,” he has “spoken like an American president” when he pointed out that Europeans “live in a security bubble that they did not create themselves and do not do much to protect them,” Gerson said.
Among the few, unconvinced rights, former UN envoy John Bolton, a hawk of the Bush era, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "boring, arrogant, and inspirational".
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama is defending the military’s withdrawal.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, the massacre can easily be justified on the innocent, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, continues to be laudable on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama early on, called the address itself for a speaker like him known for his talent “a monumental work.”
The speech in Oslo “offers a roadmap to control international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the California daily said.
The New York Times believes that Obama “declared the necessary discourse” and calls his speech “dark and exemplary at the same time.”
Remote Driver: Three Marathons for an Agreement That Secures Christmas Supply
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the unions of the street association and the TLF – the only employer organization that remained until the end – came to an agreement on Friday evening that put an end to the strike order and the threatening heavy supply pass for Christmas.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement, which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators separated early Friday morning in the hope of quickly signing the agreement late in the morning.
And this despite the fact that the three employers’ associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 until the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 the agreement was signed.
The conflict "had done a lot of damage to the company" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
“It’s not very much, but we’re starting small,” says Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now instructed not to block the supply centers anymore.
“However, there will probably always be some dissenters who are not satisfied with the agreement,” he adds.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good deal", although it was "difficult to accommodate these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is at 170 euros per month for the low and at 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
“This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees,” said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of “a historic agreement.”
Richard Jaubert (CGT) expressed his views on "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs by 3 %, as well as the maintenance of the General Council for Road Transport in the first half of 2010, which will in particular allow to address the issue of 13th month's salary and the modernisation of the tariff agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the reduction in taxes for employers amounting to 100 million euros" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the Bill on Adjusted Finance for 2009, which was passed by the National Assembly on Thursday night to Friday.
The government calls for an "identical" vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated with that organisation and then to be valid in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour for the entire professional level.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", Bussereau assures.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR association denounced a “fraudulent trade” because the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million “had already been promised to the sector to compensate for a portion of the carbon tax”.
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but rather to avoid crushing the Gans-Esser on the coming Christmas days, the UNOstra complains.
For the association Otre, the agreement threatens "to sculpt a large grave to the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the RATP proposals
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Paris metropolitan area and the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd strike day between the unions and the head of the RATP (independent Parisian passenger transport administration) continued with their strikes.
There were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00 on this important shopping weekend before Christmas. On the central route (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains was ready for use and outside the central route was only one of four trains.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing travellers to switch.
Galeries Lafayette, a chain of department stores that counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that “the RATP is trying to connect the big businesses traffic-technically”.
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The RATP section of the route connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains was scheduled to run at the main traffic time, and almost none during the low traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no man-made commotion on the railways, as the inhabitants of <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France had taken a stand on the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than otherwise, especially due to the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, an engineer (29), explained that he would be extra "a half hour earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned the care of the passengers by staff and law enforcement, pointed out that there had been no shortages at Saint-Lazare station.
Trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left via Saint-Lazare station to ensure connection to the metros there.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the strikers once again took place, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified after the meeting with the leadership chief on Friday afternoon as "possible".
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific drafting of a protocol for line RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career paths, etc.
However, this is not what drivers want, according to Thierry Garon (South), they are demanding a long-delayed pay surcharge.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself put its wage surcharge proposals in brackets, stressing that the top management "is not able to solve a problem, while this was still possible with the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a reconvened meeting was scheduled for Monday for a "comprehensive review of working conditions".
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers searched the premises of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the top leadership who so far refused any discussion during the strike, and a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line after a pre-announcement by Unsa and Independents.
The associations demand a surcharge of 120 (unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Independents), and they also complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travelers are travelling daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross salary of 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a salary surcharge of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as sun and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the country’s pro-Kurdish main party; a decision followed immediately by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government enormously difficult, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The “Party for a Democratic Society” (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a “place for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,” according to the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kilic four days after the decision before the press.
According to Kili<0xC3><0xA7>, the decision would have been unanimously made by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to enforce the resolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including the chairman Ahmet T<0xC3><0xBC>rk and the policewoman Aysel Tug, were expelled from parliament.
In addition, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turkey and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party’s goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders said before the verdict that the parliamentarians would rather leave the parliament than be treated as partyless parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is seen by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organization.
Numerous observers are of the opinion that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures it has "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to label it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The Constitutional Court’s judgment serves as the basis for the Government, which seeks to meet the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, in order to have the support of the PKK defeated by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK chief Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan had led to clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the court’s announcement, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP premises in the multi-million-dollar city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, mostly populated by Kurds.
The law enforcement forces used tear gas grenades and water throwers as the demonstrators began to throw molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
According to the judgment, Turkey assumed that the court’s decision “will deepen the despair even further”.
"Turkey cannot clarify this (Kurdish) question on the basis of a party's ban," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose, in principle, the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems,” said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
“This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic opening that has been promoted by the government,” said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously get caught up in a reaction from the PKK," he added.
On Thursday, the PKK became aware of an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall may come
A really crisp winter, that’s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the FES Winter Service Manager.
However, so that his employees can try and master the entire vehicle technology.
At the weekend, meteorologists say it could be this far for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is following an exact plan.
As soon as there is extensive snow in Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-rails will be taken off with large-haul vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, major traffic and transit routes such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
But also fire brigade access routes, <0xC3><0x96>PNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with bends, such as the Atzelbergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
The FES service starts at 3 a.m.
The approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better, if necessary.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o’clock at night, “so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts”.
It will be difficult if it doesn't snow until 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the Winter Service Manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the scattered vehicles."
Only after that, if it does not snow any further, are Zubringer- and Schlo<0xC3><0x9F>ungsstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, which also includes the Rat-Beil-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, on the line.
The last priority has side and side roads.
There will be complaints there, knows Brauburger.
At five o’clock in the morning, the footmen of the FES make their way, danger points and crossings are cleared primarily.
The FES usually can’t take care of all the bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30 pm, says Brauburger.
As there is on this fast plain, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the scatterer is on the move.
If necessary, he will also be called by the police.
The cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other flesh-eating dinosaurs: The two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-long animal ran on two powerful hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, bent teeth, short arms with shells and a long tail.
Had the species lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to have these body features, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in the journal Science from Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationship, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Triassic, team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History reports.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation, they brought together the remains of a total of five individuals.
Finding Confirms Theories About Dino Early History
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary finding: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts don’t necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current teachings, dinosaurs first emerged about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these Ur-Dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, experts argue about when the oaks split into their three main lines of development: the meat-eating theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor, and also the birds, which are known as the "long-necked" steuris, the orchidsau, and the orchidsaurus.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
In the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air sacs, as they also possessed the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air sacs, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Since the associated line of the giant sauropods later also possessed air sacs and light-building bones, this useful innovation had probably already been brought about by the joint advance of both groups.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
According to this, the three lines of development separated early and spread from South America over all parts of the earth, which formed a single land mass as Pangaea supercontinent at the time.
This is due to the fact that the team together with Tawa hallae found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot be descended from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
There are, of course, contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, a distorted picture could result, because in South America there have simply been very few primitive Dino fossils preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare sideline of the Reptilian tribe to the dominant agricultural animals of the Middle Ages is still a mystery.
During the Triassic, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flight-saurians, and numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the kinship on the border from the Triassic to the Jurassic died out.
Success stories don’t last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite struck a group of animals that had also developed in the Triassic and since then has been tempting a shadow: the mammal.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto stand on it, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Teachers from Naples are involved, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe-Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t beats waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers from Goethe University, as well as from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "misapprove" the police action initiated by the Bureau.
University President Werner M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Estler had cleared the building occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike last week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organized teaching events of students and teachers by a police command".
The clearance represents an "unacceptable interference" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the delegitimization and criminalization of protest" and distracts from the content.
The Bureau has moved away from the necessary discourse.
The teachers call for the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupants did not support the damage, it said.
Legitimate protest
The youth of the Verdi Union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern about one’s own future, says Verdi Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
However, Hessen’s science minister Eva K<0xC3><0xBC>hne-H<0xC3><0xB6>rmann (CDU) defended the actions of the uni-president and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a recent hour on Thursday in Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, according to CDU country's deputy Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Left saw this differently.
The CDU is taking painted walls to the foreground to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the students’ arguments and demands, we have cleared up.
The left has filed a request calling on the Interior Minister to report on the police intervention.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a heavily guarded location in the Soviet Union for secret weapons research.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, Selenograd’s representatives had been in contact with the Riedberg Science Center in Frankfurt – with the Union Institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed planner Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural sciences focus on research will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange (disambiguation)
It is a matter of continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Firms of the FIZ will be able to take a foothold on the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian science companies want to obtain orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronics Technology, the large companies Citronics and Rosssijskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plan city" for armament research.
Selenograd (literally translated "green city") was named after the forested hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
The S21 is much more than laying down a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg state capital into unclean construction site chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Railway stations with tracks that end in the middle of the city were then considered to be 19th century traffic fossils that looked like brake pads of a modern rail traffic, as it used to take a tremendous amount of time to refuel locomotives from the rear to the front.
Get in, keep it short, keep going - that's how it's supposed to go.
And that’s why the train stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being tackled, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian capital it is almost priceless to implement the divestment.
However, train stations no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there are modern turning trains with motor vehicles and control cars on both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction route to Ulm is now being approached.
Local and local politicians have done it.
The railway is involved, also because the risks of the largest single infrastructure project in the Republic of taxpayers and not the state corporations.
In urban planning, the project can still be justified in some ways.
A new urban space is being created, which - believed to be the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of greenery.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The transit station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger traffic, to which huge growth was attributed - typically in the 1980s.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap aircraft.
Modern transport policy, however, must first be about strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
However, the new construction route is not suitable for freight trains due to steep climbs.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 indirectly also tangs many other railway projects.
A total of six billion euros will be banned in Swabian.
This is the official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion to be realistic.
Fixed, in the next decade the money will be missing at other nodes and congestion in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the Ministry of Transport’s list.
One of the most important is the extension of the well 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, it has been built on the track at the time.
Urgently, it would be necessary to press the tube right here.
However, S21 will act as a brake lock.
The Rhine valley route becomes the bottleneck for international freight traffic: in the heart of Europe.
The government is considering a decision on the airport.
The state government has made public on Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will go into revision against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH).
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to legally review the more than 400-page VGH ruling, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had stated in writing that in the event of the construction of the planned Northwest Land Railway at Frankfurt Airport, the country had to re-register the night air ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 a.m., as provided by the state government, is not to be agreed with the legally required protection of the population from night air noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 if it is going to go against the verdict in revision.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the government’s representatives to waive a review at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Group leader Torsten Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promise to a night-flight ban, otherwise this would be considered a "word-breaker".
It is damn hard if you can keep his word, said Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir in reference to the FDP election slogan "We keep word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel, the state government is trying to get to their night flights with "right turn and trick-or-treating".
An accurate legal review will take your time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a “quick first impression”.
We need a more legal decision, said Stefan M<0xC3><0xBC>ller (FDP).
As she represented the opposition, the statements of her group on the night air ban had never been.
U.S. Banks Pay Back Help
The crisis-stricken U.S. big banks are wiping out their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America repaid the aid from the Tarp Savings Fund in the amount of a total of $45 billion (about 30 billion euros) to one stroke.
And Citigroup also plans to reimburse state aid, according to a report by the US broadcaster CNBC.
The institutions want to get rid of the limitations associated with the acceptance of the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the elimination of high fees.
The Bank of America had provided some $19 billion of fresh money to investors through wandering loans.
She took the rest of the sum from her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by Spartan sales.
Bank Chief Kenneth Lewis expressed his gratitude to the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money injections have helped over a very difficult time.
At the height of the financial crisis, the moneyhouse had taken over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market in order to free itself from its obligations towards the state.
As early as Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a roughly $20 billion hefty surge in its capital, CNBC reported, citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesperson did not want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid.
Quick selection
It all went faster than I thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had pushed the acting editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night, the board wanted to vote on the staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin, was a favorite.
However, there was no confirmation from the transmitter for this - officially, in order not to prefer the procedure.
However, Markus Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, the ZDF intendant, should also have played a role in not further harming the ZDF intendant.
Frey, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote was not yet determined at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender by another five years, failed on the board of directors.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's election was a bitter defeat for Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, an expected one.
The majority in the board of directors had already signalled weeks before the election that they did not want to confirm Brender in office.
Organized the resistance against the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that, under Brender, the ZDF’s newscasts had lost on turn-on quotas, he rejected another term of office of the high-profile editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was rigged.
In the past, even 35 state legislators had interfered in the debate, which considered Koch’s actions to be unconstitutional.
It's useless.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked at S<0xC3><0xBC>dwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey switched to the ZDF, initially to the "today's journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "morning magazine"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the election of Brenders, who was still elected as journalist of the year by the industry magazine Medium Magazine on Wednesday.
Koch’s counterpart on the board of directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that countries should change the ZDF state treaty in such a way that the applicant’s personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also excluded an excerpt of party politicians from the ZDF supervisory bodies.
Brender’s likely successor, Peter Frey, had recommended to the Board of Directors with a clever move – by criticizing the board sharply for it immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate him as both a shaman without loss of face for the post of editor-in-chief and the board of directors, without suspecting that he would take a party candidate to office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is assigned to the left-wing liberals anyway.
Study Is Unraveled
Partial success for the students: After one year of the educational strike, the ministers of culture of the countries finally joined on Thursday: At a meeting of the ministers of culture and university rectors, both sides agreed to improve the conditions of study at Bachelor and Master.
In the future, students should also be able to master their studies.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the test loads: in principle, each study module should only conclude with a single exam.
In addition, the work load of the students is to be checked and a "realistic and representative measure" is ensured.
In addition, politics and universities want to simplify the recognition of examination services between the universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for bachelor’s and master’s degree programmes more flexible.
There should be no country rules other than that.
Fewer Tests
Since the start of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have been carrying the winged word of better studentship in their mouths.
For the first time, it was filled with concrete content.
The so-called accreditation board decided to drastically reduce the number of exams in part: "Each module usually ends with only one exam", it says in a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially re-regulate the admission of study courses.
With the “significant reduction of the exam burden,” accreditation board chairman Reinhold Grimm declared, “a failure to develop content that significantly affected student eligibility.”
In addition, the "studyability" should be the "decisive criterion" in the design in the future.
Modules such as content should be "strictly checked" to see if "unnecessary student consonances in choosing the
“Events” would be avoided.
Students would have "the right to receive playrooms that enable and promote self-initiatives".
The rules shall apply in the case of the admission of new courses of study, but also in the case of the examination of existing courses of study.
These must be “reaccredited” every five years – which means that it will take until 2015 for all courses to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout the country, which are under the accreditation council set up by the countries.
The ministers of culture had called on the countries in October to “responsively” influence the agencies so that the stuffing is not too big and the examination regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities of higher education have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, Rhineland-Palatinate provided additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, the universities are primarily to set up tutoring programs and strengthen study counselling as well as examination and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce a new version of the Higher Education Act into Parliament.
After this, only a single examination is required for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to become more flexible, to ensure the recognition of certificates of performance at other universities and to facilitate access to the Master’s degree.
By the end of next year, all courses of study in the country should be checked for their studentship.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had again disputed the conditions of study in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Chairman of the Juso Higher Education Groups called for the design of the educational policy to no longer take place "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, the students should now also "talk a word" as affected.
The future academics received support from the president of the University Rectors Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experiences", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with whom the HRK consults on a joint reform paper.
The Union of Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough in total: it calls for a legal claim that would allow any graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access a further master’s degree.
On the other hand, countries need to ensure that there will be enough master’s courses with the best possible study conditions for today’s generation of undergraduate students tomorrow, says GEW board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire significantly more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not speak out about a free access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller
Entering and exiting Germany is almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, in which he discusses the arrival experience of a dissident who won freedom, but at the same time lost his language space.
Born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publisher before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt Poetry Lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
For considerable extra-literary attention, he took care of last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, where it was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distortion of its security acts".
Apparently, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner left a statement in which he admitted to Romanian fellow writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his co-operation as IM for the Romanian Secret Service Securitate.
Together with some of the attendees, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The application attempts would have started in vain, first in 1971.
I am, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner concluded, "so someone who has not defended himself enough against intimidation attempts by the security forces."
The lyricist Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize Laureate for Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and its unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that shakes the foundations and the downfall of a political system.
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is, as far as one can tell, not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
IM Walter played a role in his act of security, according to S<0xC3><0xB6>llner’s confession of the literary scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He "stuck him out" in all points that were difficult for him at the time, according to Markel.
It is a moral necessity for him to make this remark.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner’s statement was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, but it is not surprising that a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service are acknowledged.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securite-Spitzel, Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller had already written in July, after reading her own document, 914 pages.
Those affected, it may be suspected, will be speculated and in some cases may have also known the clear name behind the cover names Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast to the fact that the Stasi documents are now very process-safe, the handling of the residual assets of the securities monitoring is still very diffuse.
A systematic education has been pushed back and hampered in recent years.
One of the Birthler Authority’s corresponding National Security Council (CNSAS) was founded only in 1999, but the issuance of the documents has been rather dragging ever since.
It is only since 2005 that there is a law regulating the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former security members in Romania is still very great, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, revealed an interview in which a former security chief from Temesvar spoke contemptuously about the prize winner.
She has a psychosis, after all, she was interrogated only once.
The infamy of power meant to express itself here in the form of freedom of opinion.
Certainly, the case of S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, as so often in the context of hidden debt, inevitably raises questions.
Why only now? Who was injured? The sympathetic reaction of the audience to S<0xC3><0xB6>llner’s confession makes it hoped that the continuation of this chapter will be determined rather by the urge of knowledge than by guilt and shame.
To genesis of the work of Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
S<0xC3><0xA4>ttigungsbelief Champions League
It seemed as if an adrett-dressed outdoor serviceman had just arrived from a very nice Christmas party, at which a sports item manufacturer Goodies had distributed, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the outfitter a quarter-hour after midnight in a carpentry.
The man with the striking plain was allowed to drive himself because of the still foreign city.
Otherwise, he would have been able to drive himself - alcohol was not in the game at all, and fortunately the 55-year-old was just as few.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work will continue.
Or just get it right.
In the words of the Swiss only three days previously committed: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 victory against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: there will be a brutal hard fight against the abstention."
The “much more important task” is ahead of Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat in Mainz the king-class performance in the league everyday.
And the newly revealed weaknesses after the fast three gates through Marica (5th), Tr<0xC3><0xA4>sch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Exemption
The Champions League eight-game final (innings 16/17. + 23/24 February/ replays 9/10. + 16/17. March) will be played in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the fulminant state of the Babbel follower was maintained.
Not only with the supposed Savior, who had given the insecure Stuttgart professionals confidence, readiness to use and joy of play in the short term.
I went to the players and told them they were supposed to rely on their strengths, and stopped them from being brave, Soul Clamper Gross explained the simple-sounding recipe of success that had no longer worked under therapist Babbel.
He has unleashed some magic, Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann admitted, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who advanced to the best player on the pitch after a week-long injury break thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the established "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the new boss's way of working: "He's a man who's going through and dissipating.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Under Babbel, it had obviously failed.
VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, sports director Horst Heldt warns
But the VfB Stuttgart needs constancy above all.
Just like Gross, players and managers were also wary of overestimating the victory against a weakened and completely oversold defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 came the bad awakening, Khedira said.
And Sports Manager Horst Heldt said that although one season goal has been reached, the others are still further away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt was not happy on his 40th birthday even after the first home win for three months was due to the events of the weekend, in the form of a TV interview broadcast just before the start of the game by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that the others make and not the Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had accused the board of weak leadership and decided to change coach to pressure of pubertal fans.
Even though his free day had been wiped out after the games, Lehmann considered it a sign of lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmann’s statements were “characterized by pure egoism,” Heldt recalled and announced consequences for the finalist.
They probably won’t be friends for life anymore, the two 40-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with all the others that without the preliminary work by the replaced coaching team, the playful and combative strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have "a big part in the success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and also the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World Heavyweight Championship (WWW)
Hot Duel in Bern: Always provocative challenger Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard laps, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title after the WBC version.
The verdict of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains the boxing world champion in heavyweight standings.
The 38-year-old champion after the WBC version defeated Kevin Johnson by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Saturday night in Bern.
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice World Champions of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it did not work with the K.O., which everyone expected.
Klitschko expanded his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, he had to beat himself twice due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Berne Arena, the 2.02-metre-long Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
However, the eleven-centimeter-smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly escaped the World Champion's blows, so that Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous rights to an end.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his strokes rarely met the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had taken care of some vertebrae before the battle in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "hateful zombie" who "can't do anything right".
When weighing, the champion was then provoked on Friday to push Johnson’s sunglasses off his nose “to see his eyes.”
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years off, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered his WBC belt, which he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
I only got one hit in this fight and am physically very well in shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is World Champion of the WBO and IBF Associations.
However, the WBA’s belt is worn by the British David Haye after he was able to dethrone the 2.13-metre-long Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a September fight against Vitali Klitschko.
It is alleged that his promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko at the London Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group leader J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin has called Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings of Kunduz's airstrike, the opposition defense minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has been subjected to a deliberate deception.
The minister said of the deadly bombardment on two September tanker trains "certainly the untruth", Green Group chief J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD news channel "Dagesschau".
It’s called a lie; he lied.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had read Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday it had become known that the attack was not only about the destruction of the kidnapped cargo, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
The U.S. airstrike, demanded by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, killed or injured as many as 142 people, according to the NATO investigation report.
Greens, SPDs and left-wingers on Saturday urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government’s Afghan policy – and whether the Chancellor’s Office, the Bundeswehr and the news service have approved this new strategy, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate K<0xC3><0xBC>nast called for.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor’s Office did not influence concrete efforts by the Federal Armed Forces in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the presentation of the Ministry on the reasons behind the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have correctly and completely informed about the background of the tanker attack.
Officials said they had denied the existence of NATO reports and kept sensitive details from the minister.
However, from the environment of the two top officials, it was rumored that they had even referred to the Ministry of Defense for several reports, including a two-page document of the commanding Colonel Klein and a Fieldhunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked in a letter to clarify the facts, reports the "Frankfurt Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He has not received an answer so far, he said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this will be clarified in the inquiry committee of the Bundestag, which wants to be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see pictures and hear voices in waking state, others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental illness and in drug noise, the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie with our eyes closed in our dark rooms, we may unhinderedly give ourselves to the wildest imaginations and imaginations.
However, those who experience, see and hear things that others do not see or hear in the growing Western world are usually considered crazy or drug-addicted, at least as special.
But such images and voices do not arise only in mental illness or in drug abuse.
Guilt has our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, madness, and reality blur.
Traumatically altered states of waking consciousness can occur in a variety of forms, at best we call them visions, at worst madness.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic withdrawal states, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the brain’s neuronal messenger substances – mainly dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – is derailed and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him anymore.
The connection between madness and dream has been occupied by philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle termed hallucinations as a form of dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great similarity of delusion with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the insensitivities, with all the oddities.
It was in the fall of 2001, when Henning T. turned into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and quiet.
The gravity no longer has power over him, he hovers on the room deck.
He feels a step.
Behind him winged devil shapes with blood-red, distorted fries, toothpicking.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, burning boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices swirling from walls and radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that chirp and insult him.
Henning T. rips two cables from the stereo system, knots them to a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs up to a loudspeaker and places the sling around his neck.
Jump.
The sling is loose.
That's supposed to be a lesson for you, screaming the voices in drum-shell-fattening chorus, "go to the clinic and let yourself be cured!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizophrenic-affective paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, for three years he is married.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The images are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population has schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common illness after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, people affected can usually no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they end up in an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship, or persecution.
Voice-hearing is especially common – voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The affected person can no longer separate important from unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the doors to a flood of ideas and fantasies that arise from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, MD of the General Psychiatry Clinic at the University Hospital Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed at it.
At the same time he goes into a passive role, he is, like in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Therefore, schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality match is usually not possible for them, the truffles are cruel reality, awakening excluded.
Having experienced a hallucination once in your life
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, “but the sensual and spatial structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved.”
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brains beat caprioles, researchers are still puzzling.
Exceptional conditions can cause any person to lose the relationship of reality in a short period of time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the determining factors alone.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, due to a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explains fox.
But it remains a mystery how the disorder of the neuronal system arises, which also does not manifest itself at first over many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychoses as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brains are hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get which, says L<0xC3><0xBC>beck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether truffles are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a question of the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and deceptions for ten years, and last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are among the typical companion phenomena of psychoses, but also of amazingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, they often include diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and spinal cord trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to Caste, consist of memory contents that are usually retained.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too poorly inhibited; when our brain is running hot or even when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or a psychosis.
But it’s also an exhilaration, stress, love-hate or other mental state of emergency.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lifetime.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the gymnasium there.
A normal girl, actually.
If there were no pictures and voices.
During the break, it can happen that a slender boy with long, dark hair appeals to it.
When it answers him, the fellow students look at it as a surprise - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They consider the shy girl to be a spooked daydreamer, but Sarah K. does not dream, she knows.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she asks sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other truffles are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
Often, the images of the truck are also a burden.
If she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just introducing a new fellow student, while explaining mathematical equations to everyone else, both hearingly and visibly on the board.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
If she waits for bed in her dark room, which is too rare and too late, she can often not tell if she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the freckles or the girl with the bleeding cut wounds on her arms and legs, arise before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
Parents and friends don’t tell them anything about what they would think is crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she has made contact with the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Wahn is also a work of art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffering from stroke, they are more likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect the brain is then under-employed and provides for its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she calls daddy since she can think is not her father.
Since the same brain areas are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult to distinguish affected people such as Sarah K. from reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is taking place in the brain, reality is formed there.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, which is why they seem so real."
Nighttime dream pictures also consider boxing as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mental health is able to recognize their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to evaluate hallucinations as a special ability.
Boundary state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our very conscious world, imaginary experience is mostly pathologicalized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also carries positive, creative - madness is also a work of art out of desperation.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of the dreamlikely altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams that the experiencer considers to be real and which he can not distinguish from the waking state afterwards.
The uniroid state of consciousness arises in trauma- or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with loss of self and world, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with a world of its own, imaginative, decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the reality is present in the imagination.
An intense form of foundation and meaning in a situation that is inherently unbearable, which allows us humans to have their own design ability not to go into a void of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness goes on trips for days after a heart valve operation with subsequent heart transplant, while his body is condemned to motionlessness at the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunges into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobles who make drugs out of blood.
Trapped by a Greek on a motorcycle in his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
It is completely up in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different for Clausen from any dream.
A dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are still evident to me after years and in additional details.
Clearer and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience blasts the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroides, psychoses, hallucinations, and drug noise show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also on the watch.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist summarizes, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can be enriching as well.
The snowfall may come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new head of publishing Kallen is an interim solution: in the long run, Hubert Burda wants to put his company in the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding is expected to be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have a firm desire to join the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We have carefully arranged the details for this.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only after that.
Also the question of whether they are able to do so.
You can't hire 7,500 employees if they're not capable enough.
This also affects the children and the company.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he would resign from the chairmanship of the board from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
At first, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the Treasury sector came the responsibility for the company’s assets and after the separation of J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Todenh<0xC3><0xB6>fer also the responsibility for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years," Burda said.
The holding should also be 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
Looking at the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda stated that even family businesses are not sure before the downfall: "This always affected families who were caught up in a capital craving that was completely speculative and thought they could become such a big player.
That was never my strategy.
He had "new world power dreams," Burda said.
I don’t see myself as the political prefect of this country, as it was Springer, and I don’t want to play in the World League with ‘Time’, these stores have become too big.
The Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
This is at least what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is just about body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find among other reputable companies such as Hedonai, which provide a deodorization with laser; Spaxi<0xC3><0xB3>n, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with her.
However, there is also a food department, which stands out by its tea house with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner and have a fantastic view of the capital at the same time, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" with eight girlfriends on your feet and then take a dip in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, on top of that there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training units of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touchscreen that is located opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to perform your training units correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are perfectly sufficient to train the body muscles.
Then, after you have trained your body, you still want to visit the hair salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a space where treatments are offered to regain the hair language, shine and health for your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and that’s why it’s a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and get their party dresses in our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté, of which one can only abrade.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The power company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the "Live Office".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements regarding mobility through management, coordination, subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarise the opinions and actions of the sectors involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
Barcelona, however, is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also taking part in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, activities related to energy and in particular to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and maintains a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees “a horizon of peace” for the automotive sector
The president, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, prophesied of the Spanish automobile industry, which is the country’s largest exporter, “a horizon of peace”.
In presenting the economic report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero once again recalled the actions that the government has initiated to support the automotive sector over the course of the year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we would have today a panorama of the neglect and the shift of some of our main production plants," he said.
“Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry in the future, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry,” he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall Plan for the Automotive Industry (PIA), provided <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800 million for projects from 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion in investment.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended for the development of new models as well as for the modernization of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underscored the Government’s efforts to curb demand, in line with the 2000E plan, which is being applied in cooperation with the autonomous communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of the government, this plan allows to reduce exhaust gases in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in approvals, which increased by "40 percent" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the International Classic Automobile Fair will be held, an exhibition for experts and lovers of the world of motorsport.

Skill tests are also carried out with classic cars and motorcycles on a specially designed race track in the auven area of the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Eco-friendly sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is completely compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start-up system of the engine, named i-Stop, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 stands out due to its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its straw behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are “very good” in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, it can be seen that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good posture.
In addition, the game of steering wheel is excellent.
Looking further at the unit, which consists of the dashboard and the dashboard, it can be seen that Mazda is located with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us in part of the style of the Honda Civic.
That is why it can be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German automobiles, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort, so that four adults can first drive comfortably.
All this comes with a spacious and clearly shaped trunk.
So far, the stop and start system is only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed transmission.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out because of its fineness, its low noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who don’t drive many miles a year should consider this i-stop with a petrol engine because of its great comfort in gearing and its low fuel consumption, even though Mazda’s diesel models are mostly the best-selling.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, as it has a significantly larger number of elements from the series equipment.
From the series equipment, the assistant for the driving track change (RVM) stands out mainly, which eliminates the dead angle, as well as the controls for the traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the air conditioning unit, the sensor unit, the sensor unit.
Moreover, this version also includes, as if this were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which includes the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learnable Bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD charger.
Fazit
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars of its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
On top of that, those who don’t have many miles a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative about this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury model and 23,270 euros for the tried-and-tested Sportive model.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us the new highest driving experience every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensibility for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars shone, dressed in models that look just as elegant as sexy, more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, opted for a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is limited, a device with which you can only read his emails without being able to see certain attachments or be able to surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it selected Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the road is rather improbable, but the idea itself is still of interest especially to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek only costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example only half the price of an iPhone’s flat rate.
After the company saw success with this, it has launched two new devices: one designed only for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free data service, quite unlike the Peek, where you have to pay a six-times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American counterpart, however, it has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel the world with a smartphone already know what it means to miss all the data to be able to read his emails once you have crossed the national border or if you are desperate to find a cafe with WIFI (or a connection option with a phone).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should actually be possible for a long time.
It’s true that some phone providers already offer special contracts and prices for overseas stays, but according to my experience, you already need a doctorate in physics and good glasses to be able to read all the small print.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission of affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe has almost always been ignored.
Beyond your own country, you are always afraid to read his emails and do it right.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (though it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi) can offer this kind of tariffs means that the phone providers need to think slowly but safely and start to consider different ways of taking into account data such as theirs.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
No velcro and no hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, i.e. when buying, and not month by month.
And that’s exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a shopping opportunity with lifelong Internet access as it already offers the Peek in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails by phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetish Color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already at the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and has chosen the same color again to accompany him at his, no doubt, second most important moment in his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: on the other hand, that it was almost the same color - a glossy green -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and for this she wore something roughly embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far as to make it seem at first sight that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the inauguration, she wore a lace dress and a patterned velvet dress in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with semi-high heels and for the second time a delicate model, but gold colors.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was raised as a crown of hair on this occasion, the previous one she wore her hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study "Fruitability and Career of Women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market restricted due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are big differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children there is, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of profession they practice.
Those of them who do not carry out any other activity outside the house, only work half-days or do not have a fixed employment contract, are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a fixed job, especially in the public sector, are moving away from the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
“Women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed job get their first child on average only 3.7 years after mating, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with a fixed job, who took longer to achieve this, and who were mating, and the first child only lost much later.
Moreover, the type of work also has a major impact on motherhood, although less than the calendar in terms of readiness to receive,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account at the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they only have primary school graduation or higher education, were on average 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time mother.
Furthermore, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women with primary school graduation are already getting married before their first graduation and getting their first child, the women with a middle or high school graduation do it exactly differently and first look for a graduation and marry after that and then get their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its all-encompassing list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The main actress from "Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will become another famous poster as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millionaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's playmate in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their top representatives – fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today – met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion, they all appeared.
Ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen as the best model of the year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicen presents in "Poker of the Ace" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) to the thirty X-ray images of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear-influenced genre (short biography, life and work), but instead seeks an excellence to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent saves neither terror nor enlightenment.
Besides that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving call to read and read over and over again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
Albert Camus: "In reading his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt, without having found words for it: the joy as opposed to the ill-fated fate, the moral without guilt, and the unscrupulousness without God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with an overwhelming poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blades that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was drawn by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, those in her ban, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery united themselves with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that existed in coming to Heaven on Earth."
About James Joyce: "The Odyssey" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 summits in the world literature, you have to climb up the north wall, on the wall where the best mountain climbers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "It was a funny mess.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir to a property owner of the county and again other times he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams were a sign of a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the insane cry, which was carved out of a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo would hold on to his literary way until deep into the night of the 20th century.
About Dorothy Parker: “One day she knelt down and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I finally stop writing like a woman.”
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses are engraved by Spencer: 'Sleep after effort, / after the thunder of the harbor, / the peace after war, / after a full life you find pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII spied them between the Azaleas or sang the birds in Greek.
There is not a single other case known where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent was still much greater than her madness."
About P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do other than try to inflate Joyce in Baroja?
What, then, did Benet intend to do if he did not lead Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he could put himself on this podium?"
Feige Aggression
My 70-year-old mother went for a walk last week through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old walked out next to her and our dog, our dog is a mix that we picked up from the animal house and he just weighed six kilos of hemp and then heheed it out.
Our comfort cannot be taken into account at all, since it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun should be in the event of a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was carried out on the line.
In addition to this, the stabbing attack that a woman who was walking comfortably got when she wanted to justify these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he will be the same person as a woman, a gentleman, a gentleman, a gentleman.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o’clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has been barking all day.
Of course, we returned an advertisement at a nearby police station, but we still have great doubts whether this will bring anything at all and in order to avoid any prejudices from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our dismay over what happened has caused us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what has to happen in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don’t know where good education and respect for animals and people has remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "covers far more than just designing and manufacturing products that are becoming more and more secure with each passing day" and further confirmed that they are also contributing to this goal with other actions of an educational and informative character.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters in a first phase to over 500 motorcycle workshops to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, it always commits itself to the fact that one of its main goals must be the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks is on the rise again
After almost two years, the small car market finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles approved in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in relation to the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are thus the first increase even after 22 consecutive months of continuous decline, according to the manufacturer’s association Anfac and the car dealer association.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution, since the reference data used for comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly bad year with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total approvals of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all the vehicles that make up the small transporter market: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small delivery cars and lighter trucks/carriers.
Furthermore, the same weather clouds in the sky are still the ones that are most in demand, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the majority of the sales go to small and medium-sized companies that make the purchase with a third-party financing in almost 100% of all cases.
In this way, further factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the prolongation of the bad economic situation have to be included in these restrictions, which are the result of the targeted money laundering of credit institutions.
In this panorama and unlike passenger cars, the financial support in purchasing a vehicle of the Plan 2000E has helped little.
This plan, however, is not only intended for private individuals, but also self-employed and small businesses have a right to buy if they want to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emissions that may not exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam recalled that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The car dealer association predicted for 2010 a similar year to the one just past, for which it expects a sales loss (in passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Support for brake manoeuvring in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system at the time, and as is currently the case with the stability control ESP, the auxiliary braking systems must become mandatory equipment in European cars in case of an emergency.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly approved passenger cars and light mini-carriers, for which the rest of the vehicles a Karenz deadline was set until the end of February 2011.
The European Union's decision to take the bait is aimed at improving the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many accidents due to their way of working.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake maneuver, which detects the system on the brake pedal based on the brake strength performed by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer able to step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not fully braked.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The braking aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force into the braking system, thereby reducing the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car lags behind during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assist.
There would be even fewer accidents – one expects that one in four accidents could be prevented by personal injury – as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (through radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while already exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds to this, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones plans for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, according to the timetable of the American car, the American automaker has indicated that
Nick Reilly, GM Europe’s new chairman, wants to make sure that the affected party gives their consent to every single point of the plan already in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will make a decision in the coming days regarding the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American automaker to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports car, which has back cover from the Russian group Converg, is gaining ever stronger claim.
If there was no agreement with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be upheld.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, which now brings only 1,275 kilos to the scale.
To create something like this, they were the first to dispense with the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a curtain roof with manual drive, so that alone 21 kilos were saved; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model, as the GT3 had "disappeared" another 15; by the removal of the air conditioner, the car was replaced by the car, and the car was replaced by the car.
Then again, six kilos less had been lost due to the abandonment of the CDR-30 audio system and the replacement of the door handles by handles made of fabric reached the missing kilo.
Although it is also available with the double clutch transmission PDK, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with 6-speed manual transmission, mainly on the smaller California country roads, on mountain tracks that ran really very curvy.
In his driving behavior, you can only give him the score flawlessly.
However, the reduction of his weight did not in any way lead to the fact that he would no longer be so sure of lying on the pavement.
It is rather the opposite of the case: for a long time we have not tried such a small and light model, which at the same time gives you a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low pace in the required time, until we give him the commands to race, slow down, recover and then again get everything out of his engine...
The car does everything we tell it to do with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is just as communicative and precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and can be increased with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is unimaginably brutal, whether from standing up or when accelerating again.
The springs are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the punch holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole route; and that, although we found some of these curves of ice in the morning gray and rolling splits in the morning.
To sum up, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving experience, as it is probably more rare to have it, and in it there is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be launched in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 euros.
"The Bag Girl"
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Cocoon cosmetics line and an opportunity starlet at the fashion shows of 'Maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck stiffness as her Chanel bags.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many missed players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes to the first place in his group after the great performance of Mirza Beste dretovic (his great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of effort and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter out with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the Blues, who were at the top of the board from the start.
As the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria had already come out of the perimeter, it was already possible to note that they had come to the field with well-heated hand joints.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly any different, except that the team from <0xC3><0x81>lava opted for an inside game from Barac and for the game from Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to further expand his advantage to the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" rating of Splitter already love to admit that this would not be the best night of the Brazilian.
Despite the obvious advantage in the break, however, the game had not yet been decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians once again that not everyone wins on their playing field, and thanks to the constantly attacking "hand of Elijah" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "Yellows" turning the rudder (50-49).
Even More Disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured, but everything other than dead, had to prepare a few moves with match-safety to get air again, and one of them suddenly came the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas, was able to depose a third of the gazer (with the help of English and Ribas).
The Alaves were blown up in the last quarter and English and San Emetrio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take back the victory they had honestly earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team back power by three points off the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although Splitter was suspended due to fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis recovered in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in Group B of the Euroleague to him, and that in a game marked by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the internal game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The team from M<0xC3><0xA1>laga was not afraid of the atmosphere in the hall of peace and friendship nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their offer in the first quarter, the Andalusians were able to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts blended with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja celebration, although the local team with an inside game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show the ad table in the 13th minute 22-20 in their favor, the minute in which it was due to an action to disqualification between William and the Weaver.
The Greek team began to get warm and his superiority on both halves of the game, while the Englishman Joel Freeland's dismissal due to an injury and the three self-made mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear marks on the Unicaja.
Among their players in the infield and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A recovery hunt was impossible
The third quarter was marked by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, who were superior despite his 19 losses and even managed to equalize the difference of the game played in M<0xC3><0xA1>laga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn caused the lead within the group to fluctuate.
Unicaja tried to get away with the many failures and exclusion of the Scotsman Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute, thanks to the lead and the triples of Cook and the use of Lewis, some hope came again on 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, as the Olympiacos, once attacked and showed his superiority with centimetres within the basket area, was not to be braked.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute to raise the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to give up and had to give up the lead on Olympiacos.
How much should you earn from your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now earn their salary based on their profile thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most listings of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain.
The “How Much Should You Earn?” tool calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users can enter a form on Facebook, in which they can enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average “feels poorly paid,” explains the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a French 31,059 euros, as opposed to the 24,000 euros a Spaniard earns.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net income of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid work in Spain is the net work of a waiter with 11,592 euros per year, followed by the work of a salesman with 14,725 euros and the work of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after places on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President removed from office must leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010 at the latest when his mandate expires
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that before that date he must have left the embassy in which he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he will have to leave on January 27 as his mandate expires on that day and he will have to look for a new accommodation."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the deadline: “My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the back cover of the Brazilian government,” Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, he tried to get refuge in Brazil this week.
This, however, failed to acknowledge Zelaya's refusal to recognize the status of an asylum seeker, whom the "de facto" government wanted to impose on him under the chairmanship of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when the inflation of the assets was the prevailing mood in the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker makes decisions about a natural choice.
The leverage used to stabilize the markets was to pay off the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to let the liquidity go hand in hand at interest rates that move around the zero so that the banks can buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost complete and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, begin to spread some sand into the gear, as the ECB already predicted with its annual auction next week.
That is why investors are doubting the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The volatility of exchanges and the differences in corporate bonds are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to state the private risks and the public debt was on the rise again.
We are now focusing on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the Eurozone with respect to Germany.
Spain had so far hardly been affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new downward revision regarding Spain's rating.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of moral risk, who had once again tried to raise awareness among those responsible for world economic policy, for what they had caused, as they had to resort to the destructive effects which they had to resort to, and to which they had to resort to, the restriction of their work.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the Emirs in order to restore power in the Emirates and development in Greece was also foreseen earlier.
A government that conceals the state debt, elections, and a new government that pulls on the same strand.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal to Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense that at the beginning of the year Ecofin Hungary saves from the non-fulfillment of its foreign payments and thus allows a euro-member country to no longer comply with its obligations.
On the other hand, it makes sense that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens under the obligation to maintain the stability of the state funds in case of the need for extraordinary hijackings.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalization of the risk premiums, after some deferrals to too high amounts, that would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same speed as the European corporate bonds.
If, however, the European differences were to decrease and the Spanish continued to increase, then this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the above-mentioned indicators force a large part of market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and correct their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission, they do not make any progress towards a Japanese economy again.
Again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stocks, although at the moment "precaution while driving" is suggested.
Contiguous branches
Iberdrola’s chairman, Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, made his first appearance yesterday before Parliament’s subcommittee, where the strategy on Spain’s energy supply will be debated in the next two decades.
After his appearance, which was followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n gave the press some points about what he had submitted to the Subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion by 2020 and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion by 2030, on the condition that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
Should this not be the case, the required investments would not amount to 60 billion, but would amount to up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that one should no longer invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
By 2020, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, above all on renewable energies.
In this case, it is assumed that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the precondition of course through other "support energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who is of the opinion that the draft law for a sustainable economy, which has just been passed by the government, in line with what his company has demanded, did not want to say anything against this law to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be the exact opposite of the strategy of all politicians.
In his opinion, "in the long term, this direction is clearly put in place, despite some "single" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called it.
Be it the way it is, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n thinks that decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, should be made already now, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework needs to be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" from Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for services at airports on the ground, Swiss sport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for the luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, to which no figures have yet been announced, has been concluded for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares signed a protocol on cooperation to create an innovation center for intelligent infrastructures yesterday.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5-kilometer-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The city administration wants the construction to be completed by the end of 2014.
After the Administration for Public-Private Cooperation (PPP) had decided to move the project forward according to a business plan set up by Ernst & Young, the Administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly made up of European construction companies, competing against each other in the last phase.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists for underground construction.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium is formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructure and the French Bouygues group.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrower election, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), which also owns the local builder’s stone (in German owned by the German group of companies) and the company of the German company Ralfinger.
The Australian market for infrastructure promises enormous construction work and privatisation, but it has a hurdle to overcome, as you only get access through the purchase of a local construction company.
A strategy that the mentioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger followed, in addition to Asian references, and which the Spanish construction giants have yet to pursue.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona is of the utmost importance to the industry in this geographical area, where it is already well known for its activities as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest wind farm (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage the Adelaide desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate itself in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll route, which is funded by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and named Northern Link (Nordzubringer), has the purpose of passing the western highway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometers through the tunnel.
The timetable issued by the city administration foresees the allocation for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this toll route is expected to open for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland is contributing 500 million Australian dollars (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) to the funding.
Brisbane is already a big business for Hochtief.
Australia is awarding significant contracts to Hochtief, who signed a 154 million contract with the government yesterday.
Through its local subsidiary Leighton, ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This improvement will create a fast internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the 27-storey King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million for this purpose.
Also in the UK, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
Initial investments amount to 75 million euros.
FCC Receives Order for a Tunnel in Slovenia for 64 Million
Through its subsidiary Alpine, the FCC has acquired the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometers in length for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it received a grant for the construction work to expand the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria) to over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
Construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore Receives Advertising Statement from Renfe
Renfe has allocated the advertising and marketing services for the next two years of the agency, Mrs. Rushmore, for an amount of approximately three million euros per year, the railway company said.
In this contract, there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months in each case. Mrs. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that presented to this competition that Renfe announced, 4 of which came in the final round, among them TBWA, who was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
More than 63 million fines for France Télécom for breach of competition.
France Télécom has imposed a fine of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to the authority, the phone provider has restricted competition on landline and mobile by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the edge of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned enterprises have collected more than 560 million euros in penalties since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased as the authority guarding the competition is of the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and has therefore become retroactive again.
Application trading
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading site on the Internet for the purpose of increasing revenue from transactions that do not originate from the telephone connection.
Basically, this application site of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
It is necessary to wait until 2010 for these sites to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The Champions League game has brought Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a in 476.4 million since the beginning.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has become a source of revenue for the football club.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken in 476.4 million, bringing them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of revenue for the major clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since its inception in the 1992/93 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The Wei<0xC3><0x9F>e Club is in third place in Europe, which has earned the most money through its participation and the only one besides AC Milan to have won the trophy three times.
The reigning Catalan champion and the last winner of the 1992 European Cup placed fifth.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also made the most money from their participation in the previous Champions League.
And that, even though they lost to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only third in the countries that could take money from the champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, as opposed to four in Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution (disambiguation)
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
In this fiscal year, the organization, chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenues of 1,090 million by the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA expects 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualifying round (among them Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
On top of that, those who struggled to participate got 3.8 million through their blob presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and for a draw (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 per team). The clubs that have reached the eighth final will receive three million each; the four that have reached the quarterfinals will receive 3.3 million.
The last four get $4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a, in turn, earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Super Cup in August.
However, there are also the variable payments, for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is allocated in proportion to the value of each individual television market.
The Spaniard is among the first and has 4 places allocated.
Last year’s champion received 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday searched for details on the purchase offer of shares, with which it wants to acquire an upper limit of between 25 and 29.9% of Sos’s capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share, which is paid out over ten years and with a interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below market value.
According to Nuvan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos again.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz Group gives shareholders a 15-day period to disclose their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed about this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the authority.
At completion, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay on the verge of possible purchase offers and the court-martials of his former managers, the brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as head of the internal book review.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created post, which is directly subordinated to the chairman of the group.
This is anything but polemic-free because the company is engaged in a legal battle over the suspicion of diverting more than 230 million sos to other Salazar family companies.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will move additional capital over the next few months.
With regard to the Salazar’s credit, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the move of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves Paterina’s public exclusion tender submitted by Investmentgesellschaft Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public auction for Federico Paterina submitted by investment company Mer on 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been shown that the conditions comply with the laws in force and thus the content of the submitted explanatory note, following the amendments made on 2 December, can be considered as "sufficient".
CNMV also informed that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paterina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which in turn is 8.95% of the share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 euros in shares approved on the exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
Moreover, it was also reported that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the conclusion of the tender, and the price of which was fixed by Federico Paterina in accordance with the law.
New programmes for the evaluation of vehicles
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the KFZ workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are hauled into the workshops where an expert has to assess the damage and cost of repair.
No single accident is the same and calculating the cost of the parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest IT tools, it is a matter of minutes
That’s why almost 100% of reviewers use this type of system.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repair collect the information they receive from the manufacturers in order to process them afterwards and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all reviews are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing with GtMotive and Eurotax in the tool market for review and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, sales manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, to the point that even more versions, variants and motorizations have come on the market in the last five years than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a laborious task, because each individual of the abert thousand vehicle parts must be catalyzed and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image, on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure proceeds quickly.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months, and currently 99.2% of cars sold in Spain have complete information.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the car park on the roads, it is more than 99%.
For the purpose of documenting and producing databases, Audatex has eight distribution centers worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics specialists) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Every month, they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every second day.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the error or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about a driver about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When reviewing the products offered by Audatex, you can easily get an overview of the type of support they provide to the industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the AudaPlus products being a standard solution for assessing accidents for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid according to the purpose of use, i.e. for each review.
The most expensive is for customers who rarely use it, a maximum of ten times a month, i.e. 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that produces thousands of reviews negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly band, using the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass deals with vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is an Internet service open to the specialist market, which can be used to provide vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Your statistics service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or for the purpose of obtaining information about the deviations by brand and model.
For example, it is possible to investigate how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and in the same way delivers digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group that was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT-guide for reviews is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 reviewers and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased by 20% annually over the last three years and in 2008 sales amounted to EUR 10,8 million.
At the beginning of last year, they started to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is carried out in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America, working with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Total sales in the world of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) are $557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Trafficking of Accidental Cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought an online platform for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value-added, with the ability to gain access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchasing service is exclusively for industry professionals, such as insurance companies, accountants, car rental companies, workshops, landfills and car dealers who need to be registered before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them alone in Germany.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day, 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been registered may no longer drive on the roads, but certain parts that are not damaged may be used as spare parts.
Cars of historical value, on the other hand, may be re-approved even if they have been cancelled after difficult government operations.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a basic condition, especially to convince the older professionals who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger motor vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 small hauliers and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for the working hours, uptime or discounts, and after that he can print out the cost estimate and pass it on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for evaluation like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that there is no estimated working hours allocated to the workshop.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can pay without further delay.
Currently, the company Audatex is working on being able to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that automechanics have been waiting for for a long time, because with it, for example, you can choose a door and then completely turn the picture around to look at the inside.
