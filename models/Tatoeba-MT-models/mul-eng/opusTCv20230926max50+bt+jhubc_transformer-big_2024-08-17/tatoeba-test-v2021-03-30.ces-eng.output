Tantalum is a chemical element with the tag Ta.
The cat has nine lives.
How could you betray me like this after all we've been through?
Why would Tom leave?
My door is always open.
I bought two boxes of lighters.
You didn't hurt anyone, did you?
Be careful with the child.
Would you like that?
I'm paying for that coffee.
Don't lose hope.
I don't want to lose that weight.
Tom betrayed Mary.
Call her tomorrow.
I didn't see that.
Tom and Mary were dirty.
They're playing around the house.
I don't know why I'm still in trouble.
I'm not as powerful as I used to be.
Tom's dog bites a few birds.
Don't forget, Tom's blind.
Mary seemed to be getting married.
There's no taste buds.
When Tom returned home last night, he found that he had no dinner left.
He knows them.
I'm sure they're very proud of their daughter.
Tom started to drive, and Mary went to the other side.
There's one left.
He began to explain what had happened.
Tom has a stomach made of cast iron, he can eat almost anything.
The mother did not know what to do with her son.
He knows wine.
Tom felt someone patting him on the shoulder.
Do you know who the parents are?
No words will tell you how wonderful you are.
I'd like fruit juice.
Will it rain tomorrow?
The Klinic script invented by Sumerians was used in many languages in the ancient Middle East.
I love summer, but I can't stand it.
Of course it is!
Mary loves you.
What do you think?
What does tattoo mean?
Where have you been all afternoon?
You found a nice guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
She washed her dirty hands before eating.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left high-pitched on the table.
It's not over a glass of beer after a day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
So far I am satisfied with my work.
Do you really need help?
To be you, I'll ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here's a map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting, even though they invited me.
Are you still here?
I thought you were dating Tom.
I have to get to the next station.
That dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you paid a lot for the car.
Tom's obviously lying.
So straight and then transport and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'll still have to call you.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom's going to be 13 tomorrow.
Cut the meat into thin slices.
I can't watch my life being ruined.
Do everything with balance.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
Yes, you must.
We climbed to the top of Mount Fuji.
My wife and I want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember what it was like?
That belt is too tight for me.
Playing bass is not easy.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated with a hint on the subject.
We drink a lot of beer.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
The old customs are dying fast today.
Tom still has a lot of work to do.
You'd better get out now.
Tom is childless.
I like to read.
We cut the rope.
I don't like to interrupt you, I just came to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because a fallen tree was lying on the tracks.
What did Tom scream at the crowd?
She's the perfect husband for me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to parties in 17th-century costumes.
Are you satisfied with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I used to admire Tom.
He climbed a tree with great effort.
It is very difficult to translate the Czech text.
Tom's probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom stood there, too.
We already know that, Tom.
I'm glad you warned me about it.
I missed breakfast.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I won't be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skill qualifies him for this job.
They're falling.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't dare tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They're not helping.
I like that tie.
We didn't behave as well as we'd like.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back tonight.
You had a fight with Joan?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The sky is covered with black clouds.
I need it more than you do.
You bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll stay here forever.
Tom took his clitoris.
What should I do in this situation?
Are you going to school by train?
Tom won't be at school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who is Tom visiting?
It could be Tom, not Mary.
What if you asked me out for a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I won't be surprised if it happens.
He's free.
People don't normally say that.
Ask your mother.
Tom washed his feet carefully.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was happy as a fool when she got a recording contract.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time at his computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you were to help us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He visits his uncle.
Everybody's out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary did.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anyone live in such a place?
It's been raining for two days.
I know exactly what's going on.
Have you ever sung in French?
I'm used to this cold weather.
The Americans surprised the Germans.
There are not enough chairs in the conference room.
Tom didn't answer.
I told Tom he was a fake friend and he got hurt.
Peru clothes.
This bridge was a taxed bridge.
He was staring at her.
I was late for school this morning.
I took part in the search.
I went straight to bed.
We were shot in the grass by the river.
Tom never had a hard drink.
Tom doesn't like to work.
My heart is French, but my ass is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know what it is.
Tom grabbed Mary's hand.
I'm completely happy alone.
You did what you had to do.
We have to understand that we are still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played with Mary tennis yesterday.
What's your dad's name?
There was a half-timbered wall.
I spoke to him in English and found out I could make a deal.
Tom had to run.
I see the book.
Have any of you ever talked to Tom?
You should apologize.
That fence's freshly laid.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You've lost weight.
We're supposed to win.
All answers must be written according to the instructions.
Answer me some questions.
They'd all be happy if Tom left and didn't come back.
Did you bring the book?
I don't like to open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother is from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting divorced.
I bought a bag.
Do you know where your father comes from?
What the hell are you?
Did you approve of it?
There was absolutely no doubt.
This letter is personal, I don't want anyone else to read it.
As far as I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything bad about Tom.
Get up there and you'll see better.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
When we saw what Tom was wearing, we got a laugh.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
It's better to be dead than to live in red.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you could do it for me.
Tom knows what he's saying.
The wedding took place last week.
I'll eat more.
The horse's barking.
I loaned it to Tom.
I'm bored.
I'm writing my will.
I'm not such a bat anymore.
You won't believe what Tom just told me.
Mary has no one to talk to, but she doesn't feel lonely.
If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we'll go to the shed.
Try talking to the police.
You like elephants.
I don't want to change anything.
Bartender, I'll have a drink.
Do you like berries?
She was bigger.
I assume he's gone home.
I was in the woods.
Tom's drunk.
He asked me to wait there before he came back.
I made a terrible decision.
I'd rather go back inside.
She doesn't have to.
I know she's pretty.
I'm not going to school on Sunday.
She has her own house.
I usually don't do it tonight.
Why do you want me to ask them for help when we can do it ourselves?
I was waiting for them to tell the truth.
Put it under the cornice.
I'm so glad you're here.
She's a pain in the ass.
Tom didn't want to lose Mary.
Tom's home.
Throw the ball to Tom.
I hate her.
Was the police involved in this?
We like kids.
I wish I was a better person.
You're stealing, aren't you?
Tom has to learn.
You should consult a lawyer in advance.
You're a good journalist.
That's what Tom's used to.
I love this book.
The waste is melted again.
When I got home from work, I found out that someone had stolen our apartment.
Read the book.
This used to be a bakery.
My father runs a restaurant.
You're really boring.
I like silent movies.
This works.
Let go of me.
I'd like to make more money.
I know you're still not satisfied.
Can this report be true?
Easy to buy, easy to forget.
Do you remember seeing me before?
I want to help, but I'm busy right now.
Without her help, I would never have passed this test.
You wouldn't be happier if I told you.
Are you able to translate from French to English?
A lot of people were waiting for him.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning on going swimming with us.
Oh, my God, Tom, what the hell is this?
The audience seemed impotent.
If you need further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.
When you get here, I'll be asleep.
I don't know how old Tom is.
I'd like you to come with me.
I told Tom it wasn't over yet.
Judy likes him.
Tom and Mary met with John.
Please don't do that.
You'll be happy again.
The child fell after four.
Tom doesn't take his medication.
"Didn't you see my cell phone?" "He's on the table."
Tom went to his locker.
The first jump was wrong.
Well, let's have lunch.
We should give him a gift.
In England, the waiter asked us, ‘How many beers would you have, half a pint, or a whole?’ Because we had no idea how much it might be, we asked him to show us the glasses.
I'll tell Tom to cut your lawn.
I'd rather have English than music.
I like fish.
They're all screaming.
