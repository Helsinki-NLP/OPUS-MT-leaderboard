Crying in the World
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gone well and cries and calls out in the wild are beginning to attract people wide and wide around the world.
“You own the collective idea, I need Iceland,” says a woman outside the big world in comments from the marketing campaign “Looks Like You Need Iceland” on the YouTube website.
Another viewer says goodbye will keep Iceland in his heart for all eternity and a young woman says straight-line must first arrive in Iceland after the end of her stay there.
Unfortunately, however, she is in the United States and suggests that she will have to wait a few more months.
Another viewer asks if the walkway to Iceland is possible, because there are no airplanes.
The story does not follow whether he comes from another era.
Egill <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>rd<0xC3><0xA1>rson of the advertising agency Peel, who made the ads together with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, said the reception had been more hopeful.
“I’ve come across a lot of Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well but this new campaign is already starting to hit the mark.
Basically, it’s about creating PR value, it’s getting foreign media to talk about the campaign, and it’s been going incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media outlets around the world, reaching a total of two billion people.
The value of this conversion is estimated at SEK 1.8 billion.
It's not awkward."
The main market of all is the United States and the campaign has gone very well there even though the United States is not on its way to the country soon.
According to Egils, well-known market areas such as Denmark, the United Kingdom and Germany have also been well-received, such as Russia, which comes as a pleasant surprise.
Then there have been responses from foreign regions, such as India, which was not particularly laid out.
“These ads have traveled far beyond what we’ve come to expect,” Egil says, but more than four million people may have watched the content on YouTube.
“We couldn’t have wished for a better start.”
The pictures here at the opening were taken by <0xC3><0x81>rni S<0xC3><0xA6>berg, the photographer of Morgunbla<0xC3><0xB0>in, we take on the ads that bear the headline "Let It Out" about the middle of the last month.
The tests were carried out wide and wide, such as at the School Fairs in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k, in Reynisfj<0xC3><0xB6>r, at Sk<0xC3><0xB3>garfoss, at S<0xC3><0xB3>lheimaj<0xC3><0xB6>kli and in the hall at Hj<0xC3><0xB6>rleifsh<0xC3><0xB6>f<0xC3><0xB0>a.
The film was directed by Sam<0xC3><0xBA>el Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar P<0xC3><0xA1>ll <0xC3><0x93>lafsson at Skoti productions and directed by <0xC3><0x93>ttar Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason.
In the lead roles were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who are from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders made the announcements, but at the same time the recording took place in the South was another group in the West and Westfjords.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first track in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but is scheduled to be a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first step in this work for Icelanders,” says Egil, adding that the cooperation with M&C Saatchi has worked very well.
“It’s great to work with them.
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking about."
Speakers: Discuss the status of the labour market, livelihoods and much more
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Da<0xC3><0xB0>ason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children’s Affairs, will meet in Sprengisand starting at 10 a.m. on the Bylgjn today.
He is also the Minister of Labour and discusses the status of the labour market as such, the Icelandair issue and more.
He also discusses land construction issues and transportation works out in countries that have gone badly and have been divided over the last years and decades.
Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r Ing<0xC3><0xB3>lfsson, chairman of VR, will also be present in the episode, but he will discuss his views on the investment of life funds and present ideas that the business movement and professional accountants are pulling themselves out of the management of the funds to reduce profits.
Then they will be discussed with <0xC3><0x8D>var Ingimarsson, the travel agent in the East, and <0xC3><0x81>rnhei<0xC3><0xB0>i J<0xC3><0xB3>hannsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, the CEO of the Nordic Market Office, about the status of travel services in the country.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a false prediction of what is to come.
You can listen to the episode below before it starts at 10 a.m.
This is what it looks like 25 years later.
The actress Elisa Donovan had a famous career in the youth roles of any kind.
However, she gained worldwide fame for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch, Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
Little has happened to her in the past, but she managed to look across the street and express herself about Clueless on Australian television in the days.
She speaks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“I have to admit that I built the most persona on girls I met in schools that weren’t good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who that person was," Donovan said of his play at Clueless.
I didn't want to leave the police station after a night out.
About fifty cases came to the police in the capital area today, and the police diary says that the case has been varied.
The day at the Hverfisgata police station began with the police having to deal with a man who had recently been released from prison after staying there due to the structure of the beer.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the orders of the police who told him to leave.
The man won a permanent stay at the police station because of his passing.
A man was arrested this morning on suspicion of breaking into a company in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavogi.
Police were also required to have a replacement of two men in Brei<0xC3><0xB0>holt due to reports of a body attack.
It also came to the conclusion that a woman who was sitting at a mall in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavogi was unable to pay for the account at the end of the meal and was therefore called to the police.
There were also reports of a car crash in the city this morning.
The driver whitened Renault's dispatcher looking for her for a moment, and she was then taken by an inexhaustible hand.
The car was not found.
Gle<0xC3><0xB0>isveitan's Blog - The Horrible Fate of the Gleestrians
That theory has reached a flight on the Internet to curse rest over the drama series about Halloween, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days and became the third protagonist of the series to let life long before age.
The Glee series is a popular drama about singing, dancing, and joy.
The series focused on the so-called joys of young people in school, their love and destiny.
It was not always taken out with the pleasure of being in the entertainment industry, but through singing and dancing, the characters seemed to overcome every circumstance that came into their lives.
But outside the theatre, there has been a lot of panic over the actors and the actors, so much so that the lessons have awakened the curse of rest on the actors.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Sant<0xC3><0xB3>na Lopez in the episodes, a trickster who did not call his entire grandmother.
After the series had ended, Rivera went on to own actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently dismissed them.
However, Dorsey refused to make a statement and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8, it was reported that Riveru had been missing after her four-year-old son was found stranded alone on a boat in Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a lifeboat on board the boat and was able to report to the police that he and his mother had drowned and that Rivera had brought him back to the boat but never returned there herself.
Start an extensive search to Rivera.
The day after the search began, the police officer in the area began to report that we had been searching since Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially pronounced dead.
It is believed that she has fallen into great currents in the water and used her last requirement to save her son.
The Danish cause of death was recorded as drunk by ambulances.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson, the American football player with the Anglo-Saxons who played a key role in bringing the Glades to the road and honours.
Without the scenes, however, Moneith lingered with the personal devil.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to get away from it.
In 2013, his co-workers found enough in the episodes, intervened and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to treatment and everything seemed to look a better way.
Just two months after he finished treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banemin was found to be a lethal mixture of vitamins and alcohol.
It was not meant to be a will.
Moneith had been treated and his patience with the drug had decreased so much that the dose he had previously endured well proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His legacy weighed heavily on his collaborators, but at the base of his opponent, Lea Michele, was determined to continue taking the roles and they dedicated the entire part to the memory of Moneith and his character Finns.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the episodes, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his peers at the Fun Show, or until he gained the heart to admit that he enjoyed dancing and singing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home on suspicion of child custody.
At home, he found a huge amount of children’s clothing and the matter was soon publicly questioned.
It was clear that Salling had already been there.
He was subsequently charged and prosecuted for his crimes.
He was to be sentenced to four to seven years in prison, as well as being required to be on the list of sex offenders and seeking treatment for child sex.
Before the judge had decided the punishment, Salling, who was then free from insurance, was found dead near his home.
The Danish cause was self-evident.
It wasn’t just the actors who fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He became a sleep apnoea in 2013, only 41 years old.
We also won a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of star Julius Roberts, and her sister did not celebrate the story, but she sued Roberts for great governance and demeanor.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she succumbed to severe depression.
She handed over a letter to her husband, saying that her mother and sister, among other things, were responsible for how she got there.
“My mother and so-called sister get nothing from me except the memory that they were the worst depression of mine.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been asked to spend her classmates’ leisure time and transitions at the dockyard and to have a superstitious star count.
Jesse Luken played a guest role in the series in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with murder in 2019, which seemed to be a lot of excitement.
The actress Heather Morris played a big role in the episodes.
In 2010, it became clear that the unscrupulous computer trios came in nectar images of her and appeared on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the episodes and had a love affair outside the episodes.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had used her violence in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything.
It increases the growth of children when they get to play outside in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and get to watch them grow and reproduce.
It is also infinitely possible to make with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having time with the kids in the park is something you never forget.
They will remember the flowers, the flowers, and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
He bought a boat after the 10th grade.
“I don’t think we’re many sailors who work in the country’s playgrounds,” says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, who spends beach holidays in the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland over the winter.”
Beachwear is a very comfortable summer job when you are in school.
If you fish well, you can have a good income and I think it’s great to be able to drop out of school.
The signs also fit me well into the winter,” says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist, who runs a beach dive in the summer like last summer.
Axel was the latest to dock at Talknafj<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>ur when a reporter got a speech from him late at night at the beginning of the week."
“The wind that I was in the tenth grade, I took command of a boat that is under 12 meters tall and I bought my boat the summer after I graduated from elementary school.
I’ve been on the beach all the time.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartman J<0xC3><0xB3>nsson, and I named the boat his name.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and ceased to be at sea and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer but the other half at the end of the summer when I had finished fishing.
So I had the boat without debt at the end of my first summer on it.”
But how could a boy have one and a half million dollars to pay for a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
“I had been putting in and collecting money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I was all kind of fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my farm money in my boat fund.”
Axel was born in <0xC3><0x8D>safir<0xC3><0xB0>i, where all his mother is, but he has lived in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavogi since he was a boy.
“I can hunt here in the western region because I have a legal residence with my grandmother in Iceland.
I learned in this area for the west of a row with my dad.
I move between distances depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers all of the Westworld.
Although I think it’s best to be in the West, I’ve also given around Sn<0xC3><0xA6>fellsnesit and beyond.
I’ve also provided for the south, but most of all for the grass,” says Axel, who always touches one fireman in the morning and sometimes talks to his stomach and sings for the sky, in the lonely hours together outside the ballpark.
“The internet connection out at sea is good, so I can call, listen to radio shows and music.
I don’t want to be alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid landing in the highlands, but certainly, something has been on the weather for a while, but never a big risk," says Axel, who is lucky that he is never a seaman.
He says the length of the workday depends on how the hunters walk each time.
“I’ve never spent more than 14 hours fishing at a time on the beach, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example, in the rental quota, but then I’ve been continuously for one and a half hours fishing outside the sea.”
According to the beach guide, he is able to catch 770 kilos a day, which he feels is a hindrance.
“Other obstacles are that I can’t hunt on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I can only hunt for twelve days a month, these four months that the coast guard will be over, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their hunting days after the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is for people to rest instead of having 48 days all summer and can choose their own head.
So the division of the region could also go because of me, and the marine space that is well located with the fish should enjoy it," says Axel, who draws the most from the salt seas on its shores, but also only shallow and unique other species float with.
Axel works over the winter with a university student at the N<0xC3><0xBA>pi Play School in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavog.
“I don’t think we’re a lot of sailors working in the country’s playgrounds,” says Axel, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the playground.
“I’m excited because I feel like this is a great job.
I hope that the psychology course will benefit me at the gymnasium in the future,” says Axel, who has also come a long way with a degree in business science.
Villa in registration was prevented for home visits
The villa in the registration form that people fill out when it comes to the country became so that a person, residing here in the country, was not called back to the exhibition.
There is no requirement to register a certificate if the relevant form is filled out in English, as is when it is done in Icelandic.
“This will be examined this week,” says a specialist in the field of anticonvulsants.
Three domestic cases were detected at the Department of Virology of the Landsp<0xC3><0xAD>talans yesterday.
One of those who proved to be positive came to the country on 15 July, two days after the rules on the so-called homecoming contract came into force.
Those who were living in Iceland were then drafted at the arrival of the country and again announced in the screening four to five days later.
In the afternoon news, R<0xC3><0x9A>V reported that the person concerned had, on the other hand, followed the old system.
The sample at the border was negative and he was not called back to the screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfusd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, a specialist in the field of emergency medical services, says in a press conference that this could lead to an error in the electronic registry.
Filling people out the registration form in English is not a requirement to insert a textbook like and is in the Icelandic version.
First of all, it was designed for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person concerned did not receive an automatic invitation to take part in the demonstration.
Kamilla, however, says many have followed the rules on home visits although they have filled out the registration form in English and in some cases, employers have also been alerted to sending people back to the screening after it came to the country.
“It will be reviewed this week on how to facilitate people’s access to this to attract its attention in the process.”
The man is in solitary confinement, and six have been put in solitary confinement.
They all went to the screening, but two of them were starting to show symptoms.
Infection is now underway with the three infections detected yesterday, but it is mostly closed due to two infections reported as of Friday.
In both cases, the sequence analysis of Icelandic genetic analysis has shown that there is a variant of the coronavirus that has not been found here before.
In the second case, the ban has pointed out that Israel, although it is known that the person who transported the virus to the country had also travelled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be for tomorrow where the virus would come from.
There are now 15 in isolation according to the website COVID. ice.
135 are in circulation.
Four out of five uninfected
Five domestic cases have been identified here in the country in the past few days.
Of these, four are completely unrelated and are to be found the origin of the infection that appeared at the Rey Cup sporting event yesterday.
Snoring is still prevalent.
Originally, the third dozen were individually sent to the clinic, but they were reduced to sixteen.
In total, 34 people are infected due to these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that an infection is detected at a sporting event and it has raised questions about whether to hold such an event.
J<0xC3><0xB3>hann K. J<0xC3><0xB3>hannsson, communications director at the Public Safety Department of the National Police, says it very slowly, as long as people follow the rules and conditions.
“We are constantly praying for all those who live here that there is a need to maintain individualized immunity.
We also need to tell people who are holding events that there are certain rules in place that need to be followed.
Then we can have an event,” says John.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by keeping in the air individualized anti-infectives.
The rules and standards are there in addition to the constant review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Department of Public Health and the Department of Public Health and the Department of Public Health are constantly making noises for people, is to consider these individual pathogens.
Both at home and at the same time at the service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents the infection from continuing,” says John.
“We need to encourage people to continue the good journey we have been on in order to be able to keep up with the success we have achieved.”
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes mellitus 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how hard her father had to catch the spirit.
Her father had diabetes, and she encouraged him to seek medical attention.
The next day he was dead.
Andlait was due to acute respiratory problems due to coronavirus infections.
Diabetes was listed on the death certificate as an underlying problem and Brumfield, who is also suffering from diabetes, is afraid of being left unattended.
Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fear is not unfounded.
A recent study by the U.S. government found that as many as 40 percent of those who died from diabetes were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus.
When the proportion of those who have not reached the age of 65 is examined, the proportion increases by half.
The U.S. Anti-Fraud Control (CDC) study surveyed more than 10,000 people in 15 countries who died from the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an expert on infectious diseases at the CDC, says the results are striking, not least for those who have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 2 and their loved ones.
A fall in the slow growth of Reuters led to a survey and pointed out the answers from the 12 countries that responded to comparable rates.
10 states, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, are yet to be diagnosed from underlying diseases.
“Sickness was already at a slow rate of growth.
Now COVID-19 has broken down as a powerful age,” said Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes mellitus is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who have also gotten worse off the coronavirus.
One of the best protections for those with diabetes mellitus 2 is to keep the disease in check with your body, diet, and health care professionals.
The coronavirus pandemic, however, has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine for a week.
Then, the high price of insulin has consumed some to keep coming to work and stop there being exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that the U.S. authorities may have been aware of the dangers that those with diabetes mellitus 2 could have caused by the virus.
When the SARS coronavirus passed in 2003, approximately 20% of them had the disease, and in the 2009 swine flu pandemic, these groups were three times more likely to have to be hospitalized.
When MERS did so, in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to the hospital were diabetic.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that due to the impact of the COVID-19 virus, the epidemic could have further wiped the hole out of a number of previously unknown complications.
“I’m afraid we’ll see a flood of problems when this is over,” said Andrew Bolton, president of the International Diabetes Conference.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus outbreak could lead to an increase in the number of follow-up-related diabetes mellitus, including kidney disease and renal failure.
As a direct new study, the coronavirus could lead to a proliferation of diabetes mellitus.
According to Reuters, scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and diabetes mellitus 2.
The virus affects the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already ill in many people who have diabetes.
Then, a high rate of glucose and lipids in diabetics can cause a so-called "cell messenger storm", as it is called when the immune system responds too hard and attacks the body.
Malignant encephalitis can also lead to an infection that, in turn, can lead to a fatal blood clot.
“It’s all a big puzzle,” says Dela Cruz.
“It all has to do with the opposite.”
The news has been corrected.
“We had a coffee, so we went out of the room.”
The couple, Asr<0xC3><0xBA>n Magn<0xC3><0xBA>sd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir and Atli Bollason, were forced to have sex in front of a camera for works that the artist was setting up in Paris.
“We loved each other so it wasn’t difficult.”
Atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and mother-in-law, Asr<0xC3><0xBA>n Magn<0xC3><0xBA>sd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir.
“I was very jealous of her.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but so did I think it was quite unheard of.
And you still think so,” he said.
As you can see, this is also the first time that your husband has met regularly.
“I’ve always heard this story.
“It’s just the weekend,” she said, adding that her husband also met her for the first time.
“I felt and felt so great a shadow around Atla that I felt.
There’s a lot going on and there’s a lot going on and I’m really excited about it.”
Atli says that the couple have focused on it in their relationship to go their own way.
“We don’t have the same drivers and drivers.
“We’ve been avoiding routines that we’ve seen around us.”
There may be a reason why they took the piece from Ragnar Kjartan’s son-in-law only happily, though that would be, to say the least, unusual.
“Krist<0xC3><0xAD>n Anna, our mutual friend, is in touch with us and asks if we can come and eat dessert with her, Ragga and Ingibj<0xC3><0xB6>rg’s wife Ragnar, at Snaps.”
They took the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and got dessert wine and once and for all the dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who guided them through his design at an art exhibition he planned to set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
“He had a multi-layered video work called Scenes from Western Culture.
He explained it in a simple way.”
Asr<0xC3><0xBA>n says that he described the work as banal and decadent old from the everyday life of Westerners.
“He had a sketch of all the ages he was going to shoot and lastly he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating.”
The last time Ragnar asked the couple to participate was to show young interlocutors to fall in love in a minimalist room.
“It’s the beginning and the end,” Atli says.
The couple didn’t know Ragnar much, though they knew him and he knew them, “but they knew us and we found a way to do it.
They said they didn’t want to advertise to people.
Perhaps they thought that they would not get the right people, but people who got sexual satisfaction from performing for others.”
They accepted Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it did not take long.
“When we were being bullied by Snaps, we said, ‘Aren’t we just for this?’
It was just like that.
I trusted Ragnar as the artist and all his team," says Asr<0xC3><0xBA>n and Atli.
“It’s about love and closeness.”
Senan was taken up in a fine apartment on M<0xC3><0xBD>rargatan.
There was a very poor cinematography; a taker, a Ragnar and a musician and a couple.
After the fire had been on the recording all the rooms to wait outside in a car except Atli and Asr<0xC3><0xBA>n.
“We haven’t decided how we should be.
We had a little bit of guidance, but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
It wasn’t a game, we just loved each other so it wasn’t complicated,” says Asr<0xC3><0xBA>n.
But was it romantic?
“Yes, it was a bit romantic,” says Atli and Asr<0xC3><0xBA>n agrees.
“We were invited to a cocktail party before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on holiday at a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the performance of the pair in the work that moved them.
“When Tommi’s take on this, he was crying, he thought it was so beautiful,” says Atli.
“It’s just as much about love and grace as it is about relationships,” says Asr<0xC3><0xBA>n.
The couple's parents have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard the voice in the son at the Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
“Then she turns around and goes to pee in this,” says Atli.
My mom and dad saw it in Paris.
We didn’t tell anyone this, but then my dad just sent me a message and said, “It’s nice to ride with the little family in the Palais de Tokyo.”
And does the participation in the work intend to deepen the relationship between Asr<0xC3><0xBA>na and Atla?
“We’re still together, so maybe this deepened something.
At least this deepened my relationship with the family,” says Asr<0xC3><0xBA>n and laughs.
He himself saw the work in Kaupmannah<0xC3><0xB6>fn with his colleagues.
“I found it a little difficult not to be with you but with someone else,” she says, turning to her husband.
“But it was nice to see this because it’s just a late in a much bigger work and when you see this with the other works, it’s very nice.
I was a little tired of it and I was just proud of it.
And there was a little bump in my stomach," says Asr<0xC3><0xBA>n, who was innocent of the second child of the spouses when the latter was taken up.
“It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to them about Asr<0xC3><0xBA>n and Atla in Love Stories on R<0xC3><0xA1>s 1.
Swansea with a win in the previous match
Swansea won 1–0 against Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the teams in the finals of the game to get up in the English national team.
The game took place at Swansea's home in Wales.
The place in the semifinals was 0–0.
In the 64th minute, the Swansea natives received a whistle, but Andre Ayew broke the bogalist off the whistle and let him defend himself.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry, a Brentford player, received the red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game with fewer players, and in the 82nd minute, Swansea's players took advantage of the team.
Andre Ayew then improved the squad by scoring a great goal and securing Swansea 1–0 victory.
Swansea lead 1–0 in the singles, but the second game takes place next Wednesday at Brentford home.
Unscheduled for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted to get an armed lifeguard where he feared for his life.
It has not, however, been tireless for the President of the United States to order envoys here in the country.
Since Carol Van Voorst took office as the U.S. ambassador in April 2009, she has been a full-time ambassador to the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst took office under special circumstances, but Kastlj<0xC3><0xB3>s reported from 2009 that she should have received the Falkaord.
In the course of a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the Presidential Office of the subject that she would not be ashamed of the word.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations at Army War College.
Sixteen months left until the successor Van Voorst came to work, in September 2010.
It can be said that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as an envoy, but he did not.
When Loius Ariega finally took up the job, he had then worked in the foreign service for the centenary.
He took up his duties in the autumn of 2013 and took up the post of Ambassador to Guatemala.
Then he took a second non-committal period.
Robert Barber was approved by the U.S. Congress in January 2015 and came to office shortly after, but then no envoys had been on the scene for 13 months.
Barber was a political appointee, not a diplomat, but a lawyer and a supporter of Barack Obama.
He resigned as President Donald Trump took office on January 20, 2017, as is customary with politically appointed envoys.
Trump’s administration was unusual to command both envoys and high-ranking officials in the Washington administration.
So it took two years for the U.S. Congress to announce Jeffrey Ross Gunter at his meeting to question him from the spies and confirm the end of his tenure as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony to the king, he said he had never come to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who died, had been broken by the Dutch mountain.
Gunter is a political appointee, was previously a dermatologist in California and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition (CJC) Jewish Associations.
Playwright Sheldon Adelson founded the association, but Adelson is a strong supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then no envoys had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example in Iceland.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration has been appointing people in key positions and over the past year, the work of the U.S. Senate has been greatly reduced in length, including the confirmation of envoys in office.
Since 2009, there has been a total of over five years of non-commitment in Iceland.
It has not, however, prevented the implementation on behalf of the delegation that opened the new headquarters at Engjateig.
The constructions are estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, but the electrically sealed security walls enclose the building and the glass shutters are in all windows.
It does not seem, however, to have enough to fill the current sentinel’s security knowledge because he is said to be afraid of his life and has wanted to have an armed lifeguard.
<0xC3><0x8D>BV’s first player to become racist in Iceland – “It was a mistake to come to Iceland”
Tony Mawejje, a former <0xC3><0x8D>BV player, said he had become a racist when he was in Iceland and that he was watching after coming to the country.
This is reflected in an interview with Tonny, who appeared on the infamous Daily Monitor.
Tony recently joined the Uganda Police FC team as a player in the top division of Uganda.
In an interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about a lot, including his time here in the country, but he played with <0xC3><0x8D>BV, Val and <0xC3><0x9E>r<0xC3><0xB3>tti in Iceland.
“When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to play.
The team’s lead was in that position but he also had the triple number I wanted so I didn’t get any of what I wanted,” said Tonny, who played at the right corner of the game with <0xC3><0x8D>BV.
One of the things that Tony talks about is racism that he witnessed in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players will face when they play in Europe.
“It came to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just hated what was being said to me.
Later I heard about it, and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
He then told me that my opponent had let a racist remark fall on me after I equipped him."
In 2014, Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
He says he made the mistakes he sees the most.
Tonny had not managed to make it to the starting team at Haugesund but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on a loan, but he joined them at Val.
“It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had been in Norway longer then I would have had the opportunity I wanted to have," said Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway he would probably get further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has made out of his dreams to get to the big one in Europe.
Find a snake in a woman's throat
A doctor at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-cm-long black snake in the neck of a woman who was looking for it.
The doctor was able to pull the snake out with a knife.
A study revealed that the animal was a snitch.
CNN has made this clear.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days earlier, which is thinned meat slices.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but snails on board are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi rumbled into bed in the West, there have been many cases, where snails have lived in people, according to CNN.
I'm afraid there's another wave to start in Europe.
Spain is now in a slump in concern over another wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where governments have taken action to reverse the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
In Catalonia, all the fun life has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where the number of infections is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action due to the spread of infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to go to the asylum at home from Spain, as well as in Norway, and France has been warned of travel to Spain.
In France and Germany, the number of SMEs is also increasing, with governments trying to find a balance between halting the spread of the virus and reinvigorating economic life.
The situation in Europe is good, however, compared to elsewhere in the world, but recent infections worldwide reach 300 thousand per day, with the highest number of infections in America and South Asia.
Globally, there are 16 million confirmed infections, according to Johns Hopkins University, and there are deaths that are confirmed to be linked to the virus, with 644 thousand.
Moses finally gets to enjoy himself to the fullest.
In front of the Toll House in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k is a large and deep hole.
On top of it are men with orange helmets.
There’s also a big cave.
And more smaller workstations.
The street is closed for traffic.
But the corridor is accessible, and many people are now standing by and appreciating the artwork of millions of mosaic tiles —like they’ve never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it doesn’t look like it.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, directly in front of it there were parking lots that were always implemented.
People lay there, locked the car in a hurry, and then jumped to their feet in the middle of the city.
“Living and diverse public spaces” and “responsible urban bridges” are the guiding light for the reconstruction of the now-overlapping Safeway.
The aim is to enhance the area and allow the mosaics of the Helgad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir Gallery at the Customs House to better enjoy the view.
In front of the work there will be a square and since the area is well located by the sun, it is considered well-suited as a residential area for road users.
The artwork will be described and will now allow the material to enjoy its better than before on this 142-metre slab.
In the area there will also be a small "tougher", some kind of water sculptures, which offer a game and provide the area with certain decorations.
In this way, the repairs are described by Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k City, which is being carried out together with Veitum.
The hydroelectricity, thermal and electrical power plants will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their age, but the school policies and cold water laws have been around since 1925 and have served residents and businesses in the city centre for centuries.
When the street is reopened until the end of the road, cars can drive around it again.
However, it will become a one-of-a-kind street and at the same time create more quiet and accessible spaces for pedestrians.
In a paper on the Customs House on the customs manager’s website, he says that the house was put into use in 1971, but its architect was G<0xC3><0xAD>sli Halld<0xC3><0xB3>rsson.
Due to the glamorous access through the house, 250 meters of windowless wall tiles formed out to the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such plots would have a negative impact on the overall streetscape, if no special measures were taken to decorate the appearance of the house.
The members therefore agreed to calculate by setting up a permanent work of art there.
During this time, a lot of words came out of Ger<0xC3><0xB0>i Helgad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, the artist’s wife, says in the summary.
She had worked extensively in the field of mosaics in Germany and beyond.
The decision was to contact her first before deciding whether the topic would be a competition for the work.
It had often been talked about that the work had to reflect life at the port, after all, the port had been the lifeblood of Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k since it was made.
When she spoke to the artist, she had to trax the concept of such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she returned from the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Do<0xC3><0xB0>ur got the time she decided for herself, and when she returned home, she put forward a few suggestions for discussion.
It was immediately agreed to ask her to do the work.
It was also requested to make a comprehensive agreement with her and the famous art company in Germany, the Brothers Oidtmann, but Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur had long worked with them to install famous works of art throughout Europe.
Contracts were concluded and Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur won the artwork under the installation of their brothers’ workshop, which he then saw about the installation at the Customs House.
All the work was individually well solved by hand, both by half Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ar Helgad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir and Oidtmannbr<0xC3><0xB8>ra, says in the summary.
Since then, there has been an unscathed Icelandic weather.
It took Do<0xC3><0xB0>i two years to complete the work, which was completed in 1972 and 1973.
The woman died two years after the completion of the customs work, only 47 years old.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Transporting more institutions abroad
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Da<0xC3><0xB0>ason, Minister of Social Affairs, is proposing that more public institutions be moved to the country in the near future.
This was said by the minister in the episode Splendid on The Watchtower this afternoon.
Recently, it was announced that the fire department of the Housing and Human Resources Agency will be moved north to Sau<0xC3><0xB0><0xC3><0xA1>rkr<0xC3><0xB3>k in the autumn.
Six experts in the field of firefighting work at the organisation, but none of them intend to accompany the organisation to the north and the Landssamband of recreational and sick transport has criticized the housing transports.
“I think we need to take a step further in this process.
I am preparing for a further step in this process.
More transportation," said <0xC3><0x81>smundur.
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see more distribution of public institutions around the country.
“I think it is necessary to make further policy decisions on the transport of public works abroad, as I was doing with the Housing and Human Resources Agency,” <0xC3><0x81>smundur said, but he also took the example of other institutions that have been transferred to the country, the exchange of funds and the exchange of funds.
All the most important things from the second day of mastery
94. Iceland’s free-sport championship ended at <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>rsvell in Akureyri today.
Some of the matches were played on the second day of the competition.
It was calculated with an exciting competition in the most striking women in <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>rsvell, but Vigd<0xC3><0xAD>s J<0xC3><0xB3>nsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir from FH put <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmet in the most striking in 2014, which lasted until Elisabet Rut R<0xC3><0xBA>narsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir from IR improved the rating in May last year.
Vigd<0xC3><0xAD>s won the Icelandic Cup back earlier this summer and has been in fantasy form up in the finals, but she has tripled the Icelandic Cup as of summer.
Elizabet Ruth has been struggling with injuries and did not get on strike today.
She had only one valid throw of five, threw 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigd<0xC3><0xAD>s threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt and set the course of resistance.
She set her Icelandic height earlier in July at 62.69 meters and was, however, quite a bit from it.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n Kar<0xC3><0xAD>tas Hallgr<0xC3><0xAD>msd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir from IR had the next best throw of the day, but she improved her best performance by throwing up to 50.18 meters.
In the men's group, the FH team winner Hilmar <0xC3><0x96>rn J<0xC3><0xB3>nsson, the Icelandic national champion, won a safe victory, but he threw 73.84 meters in his next final throw and put the opponent.
The area of the island is 75.26 meters.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>ni Valur Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason, Olympic champion and Icelandic athlete in the box office, won a competition in a ballpark in <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>rsvell yesterday but today he competed in the box office, which is his main course.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>na Vals is 65.53 meters, but he threw the longest 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second time today, but he had one valid throw that fell in the second seat, 49.43 meters.
Hafd<0xC3><0xAD>s Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>ard<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, Iceland’s long-distance runner, won the long-distance race with a surface, but Hafd<0xC3><0xAD>s jumped the longest 6.25 metres today, which is a drop of 40 cm from her Icelander.
In the women’s 200 metre race it was the IR team Gu<0xC3><0xB0>bj<0xC3><0xB6>rg J<0xC3><0xB3>na Bjarnad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir who had sprinted but she came to the finish in 24.04 seconds while her Icelandic team in the section is 23.45 seconds.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>bj<0xC3><0xB6>rg J<0xC3><0xB3>na was a winner in Akureyri, but she won two gold medals yesterday, in a 100 m race and in a 4 x 100 m race and then also in a 4 x 400 m race today.
In the men's group, Kolbeinn H<0xC3><0xB6><0xC3><0xB0>ur Gunnarsson from FH scored first in the 200 metre race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of <0xC3><0x93>liver M<0xC3><0xA1>na Sam<0xC3><0xBA>elsson from <0xC3><0x81>rmanni.
Like Gu<0xC3><0xB0>bj<0xC3><0xB6>rg J<0xC3><0xB3>na, Kolbeinn H<0xC3><0xB6><0xC3><0xB0>ur won gold in the 100 metres yesterday as well as in the 400 metres race.
Don't get fined for 27 million kroner Bitcoin crop
The Oversight Committee has rejected the request of a tax research director who was charged with perjury for misappropriation of his financial assets that were due to the sale of the Bitcoin e-wallet.
The Committee finds that the conclusion that the Director of Tax Investigation had not provided a clear justification for why it was necessary to punish the person.
In the Committee’s decision, it is noted that the Director of Tax Research considered that the man was aware of materially incorrect tax returns due to the 2016 and 2017 income years.
He would have miscalculated his financial assets that were due to the sale of the Bitcoin e-wallet of up to 27 million, either arbitrarily or out of immense inadequacy.
Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him.
The man denied it in a letter to the committee.
However, in 2016, he sold an electric model for 27 million.
Hana would have acquired him by a spell in 2009 and 2010 when both of these would have been easy and inexpensive with a normal household income.
He then pointed out that when he sold the electric bill, the tax implementation of such a sale would have been very unclear and unpredictable.
It could have been expected that the public would be aware of such measures in the case of a tax proceeding.
He would not have been willing to pay tax on the listing and would have identified his property on an appeal as a deposit on a currency account.
He would have asked both the experts and the tax authorities how this would have been done, but without success.
Then he thought he needed to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to introduce complex rules on which the tax authorities had not formed a clear view.
The man therefore rightly considered that his taxes on these two incomes would be recalculated and the burden applied, but otherwise no punishment was made.
He said he had been in Iceland and had paid taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He had never intended to do his duty in an irreconcilable way.
The demand for a sect would be of all sorts and would plunge him into debt.
He said: “This guy knows what football is.
Brynj<0xC3><0xB6>lfur Andersen Willumsson has been numerous between the teeth of people but also aroused admiration for his performance of what is of play with Brei<0xC3><0xB0>ablik in the Pepsi Max division.
Blinks will be on the line tonight when they receive the <0xC3><0x8D>A in a live broadcast on Stadium 2 Sport.
Brynj<0xC3><0xB6>lfur then takes out the playoffs due to four reminders of the season and therefore does not come into play with a new cut as in the summer games so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his neck for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
“I don’t know who exactly he was responding to with the payment, but talking about the character then this was better to try in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants to get the ball every time and if there was anyone going to equalize this game then I thought he would do it or make it," Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Benediktsson told Pepsi Max.
“I’m here for the people.”
“Sometimes it’s hard to know what position he is in.
He looks a little out on the left when it comes to feeling the game, but he has a very free roll in the team," Hj<0xC3><0xB6>rvar Hafli<0xC3><0xB0>ason said.
<0xC3><0x9E>orkell M<0xC3><0xA1>ni Pétursson says Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lf is a real entertainer and thus enjoys getting such a colorful man in the department: “No one shares that this is a character.
This is a fun guy and I love it with my hair, and to be always ready to meet and answer in interviews.
“There are a lot of people who are obsessed with him, who tell me that this man understands what football is.
“I am a fun force.
I have to be here for the people and enjoy it.”
People are reading the interviews with Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lf, people are paying themselves in and watching what is next on his hair.
“This man is just a genius,” said Manny.
KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I have been in contact with some teams in the B-department"
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max division, appears to be on the run from the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to go back to Denmark.
F<0xC3><0xB3>tbolti.net also reported on the matter.
Tobias wants to reach the start of the season in his home country, but to do so, he first has to cancel his contract with KR, where the Danish division starts before the Icelandic league.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a great deal of understanding," Tobias told Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with some teams in the B-team and will probably switch before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay my contract with KR.”
Then he says that he needs to take on all the odds of a pay cut in Denmark.
“Societies in Denmark have probably found more for the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
Bike expert Bjartmar has recovered bikes for millions - Responds now after DV coverage
For over a year, Bjartmar Le<0xC3><0xB3>sson has had an interest unlike most others.
He wakes up and saves the dirt and the table bicycles, electric bikes and backpacks.
Bjartmar has earned the name “the biker” for the week.
Yesterday there was such a huge fireworks display when one published a narrative of their conversations with Bjartmar.
DV then referred to a discussion on Facebook of a group of Westerners who stated that Bjartmar had taken the man to a speech in Austurvell and said the vestpuna could be a chair.
It was not possible to read from the original writings of the electrician but that Bjartmar had stolen it.
Those texts have now been modified on Facebook and the forecast of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the initial news of the case is not at all descriptive of what actually happened yesterday in Austervelli.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the victim's e-mail account that this was indeed his e-mail.
That information was given to the owner from others, but the information turned out to be incorrect, says Bjartmar.
“I looked at the gas station and I looked at the shots, ending with information that there was an electric scooter that had been missing for a very long time and had been looking for.
I certainly walked first, but when I saw him living under to start the shoot, I decided to choose to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his case and I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I go very well in such a case, but before I got to finish what I had to say, the man had taken it from me."
Bjartmar says that the man on the e-mail had just as invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and had himself called the police.
"Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this straight."
So the owner of the e-cigarette proved ownership of his e-cigarette and left.
Later, the owner of the e-mail said the right of its history on Facebook, as well as an article from the previous news.
In this bed of the year that Bjartmar has spent time on this profession, he says he can count the difference that he landed on the edge of people on the fingers of another hand.
“I have been in peaceful contact with the most difficult men in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k,” Bjartmar said, pointing out that cyclists are the least likely to be the brothers and sisters of the community, drug addicts, gangsters and other people who are responsible for some of the data.
“The technology is hard on the house owner and somehow the next dose needs to be financed, unfortunately, stealing such funds is an easy way to achieve that goal,” says Bjartmar.
“My interactions with these people are really so good that I’ve got a lot of good people with me on the team.
Examples are that people have gone to treatment and taken on and looked for me and helped me with what I’m doing,” he says.
In general, Bjartmars communicates with cyclists on courtesian notes.
Some know of him and what he is doing and offer him peaceably to show him receipts, number of wheels and so on.
Cycling is a major problem that has not been discussed much at all.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police are more likely to tell people to talk to him from behind the wheel.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with the previous press release DV and says there are no independent police officers in a more personal search for justice.
Asked if he has not yet reached the top of the ice with his skills, and if this is not first and foremost the role of the police, Bjartmar says so certainly be.
“Of course the police have to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are absolutely not to blame for this.
I've been looking up at cops driving away from a big pile of table bikes.
It’s completely unsatisfying in these matters.”
“When the police are not doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this category, then why not?” asks Bjartmar.
He says he has achieved so much success in riding his bikes on the table, that sometimes he runs on his “guardians” on the street that they only have the right Bjartmari bikes that they had previously achieved.
The time that Bjartmar has called for police help has come to the conclusion that she is not in the clear.
“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not teaching to me and it’s not the owners of the bikes to teach,” Bjartmar said, and regrets that victims of motorcycle gangs have to feel the emptiness of the police in this category.
The success of Bjartmar is not shared.
People everywhere can find stories of thanks to Bjartmari for reaching out to their owners again.
Bjartmar himself says he has long since lost the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts run naturally in millions, if not millions.
This is where electric bicycles, electric bicycles and electric scooters weigh, but electric bicycles can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works for a day at a gym and every other weekend he works at a gym.
His bike ride is therefore unpaid work that he spends in his spare time.
Life savings and a lot of shadows
2019 was a big year in the history of life insurance in Iceland.
Officials had been paid back by the King of Denmark on all roads since the 19th century, but in 1919 a life savings fund was established for the officials who eventually became the life savings fund for all public employees.
The basic principle that the current pension funds of general wage earners were then laid down by the general government contracts on the labour market in 1969, where provision was made for a labour-related pension fund with an obligation and a full-fledged fund collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were enacted on the basis of these treaties, and the life-saving system continued to thrive after that.
The wage system was not the only radical change that the labor movement of the 20th century brought about by its carnage.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar way in the historical workshops in 1955, and the associations also received a small sum of their claims on sickness and sickness benefit, substantial entitlement to leave, reduction of working hours and improvements in housing.
All these rights cost a great and severe struggle, but it turned out, after looking, much more and more durable than the number of auras in the wage bracket, which disappeared as hard into the atmosphere of inflation that characterized the post-war period until 1990 as many remember.
The contribution to the creation of a public health fund in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although people eventually come to the conclusion that the funds would become the real property of the financial companies, the business movement had to fall under the obligation of their management to appoint the representatives of the accountants and the financial companies equally.
In the next few years after the foundation of the funds, the demand for the majority of the employees in the management of the funds often came up for discussion in the associations of the employees, but it never managed to move forward, and therefore we still sit up with the abnormal arrangement that the representatives of the financial companies are not in financial institutions.
Article 36 of Act No 129/1997 on the insurance of life rights and the activities of life insurance funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
In the first paragraph, it states that ‘the life savings fund shall have the interests of the financial partners in the light of the guidelines’.
It also states in Figure 5: “The Life Equity Fund shall set a moral benchmark in investments.”
The shareholders’ policy of the Life Equity Fund shall include, inter alia, the following provisions, in accordance with the aforementioned legal provisions:
The LIFE Fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investments, as well as many of the largest LIFE Fund and professional investment funds in the Western Sea and in Europe.
The rules discuss how focusing on environmental and social issues, as well as good governance of companies, can contribute to improving the investment performance of the securities markets.
In this way, the interests of investors and the objectives of the national society are combined in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, in particular those registered on the stock market, adopt a public policy: to maintain a good level of governance in terms of social responsibility and environmental issues.
Valdi, the capital fund with the largest funds in the country, has set up a “responsible investment policy” and there are provisions of similar trains.
This is all outlined here as the entrance to Iceland’s newest fashion word, “shadow management”.
Since the word is used in the matter, it is not hoped that it has been defined to a lesser degree, but the following definition now appears to me to be “most taken”: The shadow government is it when the president of a confederacy says in the media that he intends to send a representative to a private society
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the first convenience.
If the president doesn’t do this in the media and doesn’t speak out, then it’s not the end of “administration” so there is always communication between people in the financial world as elsewhere.
I let the reader think about how he feels “beautiful.”
In particular, there are two men who have tried to formulate this definition when it is written, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are H<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>ur <0xC3><0x84>gisson, a journalist in the newspaper, and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir J<0xC3><0xB3>nsson, the head of the central bank.
The initiative by both parties was not made possible by Bogi Nils Bogason, the chairman of Icelandair, who had said that the chairman of Icelandair had agreed to the terms of the contract with the airline and the airline (repeat them), and Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r Ing<0xC3><0xB3>lfsson, the chairman of the Swedish Association for Economic Affairs.
Some time later Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and later Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r went the same way with his recommendations, which of course focused on Boga's decision.
Nevertheless, they saw H<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>ur and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir reason to multiply the issue in the Friday Journal of the Journal with great words about shadow governance, law violations and the rich need for changes in laws.
There, a small pond would certainly have to turn a heavy stream even though the blessing pond had been in contact and also was dried out quickly.
Since it’s important, let’s think about the content itself in the end.
I’ve listed below the items in the Life Insurance Act that deal with this issue.
They point out that the financial institutions must take care of the interests of the financial companies and have moral criteria in their investments, and these items are carried out in more detail in the approvals of both the Valid and the Life Insurance Fund of the traders as I mentioned.
On the other hand, capital funds should NOT only look at the short-term profit margins in their investments.
This would be a very high-risk policy, and there is no need to look for long-term examples of this in the past, where large sums of money from banks and funds have run into immoral adventures and environmental issues, with terrible consequences.
Icelandair was obviously on the ice when he decided to wipe out the entire group of workers, thus significantly reducing the prosperity the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis investors.
He looked at himself and pulled it back.
The time has shown whether it is sufficient to ensure that the investment of life-saving funds in the company can be considered as a liability to the fund companies at the time of its establishment.

One of the infected people did not have a home infection.
One of the three people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic States on 15 July last year, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelandic who does not live here to the standard and therefore did not receive clear instructions to accompany the so-called homecoming after arriving in the country and going to another screening a few days after the arrival.
He got negative from the skirmish at the border.
“But he’s in Icelandic society, and he’s actually going to go to that resource,” says Kamilla J<0xC3><0xB3>sepsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, a specialist in the field of surveillance at Landk<0xC3><0xB6>kni and the presence of a surveillance doctor during his summer vacation, in a conversation with the newspaper today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the identification number and if the identification number is not registered then you are not automatically notified in the second sample.”
She says the man has been able to use the English registration form because he is actually resident abroad but because of his connection to the country as an Icelandic he would rather have used it in Icelandic.
But he didn’t realize that.
“When the class is not registered, you need to apply for it yourself to come to the second screening.
Neither he nor his employer seems to have realized that it was the right way," says Kamilla.
“So it’s clear that we need to expand the information on this while we find some way to make an automated bidding system, even though Icelanders don’t register their credentials.
Or to make it somehow clearer who are participants in the Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
The best way to deal with this is to get to the country, although he is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, the remaining Icelander.
Only six have been sent to the hospital after he was diagnosed yesterday and these six were all in contact with him.
They still have to go to the screening, but two of them are starting to show signs of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative from his demonstration at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says he may have been recently infected by the virus, but she has not yet been able to detect it when the sight was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to exclude that the man has been infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus with him to the country.
“It’s not quite possible to maintain that this is definitely an imported infection because it’s been a long time since he came to the country that he might have been exposed here like these two who have caused some disruption in connection with the sport.”
She says it’s very unlikely because of how few people have dealt with it.
“It’s actually very unlikely,” Kamilla says, but points out that it can’t be ruled out until the Icelandic genetic analysis has already sorted the virus into the human.
“If we get a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain that it’s brought it to the country.”
Piperpreyi and explosives used against countermeasures
There was an attack between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
The police used a piperprey and an unmanned hand blast, but the counters broke the window and ignited.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were killed.
Police violence and sexual harassment were widely opposed in the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were in support of the protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one opposing shot was fired.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands of people gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to the building site and broke the windows of the city’s courthouse.
Later, the police said the protests were unfair and there was an attack between groups of protesters and the police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Justice Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was murdered by police in August last year, was the least of the opponents.
The car ran through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of members of the National Guard came together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was murdered by police at her home in March last year.
The group carried a gun and went to the villages to closed street rallies where police blamed the group from a group of people who opposed the protests and also carried a gun.
There were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters recalled James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white barmaid in May.
Sunflower: Not the game that defines our period
Ole Gunnar Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r, the manager of Manchester United, does not want to overdo the importance of the game with Leicester today in the final round of the English national team.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea do not lose against Wolves, Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r and his men end up in 5th place and lose to the Champions League.
They should, however, still hope to get into the Champions League by winning the European Championship next month.
“We haven’t reached the finish line.
“If we get to a point against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven’t had a bad season,” Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
“But whatever happens, it’s not the end of our journey because we still have a lot of ground to get the teams two ahead of us,” Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
It is clear that people’s nerves will still be around 3 p.m. today, but Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r tried to make it look like every other game was about to be played.
“If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is the foundation of the company.
We have had a great opportunity to finish the season well and now it is ours to use it," Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
"It's not the most important game of the season, it's just the next game.
You can ask who is in football, the next game is always the most important.
The outcome does not define our period, we have already had many moments to define this period."
“The arrival of Bruno Fernandes has changed a lot for us and I think we are in a better shape and will be stronger spiritually than in the last period,” Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
65,000 people infected with sunflowers
65,490 new coronavirus infections were detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the west since the beginning of the epidemic in the country.
900 people died from the virus yesterday but in the last four days, more than 1,000 people died from the virus every day.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to the report, according to the U.S. Department of Defense, the death toll from the virus will be 175,000 on August 15.
Fear of another wave of disaster
Spain’s government is now trying to recover from the increased spread of COVID-19 in the country.
The Spanish health authorities identified over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursdays and Fridays.
There have not been any more detected in a single day since the beginning of May and the outbreaks are coming at the same time as the Spaniards are beginning to catch one of the most severe outings in Europe.
The backlash has led to the British authorities now requiring passengers arriving from Spain to return to their country of origin.
A week ago, Spain was on the UK's list of safe states.
The situation is the worst in Catalonia in the north-eastern part of Spain, where governments have stepped up broader limits to try to vote at the rate of growth.
In the capital city of Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and old houses will be closed in the middle of the night.
Then the passage is now in force for the 200,000 inhabitants of the Segria region in the western part of Catalonia.
It is believed that the decision of the United Kingdom will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which is very angry at the arrival of foreign tourists and is a bad game after the tragedy.
Tui, the UK’s largest travel agency, cancelled all scheduled flights to Spain and the Canary Islands today.
Governments around the world have been told to prepare under the second wave of the epidemic, but little interest seems to be in re-arranging to the periphery of the corridor, which has largely laid waste.
To form Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken such and similar measures as nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Jean Castex, the French prime minister, said the nation “wouldn’t get away with life, economically or socially,” if it were to be taken back to the country’s streets.
Many councillors hope that local resources that reach the inhabitants of individual towns, cities or regions will be sufficient to keep the virus in the next round if it comes to it.
Five new infections in Iceland – three inland
Three domestic incidents were identified yesterday as well as two more at the border.
This is how five people with a positive Covid-19 infection were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
In a press release, the general public says that one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent to solitary confinement and sixteen who were in close contact with him in a coma.
The infected person was a participant in the social work of the sports society in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k and is, according to the report, “the only part of the sport” in the vaccine.
Others who were sent in the envelope relate to the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is undetected and the full course of the infection in the immunization range of the state police officer.
Opponents of the ReyCUP response have followed the instructions and rules of the attending physician and the general practitioner that are still in force and have taken appropriate measures.
However, photos of the mode were kept in mind yesterday as they could see in a very close atmosphere to celebrate the good turn of their team out on the pitch.
Just before 11 a.m. today, the following notification was posted on their Facebook page.
“ATH: Parents, please respect the rules that competitors apply for their own daughter in school.
Parents are not allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding.”
Another infection was reported yesterday, but it is related to the infection that was reported from yesterday.
According to the report, “Icelandic genetic analysis has identified the infection and revealed a new type of virus that has not been identified before.”
Contagion is also performed and is the one infected in isolation and 12 in the vaccine due to the infection.
The third reported infection was from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
It is located on the south-west corner of the country.
He is now in solitary confinement and six who were in close contact with him in a coma.
Two of them are already starting to show signs of a viral infection.
In addition, two were identified at the border and the results of further research are expected, such as a procedure in the introduction of border provisions.
In conclusion, the report says: The Department of Public Safety’s director of police and the office of a public health officer encourage people to be careful and take good care of their individual immune systems.
The game has the slightest doubt as to whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present is the same one being asked to go to the screening at the next health center.
Patreksfj<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>ur says campsite booked for shopping weekend - Beinir guests other
The camp site at Patreksfj<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>ur is fully booked over the weekend, according to Vesturbygg<0xC3><0xB0>ar’s announcement.
Guests are advised to check out other accommodation options.
Names Vesturbygd B<0xC3><0xAD>ldudal, T<0xC3><0xA1>lknafj<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>, Melanes a Raudasand, Hotel Fl<0xC3><0xB3>kalund and Hotel Brei<0xC3><0xB0>av<0xC3><0xAD>k as other options in the resort.
It is enough to be at Patreksfj<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>ur this weekend, because, as last year, Skj<0xC3><0xA4>ldborg, the festival of Icelandic portraits will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and therefore has become the strongest tradition in the city.
For reasons in the camp area to judge you can expect a good meeting this year, if the weather does not put a strike in the account, but DV said earlier today from the derivative forecast.
However, we can expect the worst weather so far, and hope for Patreksfj<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>ur.
The website bb.is first said, and said that all other properties in the city were already booked.
Whole apartment cave down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live freely in Dunhaga 18–20.
While the owners are applying for a building permit for renovations, their land has grown into the system for the third year.
In one of Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k's oldest, greenest and most expensive neighbourhoods stands a mobile multi-family house on three floors.
On the ground floor of the house is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
At the back of the house there are two staircases, each of which contains four rather well-maintained apartments.
They are between 93–130 meters, but most of them are over 100 meters.
The house has a history of storage.
It was founded in 1959 and has housed video rental, Sk<0xC3><0xB3>stofuna, dairy dairy, J<0xC3><0xB3>a gun sale, fish sale and now last university rent.
The house has, as little as it is to say, remembered its silly beauty.
The house is now under great damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are according to the company register, among others Magn<0xC3><0xBA>s Magn<0xC3><0xBA>sson and Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n Helga L<0xC3><0xA1>rusd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir.
Magn<0xC3><0xBA>s went to the Borgunar owner group and was a defender of the Borgunar holding company.
In the group owned by the holding company Borgunar is St<0xC3><0xA1>lskip ehf.
St<0xC3><0xA1>lskip ehf. is the investment company of Godr<0xC3><0xBA>n Helgu L<0xC3><0xA1>rusd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir and her children.
Gudr<0xC3><0xBA>n is also the owner of the third division of D18 ehf.
Gudrun and her husband, August Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>sson, once ran the version of St<0xC3><0xA1>lskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore little that has been held since then.
Tell your neighbors that the condition of the house has steadily deteriorated since then, even more so in recent years.
On Facebook, a resident of the neighborhood said the house had “not been particularly lively in recent years.”
It can be played in that the owners have about a few years of fun after changing the house and the plot.
Other neighbors say the house has not been well for a long time.
“It’s a long time to do something common with this sheet and it’s sad that it’s gone down like this.”
He also says that he is angry at the owners of the house for not having managed to finish this, found some common plot with the neighboring house and stopped this “legislative step”.
“Just do it in consultation with the community around so you can rush into this and finish it.”
The “Legisl<0xC3><0xA4>g<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xB0>tsippi<0xC3><0xB0>” referred to by the apartment is the planning process of the reitsin, which has been in operation since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were then forced to build a height above the current multi-family house and behind the house, a new elevator and a single-storey building as well as cellars.
The building permit granted for that implementation was submitted to the Committee of the Regions on environmental and resource issues and the Committee considered it to be out of value, since the implementation did not have the support of the parties and the detailed notification was not sufficient.
Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k City then started the partnership work and ended it with an advertisement in the Board of Directors last July.
That arrangement was also beloved and the committee dropped it out of force in March 2020.
At this point, it was almost three years since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the house were on the initial route.
During this time, the house had been severely damaged and the neighbors were getting tired.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house out into the situation and the reactions of the neighbors were answered in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the intentions of the owners of the house, others did not.
Others went to the city, others didn’t.
Others were just angry, but nothing was necessarily out in the open.
Still others said the parking lot was deserted, but the neighbors have used the unused Dunhaga 18–20 parking lot under their vehicles.
A friend of mine said a long time ago on the board of directors:
“The fact that we have to go through the process in three years is absolutely incredible.
It’s like a city that can’t read.”
Today the house stands empty, abandoned and is empty.
A reminder of the city’s long-term governance and the generous intentions of the owners and many years of their work that are now on the starting line.
When the reporter was walking to Dunhaga 18 park, he was knocked out by a galloping door and a trash can.
Playstation computers and new TVs lay inside another garbage on the ground — victims of the Icelandic summer blaze.
It was opened in the old office of the University Hospital, where a large number of cats from the smell of strawberry to judge.
It’s clear that someone has looked around in one corner, but no one is visible.
Figures of sofas and beds, and a few sheets of geographies, which you probably should have to book, bubbled up.
The stairs of the apartment house were also open and life in both of them.
A journalist was so lucky to be able to run on their fellow citizens.
The Romanians were there to buy potatoes for dinner and invited the journalist in.
The Romanians work for the employee team Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time, and the army has allowed DV to pay nothing for the house except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it does not seem defensive to collect rent.
From the stands of mail at the door of the house to judge it is clear that there has been a number of foreign workers at the last mass.
The executive staff hire has not been part of the Covid-19 situation, the end of the contraction in tourism led to the contraction in the construction industry and these two industries have been how efficient it is to use the services of the staff hire.
However, it seems that the residents of Dunhaga 18 have a lot to do and the workers and the drivers in the compound are stuck to dry after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the terrible condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist asked the boys in Romanian, the coldness suddenly became clear to him: The best place in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k stands 1,500 square meters of real estate underground.
Owners want to change the house to be repaired and neighbors want to improve the condition but share the definition of "repair".
In the meantime, the city’s organisational environment is at the forefront, the victim of endless provocations and romanticism in the organisation process and the phase of the resolution of the Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources.
In the house there are such Romanian workers, perhaps precisely those who go to improve the situation, when the Icelandic people cease to tear up.
The article originally appeared in the weekend newspaper DV on July 17.
Anti-hypertensive treatment following a coronavirus
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will donate <0xC2><0xA3>10 million to the campaign against overweight, which will, among other things, be banned from emergency BIT announcements, following his serious weakening, in part because of his weight.
Johnson reportedly announces the campaign, which has been dubbed Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to assign bikes to their bodybuilders in excess weight and will also be charged with the proliferation of bike rides.
The announcements of emergency restaurants on television will be banned before 9 p.m., according to British media sources.
“COVID-19 has woken us up against the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthy foods,” the statement said.
Johnson himself has been dealing with weight problems to fight, but he was put into surgery when he was infected with the coronavirus last spring, and it is that part of his weight due to which he is thought to have been so severely weakened.
Women are more likely to make changes.
She said that the new constitution would be the biggest step that the nation can take towards more power-sharing, transparency and in working against corruption and the interests of the whole.
“We need to change gear a little now and who is better at making such changes than the group of society that should be easier to be in these values.
“There are women,” Helga said.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s association.
To stand together and be together in the direction of change.
So now we just have to make these changes.”
She said she was a little concerned about Iceland’s focus as the “best in the world” in both gender equality and human rights.
“We’re not quite ready to see what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
It's a hill.
We need to know where we are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to a series of random groups.
We don’t all have the same rules here,” Helga said.
The question she said women are in many ways in good cause in Iceland, but added that, as elsewhere, Icelanders are building with a rosy male value.
She said that the policy was about forming a self-interest, a sovereignty, and a power that would be the forces that maintained injustice in all societies.
“Women are now ready to set up this group and come together and are just getting a little annoyed that Althingi is going to move beyond this 2012 referendum,” she said.
“It’s these female values that we’re thinking about.
Out of human rights and protection of nature, cooperation and that we all really sit at the same table," she said, adding that the above-mentioned values were the basic values of the new constitution.
“We are a very rich country of natural resources and it is absurd that there are people living in poverty.
It’s ridiculous, we can divide differently,” Helga said.
“It’s ridiculous that it’s a natural law that women’s jobs are always lower paid.
It’s ridiculous that air fresheners and nurses need endlessly to stand in a quagmire just to get human wages.”

Attempted to rob pedestrians in the city centre
A man was arrested in the city centre last night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in <0xC3><0x81>rb<0xC3><0xA6>, where two were arrested for the matter.
The police then stopped the motorbike driver in Hl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC3><0xB0>inen, where his driver was at a speed of 146 km, with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
The police in the capital had enough to turn around last night and there were about 80 cases recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of noise because of the noise.
On the eve of Saturday, reports of 11 loud noises were reported, and it was widely considered in the diary of the police.
At night, however, 22 loud noises were reported to the police.
Six people were taken to prison last night.
In Arb<0xC3><0xAA>n, police were called to the night when people were shooting airplanes in the air.
However, they were prevented when police officers arrived at the park.
At that time, nine drivers were stopped for alcoholism and or drug abuse.
Four of them were arrested for beatings in the city centre last night, but one of them was saved in a prison cell.
Then two were transported to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the center and the other in the West Bank.
One was transported to the accident department after he crashed on a trampoline in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavog.
In addition, police officers stopped the driver who drove a motorhome in Kjalarnesi yesterday.
According to the police’s logbook, the wheelhouse’s equipment was in “very bad condition” and it was abandoned.
You can stay in Monet for the weekend
The house that Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his training in is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next free nights in the house are about the shopkeeper weekend.
The house is small and beautiful, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two sitting rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet first got inspired to paint his gardens famous in this house.
If you want to rent a house, you must rent it for at least two nights.
According to Airbnb’s website, it’s next week’s free, on Sunday’s shopping weekend, and therefore might be ideal for some shoppers on vacation to rush into booking the painter’s house.
The two nights over the weekend will cost only 964 U.S. dollars or just over 130,000 Icelandic kroner, whichever comes next.
Teeth in the vaccine and some of them begin to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with coronavirus within the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Dozens have been infected because of this and some of them begin to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically yesterday and two were diagnosed at the border crossing.
An expert in the field of public health says that a growing number of domestic experts do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely in the community.
“There’s been a disconnect from the previous domestic environment and there’s a virus that hasn’t been seen here before so we don’t have any particular reason to believe that it’s gone into society for a while.
This is probably something that is new to the country, but of course we need to be very well on guard now," said Kamilla Sigr<0xC3><0xAD><0xC3><0xB0>ur J<0xC3><0xB3>sefsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, a specialist in the field of surveillance of the official doctor.
Most of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling will be carried out in the near future, but some, which were in contact with those infected, have begun to show the symptoms of the coronavirus.
“Now there is no influenza in progress and less about other respiratory infections so we can be quite free to do this test on individuals who at the time of the influenza would have found a reason to do something else first,” Kamilla said.
It is mostly closed but it is not ruled out that more people need to go to the clinic.
Two of the injured were diagnosed after applying for a sports event.
It has raised questions about whether it is advisable to hold such an event.
The communicator says it well as long as people follow the rules and standards.
Kamilla says it is almost impossible for the infected to have been infected in sports.
“If there is no more isolation from these individuals after having dealt with them in these sports, then we can maintain that our defenses in the sports have worked.
But it hasn’t been revealed,” Kamilla said.
The Office of the Directorate-General for Civil Protection is under constant review.
“We need to be prepared to intervene with further recommendations or restrictions if there seems to be an opportunity,” Kamilla said.
After more than a week, the number limits are set to be extended to thousands of people.
This new position could have an impact on the recommendations.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>A certain mindset to cook” - See Elisu Vi<0xC3><0xB0>ar’s menu
Elisa Vi<0xC3><0xB0>arsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir is an Afrikaans woman in the game and plays with Val.
She is also a master of nutrition, a mother, and serves as a nutritionist.
It needs a lot of energy for the most part of the day and usually gives itself time to cook good and nutritious food.
My normal day starts when I get to work from eight,” says Elisa.
“After work, I go to the store to be able to prepare dinner before I pick up my daughter at the gym at three o’clock.”
Elisu finds it very tempting to get her daughter early in the play school.
“It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice the second part.
After exercise, it is good to come home and just need to warm up the food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we feel good to look at one part to clear the mind.”
Elisa does not follow any specific diet.
She is putting an end to her master’s degree in nutrition, so she knows what it’s like to eat to have enough energy to do her job, school, family, and exercise.
“What suits me is eating a variety of foods that are well-composed of proteins, carbohydrates and fats.
However, I think it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to classify food into bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
It’s okay to eat everything, just not everything at once and not always.”
Elisa has a great interest in cooking.
“I think it’s a good idea to sit in the kitchen and cook a lot.
I have to say that self-confidence is with me in the kitchen and I firmly believe that I am a good cook.”
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little citric acid, put in almond milk overnight.
Top this meal with whatever it is.
Most often it is bananas and poppy mussels & coffee.
I'm a big coffee lady.
Intermediate: Incredibly uneven, but fruits or vegetables, flatbreads, clean dishes with bananas and mussels, bread with a charge and so I could eat hummus with the spoon out of the box if that is the case.
Lunch: I often live in all kinds of nutritious salads from what is available in the ice cream shop, quinoa or building, falafel balls, rock salad, baked vegetables with good training is a bit what I’m working with.
If the arrangement completely goes out of the way (which happens often) then the egg machine at work has come to my rescue a lot often and then there are 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and sweetened egg, do not put more on you.
Millim<0xC3><0xA1>l: Get me something carbon-rich for exercise, bread with a charge, breakfast cereal or fruit.
Dinner: Fish will be very often for the choice of my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
A Clash Between Police and Opponents in Seattle
The city authorities in Seattle, Washington, have described the insurgency in the wake of mass protests in the city centre.
Yesterday, police seized explosives and pipelines to try to clean up a large area that the protesters had laid down and stretched over many lengths of houses in the vicinity of the city’s parliament building.
The police said on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that the investigation was based on a piece of damage done at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of explosion.
The city and police authorities say the protesters have cleared the police with mortars, bottles, grenades and other explosives and one policeman was transported to a hospital where his injuries were done.
However, the protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The blast was there to show opponents in Portland, Oregon consistency, but there has been a squabble in the city between opponents and heavily armed local state police.
There, like in several cities in the United States, people gather under the brand name Black Lives Matter, remembers Georges Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, who opposes systemic racism in American society and demands redress.
Not revoked until after the vote has been taken.
It remains to be seen whether their statements by Icelandair, which is due to take effect in the coming months, will be revoked.
The electronic voting on Iceland Airlines’ charter agreement for airfreight at Icelandair ends at noon this morning.
Mr Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug L<0xC3><0xAD>ney J<0xC3><0xB3>hannsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, chairman of the company, said that Icelandair will not take a decision on the cancellations until the result of the voting is available.
“It’s definitely going to work,” says Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug L<0xC3><0xAD>ney.
“There have not been any cancellations, this has to go to bed so that the machines can be humanized.
So, of course, people are inexhaustible after getting to know if it will be with work after the monthly meeting.”
The contract was signed a week ago, on the night of July 19.
It is assumed to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement previously entered into by airfreight.
On 17 July, the Board of Directors and the Board of Trustees of the Icelandic Air Force approved the offer of a full-service station at Icelandair, and the members accepted it in a vote.
It never came to be, but this was decided in the wake of Icelandair's decision to cease negotiations with the Airfreyfélag, terminate all its airfreights and search for contracts with another charter company.
Then the pilots of the company had to take on the job of a security guard on a temporary basis.
Asked how she thinks the ballot will go, Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug L<0xC3><0xAD>ney says it’s hard to say.
“People are in pain after this Icelandair operation, when all the airline’s flights were cancelled and announced that the agreement would be with another airline.
Now it is clear whether it will affect them,” she said.
At the end of April, Icelandair operated 940 aircraft, but at that time 900 of them, about 95%, were abandoned.
Their deadline for resignation is a mistake, for those who have the best job, he is three months old and therefore ends by the month of July-August.
Icelandair has about 90% of its airfreights.
What happens if the agreement is not accepted?
“Then we would like to continue our discussions with our clients.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the airfreights have gone too far.”
Icelandair announces the end of the voting process and the conclusion of the second quarter of the year
The vote on the new charter agreement will end at 12 noon tomorrow morning.
Icelandair’s report for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary results indicate that the company’s revenue has fallen by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic voting on the Icelandic Airfrey Association’s charter agreement and the Icelandair Business Conference began on Wednesday, 22 July, and ends tomorrow, Monday, 27 July, at 12 noon.
Those who are eligible to vote on the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay corporate fees to the airline.
Icelandair and FF<0xC3><0x8D> signed a new electoral agreement on the night of Sunday, 19 July, but Icelandair had previously held talks with the airline after absconding of the previous agreement in a vote in early July.
Icelandair had then told all of the airline’s airfields and airfields on Friday but they were pulled back after a new charter agreement was signed.
Under the new charter agreement, airfreights need to fly five more hours a month for the same basis.
The agreement is valid until 2025, but the provisions of the Air Force and Air Force have been consolidated for the duration of a single flight.
The contract was introduced to FFI members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and described many flight scares that the newsroom then talked about dissatisfaction with the contract.
Most, however, seemed to agree that it would have to accept the contract to keep FFI alive.
Icelandair’s report for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, but the company’s EBIT, its operating income for the financial sector and tax, is negative by 100 to 110 million U.S. dollars or by 15 billion Icelanders, according to preliminary results.
Icelandair sent the Department of Emergency Accounts last Wednesday, but said the company's revenue amounted to about $60 million in the quarter or about 8.3 billion kroner.
At the end of the fourth quarter, about 154 million U.S. dollars were in hand and the equivalent was about 21 billion kroner.
Icelandair also plans to offer the company’s share capital in August.
Icelandair plans to conclude a deal with fifteen credit unions, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before being put into a partial tender.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
“A new virus just means that this has been a person who came from a foreign country.
This is not something that has been painting here in the country," says M<0xC3><0xA1>r Kristj<0xC3><0xA1>nsson, a senior doctor at the infectious disease department of the National Hospital, if they claim that "a new type of virus" has been detected here in the country.
Three were found at the border yesterday and two at the border.
One who was found to have participated in the social activities of the sports club at the Rey Cup, but the origin of the infection remains undiscovered and the infection is over.
Also, a person who arrived in the country on 15 July was diagnosed with an infection and two people who were in contact with him began to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Yesterday, an infection related to an infection that was reported on Monday and after an analysis of the Icelandic genetics, a “new type of virus that has not been detected here before” was detected.
Contagion is terminated in connection with the infection.
It should be noted that this is not a new virus but it is the same virus and has spread all over the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is better to talk about a new variant of that virus than a new type of virus.
Asked what it meant and whether it could say anything to the other wave of parallax is started, M<0xC3><0xA1>r says that as it is only a case to talk about and it could go so as to become nothing more of it.
“However, if there are domestic cases that are not related to a foreign country and are of the same heritage and this particular variant then it would be possible to draw a decision [on the second wave] but it is timeless to so support,” explains M<0xC3><0xA1>r.
Welcome to the Hot Pot
Is the secret to the happiness of Icelanders hidden in hot pots?
The BBC’s daily journalists lead the way in a fun video that sheds light on the country’s swimming pool and hot tub culture.
The Icelandic bathing culture is unique in the world and it is believed that there are no more bathing places in the world per capita.
The natural geothermal energy is at the heart of it, but it is also the tradition of swimming that reigns here.
Children’s health education was legalized in 1940, but older citizens are still not able to use their hot water for health purposes.
Swimming is described as a solid part of the country’s general well-being.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of position and position.
Free from cell phones, people talk together on personal notes about home and space or the benefits of the similar power of water: thinking and charging batteries of the soul and body.
On the Hill to apply for a hundred days in elections
There are hundreds of days until the United States goes to the polls and elects a president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a replacement, but he still has to ask for it.
Joe Biden, the Democratic Party’s likely pro-democracy campaigner, has a strong bias against Trump at the national level, according to the polls.
According to a recent survey by the AP, the U.S. Census Bureau believes the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump’s response to the new coronavirus pandemic is also highly unfavourable, with more Americans counting on it than before the president’s economic woes.
More specifically, only two out of every ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump’s response because of the crisis, and 48 percent say he’s been good at economics.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average FiveThirtyEight, Biden’s support is 49.9 percent nationwide, while Trump’s support is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift attention from his performance against his predecessor to Biden, pushing under the so-called cultural division and proposing policies that should turn to laws and regulations.
Biden’s presence, however, places a lot of competition on keeping Trump’s attention and is likely to win a split if the election is really about how Trump has come to work in the last four years.
Unfriendly Trump also appears to be planning to bring down the Republican Party’s MPs and fears that the Democrats could even reach the majority of the U.S. Senate’s senior division, which has so far been very good.
Politico said that in the days that the accompaniment of the groups and the promoters remained similar and that it is now that the Republican Party would sound its most outspoken in decades.
The environment has proved to be particularly bad in the 2016 budgets and it is now expected that this development will continue.
Trump has been trying in recent days to scare the people of the suburbs to follow him, including by saying that he will be Biden’s president, he will tear down the U.S. suburbs and push under the genitals.
Among other things, Trump has dropped legislation since Barack Obama’s time at the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the field.
He then urged “housewives” to expel the United States to read an article after the former deputy governor of New York, where she argued that Biden would destroy the U.S. outpost and take Trump under it.
“I’m going to ruin your neighborhood and your American dream.
I’ll keep it, and even make it even better!” said the president.
The population of the United States is an ever-growing group of voters.
According to the NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was reelected in 2004, the incumbent who has received the majority of the vote of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney won the majority of the vote from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Investigative studies have shown that even though Trump secured a substantial majority in the 2016 budget, his support there has been significantly reduced.
While there is a difference between the polls, Biden has recommended about a fifteen percent advantage over Trump in the field in the past.

Will the Olympic torch be lit at the end of the corridor?
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that has only been postponed by the World Championships, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the fame of the Olympic Games would be "the light at the end of the tunnels," and pointed out that
Africans have a year in addition to preparing themselves and the authorities in Japan are adding to the cost due to the delay.
They all end up in a big house.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue of the Olympic Games this year, the celebrations of the Japanese representatives were cancelled.
They chanted and chanted in return, eventually Tokyo had applied to hold the games in 2016 but lauded it split into lower levels for Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan had to take a bath in the attention of the world.
The games were scheduled to run from 24 July to 9 August, but have been postponed for a year and will start on 23 July 2021 and end on 8 August.
If it is not possible to keep the toys then, if the coronavirus becomes too much of a threat, the toys will be stopped.
No one wants to think about it until the end.
The Olympic Games are not a normal sporting event.
Nothing is to be saved, the show should always be great and looking to top the last game.
The selection of the city for the Olympics is based on the opinion of the selection committee on the city’s presentations.
The more generous the presentation is, the more likely it is to listen to the chorus.
Tokyo won $150 million in a bid to host the 2016 Olympic Games, which is worth a whopping 20 billion kroner.
The second time, when the 2020 Games were requested, 75 million dollars, about 10 billion kroons, were put into the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would receive the games this year, the Japanese authorities had thus spent more than 30 billion kroner for the project.
But that amount is just a drop in the sea depending on how much it costs to build an Olympic village, playground and generally to strengthen the interior of the country to cope with such resistance, prepare it and keep the games themselves.
Japan's organizers have said the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be underway these days but have been postponed for one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by a government reviewer in Japan that came out at the end of last year found that the cost was nearly double that figure.
It is likely that a full assessment of the cost of delaying the games will not be possible, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost of the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between 15 and 30 billion dollars.
There are such high numbers that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic state accounted for only about half of the Olympic Games, according to the lowest possible cost.
Olympic Games are events of the scale that they have become quite a circulation material of economists, who try to explore in numbers and view the benefits and tastes of the games.
In the worst case, it seems that many have concluded that the impact of the Olympics is later than so positive for the economy of those who hold them.
Dosage effects are some, for example, many jobs very much for a short period of time, but for a long time, cities sit pretty high with debt ceilings and dangerous operating costs of little-used human resources.
R<0xC3><0xAD>o in Brazil is in serious debt because of the 2016 games and has been in trouble with the cost of maintaining all the major sports activities that were built for the games.
It has been tested in numbers after the London 2012 Games, but it has been found that only 10 percent of those who got a job related to the Olympic Games in the city were previously unemployed.
This means that we are not talking about a new job, except in a small way.
In general, cities have not come out very well from the financial holding of the Olympics due to the ridiculous costs associated with the human resources built for the games.
However, the benefits are generally thought to be in the increased traffic of the tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities after the games, which, however, is very uncertain about the 2021 games.
It is also unknown whether we will have to take in all the number of spectators who usually download the games.
The main thing, however, is the honor that the cities seem to have chosen, but it is difficult to value for money.
Therefore, despite the huge cost, it can also be said that the joy that the players bring is not the nature that can be put on it values.
But while the show is pretty big and nowhere to be saved, of course it’s not just about money.
These are the athletes who are at the forefront.
For some Africans, it’s a surprise to just love to postpone the games.
Australia’s five-year-old woman and gold medalist in her article at the Olympics, Chloe Esposito, for example, is cashless and would have been away from a good game in the summer but eyes hope to be in competition form for the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among those athletes who are just rather satisfied with the timing, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to stop after the games this year, they would have been held at the right time, the suspension of the games in some cases means that they stop the competition before the players take place.
Simply do not rely on your body to go through the years in addition to rigorous exercises.
Few athletes were equally successful in the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Rio Olympics and the five-star Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold on her neck and one bronze.
Biles has met in several interviews in his home country of the United States in the past to discuss the Olympics.
She plans to play in 2021, but she’s not sure if she’ll still be in the top spot next year, after which she’ll be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is in the higher order for a five-year-old in the front row.
“This is a sensitive issue,” Biles says, but in an interview published on the Olympic Committee’s Instagram page, she was asked if she was going to reach the level at the 2021 Games and she did in Rio 2016.
“I don’t know if I’ll still be on top after a whole year of practice,” Biles says.
She has previously mentioned that her body does not tolerate the stress that accompanies gymnastics training much longer.
However, she is still competing for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it has been an uncomfortable feeling to have to suddenly stop practicing when the world crisis was at its highest level and the gym was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others while all sports activities were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympians could not buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic formula is certainly better than in most people.
“We have a solid plan now.
It was difficult to start exercising again first after the gym opened.
We started as soon as possible, but we’ve come to the full step again and I’m going to increase my workouts evenly and tightly according to how I feel this year.
Of course, we don’t quite know how these games will be or whether they will be held but we still practice because they will be, we can’t do anything else.
I’ve been putting too much on myself to leave the sport now,” Biles says.
With it, like many other mixed minds or perhaps more conscious that the situation could lead to the players not being held at all in 2021 but rather.
Predicting it is hopeless.
No one can know what the world’s oldest coronavirus will be like in July 2021, and nothing else to do but to prepare for the Olympics, given that they will be held in a year.
Maybe the Olympics will be lit at the end of the Covid pandemic.
The wedding was postponed due to a divorce.
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was due to marry former Bachelorette competitor Wells Adams this summer.
“I think there are other more important things to think about right now,” the actress said in a conversation with People.
“We definitely want to get married sometime and then have the dream wedding and have all the guests we love.
But we decided to hit it on time and focus on what is important right now and it is helping to share information about the importance of being with makeup and staying at home.
I look more at the world than the weddings these days.
There’s a lot going on and we need to focus our attention on what’s happening in the world.”
