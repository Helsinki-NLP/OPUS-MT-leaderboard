What are you doing, Tom?
Are you jealous of Tom's doing this?
You're still in a restaurant?
What did you think Tom was doing to you?
So?
So Tom makes a lot of noise.
When I saw Thomas, I said to him, "Go away."
What are you sick?
What about the library?
Con?
What's Tom's plan to do for you?
Have you ever had a boyfriend or girlfriend?
What shall we say then? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase?
Do you want Tom to take care of you?
Is Tom going to kill you?
So, Tom Trubusard's gonna do it for you?
Is Tom the trouble making you?
So Tom thinks you're trying to do him?
So how does Tom Camel do it?
Is there a way to get Tom anywhere he's been kidnapped?
Will Tom Camel be able to see me?
Is my partner or my partner a bad guy?
To sleep with Tom?
So you're gonna play Tom?
Sostar or Tom, you're a lot lower than me?
Sostar?
Divo!
That is why it says, “When he ascended on high, he led captives in his train.”
Ramosar!
Go on.
Go! Go!
Make sure you love Tom to make him.
Perhaps you'll tell Thomas that you're comfortable with him.
Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness?
You're a mess here.
Trubus gives you the personal Thomasa.
This is the reason why I am so eager to proclaim the gospel to you who live in Rome, too.
You're often talked about by Tom's class.
The one who has ears, let him hear!
You're the one on the right.
It's time for the mango.
You can watch a movie in the future.
