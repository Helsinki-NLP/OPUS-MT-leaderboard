Why didn't you ever tell me that?
Who told you I did it?
It's never too late.

I'm glad you're doing this.
Since I didn’t get an answer, I wrote it again.
What would you like to say about this?
You think it's a trap?

I wonder if Tom and Mary were planning on doing this.
I borrowed a car from Tom.

There's nothing.
Let me take a look.
Tom began to realize what was going on.
Promise me you'll come.
Take off your coat.
He runs to the station every morning.
They're running out of supplies.
Not here.
No one was satisfied.
I hope so.
I'm such an idiot.
I was trying to fall asleep.
Tom is always on the net.
I moved here from Boston.
He just sent me a text message.
Somewhere in this building.
Tomorrow we are open.
I did not expect such a turn of events.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
I asked him what his name was.
When do you want to go?
There must be some logic.
Did you work yesterday?
How did you convince Tom to help us paint the candles?
Have you been to the U.S. capital, Washington?

Can't you lift me up?
I'm not pregnant.
He didn't break.
I have a question.
There's not much left!
Tom said that Mary is probably still doing it.
I'm not sure I agree with him.
The boss let me go earlier today.
What time is the end of the world?
I'm never worried.
How sweet!
When I'm in a bad mood, I start singing.
I don't owe him anything.
Where's your key?
It's going to be pretty cold tonight.
I won't ask Tom for help.
How much did you pay to do that?
You don't have to leave.
One day we'll meet again.
You said you wouldn't do that.

I know you're here.
Now half to third.

There is no great hope.
It's not mine.

We're pretty much everything.
You have to be home by 2:30.
You're going to school on foot?
Is this Tom's girl?
Tom's just wasting his time.

My head hurts.
Repeat again, please.
I'll be with you in a second.

Nice weather, isn't it?
Come if you can.
I hate it!
You're a little too young for me.
Tom's too old for you.

It looks like Tom.
You don’t have to do that if you don’t want to.
I was just going to wash.
Delicious!
Did Tom mention any problems?
Where does Tom have to do this?
Mary wants me to be on her team.
No one is listening anymore.
You're brave.
You have to do it yourself.
That means Tom was right.
I'm sitting there.
Put it down.
Tom came to the last one.
The hostages will be released before Christmas.
Mary ate alone.
Are you really going to find them?
I can't stand the humidity.

I was nervous.
Tom recently changed his job.
Tom refused to give Mary what she wanted.

Get out of here!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is now.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widow.
I read this story in a book.
Does Tom still have a bike?
Speak briefly.
Tom is smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could do it.
I'm a teacher.
You had a good time, didn't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do that.
I hope Tom understands that.
She spends too much time on the internet.
You're charming.
Tom said he would complain.
Let's go meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't go through this.

John is two years older than me.
For better or for worse, but television has changed the world.
I'm a little fat.

What is the purpose of your trip?
Then he's looking for something.
He's probably innocent.

Who's missing?
When is she coming?
That's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm so glad I did it yesterday.
Will Tom still live next door to you?
I wanted to hit Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a magician.
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you often meet him?
You'd like Tom.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She has wine.
You're gonna stop.
She's been waiting for him for years.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
This is a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was in a two-thousand year.
Tom, I think we should do this.
It must be the right color.

I don’t think there will be any problems.
Tom broke up?
You need to cut.
Green is good for you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary is playing football.

I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a DJ.
Soon Tom will learn to swim.

I'm still doing this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He received the first prize.

The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.

Can you remember the first time we met?

He is, so to speak, a robot man.
Give an answer to the question!
You need to be in the hospital.
I can't find the braces.
It's a fake.
It wasn't Tom who asked Mary to do it.
He has green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom is often wrong.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don’t have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true that Tom has never been to Australia?
I understand now.
I don't think about it anymore.
I guess we're next.
I turned on the TV, the Grand Prix was broadcast there.
Tom is proud of his daughter.
Don't remember.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do this.
English is not my native language.
I didn’t have any friends in Australia.
You think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's the name of this girl?
We shouldn't have let her go.
Therefore, you should not do it again.

I scored thirty points.
If I don't do this, Tom's gonna get mad.
Are you not a psychologist?
Don't you write it down?
The big tree fell on the road, and as I was walking, it made my way straight.
I like Tom's company.
It’s not all gold that shines.
I don't have many friends.
Do you believe in the existence of God?
I live in Boston.
Tom is blind from birth.
I did not answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Aren’t you starting to get bored?
What do you like about men?
Why do people still smoke?
I'm not gonna work on you.
I can do it for her, unlike you.
I am a student and he is not.
I was just trying to do it.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought my son new shoes.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister Sakiko. She was born the same year as me, and now she is preparing for exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Have you completed your homework?
Monday is going to be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Maybe you should help Tom paint the fence.
Why do people behave like big monkeys, and vice versa?
Can you help me?
Stupid.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go to the doctor.
I submitted the visa documents.
It's snowing today.
She continued to work.
The train broke down when we went up the mountain.
Tom's driving.
If you ate fewer hamburgers, you’d probably be healthier.
Tom helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Mary's not going, is she?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go personally.
Please, show me how it's done.
Don't you ever meet anyone else?
All the benches are busy.
I haven't made a decision yet.
What's the date today?
Where's Dad?
Close the door.
I'm not gonna talk to Tom in French.
Apples don’t fall far from the apple.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
Uncle is your father’s brother or mother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She has red eyes.
They won't come back.
I was in jeans.
See you after the show.
I would like to ask a question.
That's my grandmother.
It's a cat.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
I went to the Church of Satan.
I still want to do it with you.
Tom has no money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
You don't mind?
I haven't seen you in ages.
You're obviously right.
Whose books are they?
You want to do this, don't you?
You want to kill me.
You see?
Tom walks the dog twice a day.
Let me take a look at this book by Tom.
The main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Shikoku, Honshu and Kyushu.
You're probably very busy.
Tom doesn't have a lot of money in the bank.
I think we should go now.
We didn't do it.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I won't help you.
It's gonna get worse.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compare to him in tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you get that?
She committed suicide.
We had our office equipped with computers.
You have to pay early.
Are you sure?
You think Tom's gonna die?
Are you not planning to stay?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom will do it right away.
Let's sing a song together.
Tom has three times as many books as I do.
You've missed a lot.
I'm wearing boots.
You can count on me.
His book has been the subject of criticism.
It will be brilliant.
I'm very scared.
You have to help her, and fast!
It's much worse.
I'm under the fly.
You haven't wasted your time.
Who knows when Tom will do it?
Tom testified in the case of Mary.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
Can I ask what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What do we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You should quit smoking.
I think Tom's cheating.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You're not like her at all.
Can you play the violin?
Will you hand me the salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks French very well.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
It was very popular with both students and teachers.
You can't help the tears.
Tom plays football and runs the race.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll meet with Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know that Tom can't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung up the phone.
I'll be right back.
The church is located at the foot of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why did you do that?
I'll have some coffee, please.
Tom tries to convince Mary to do it.
Tom's calling you.
You have to tell Tom to do it.
He speaks Esperanto with a small French accent.
It's not your knife.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't get around to it.
She has good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom will come to my party.
Tom told me he doesn’t like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a lady's matchmaker.
I'll take care of it.
Did you find any errors?
I'd like to see your mother.
You're a magician?
Am I beautiful?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
We're leaving.
You're gonna let Tom move you?
You're a beautiful woman.
There is hope.
When I was a kid, I was very shy.
Did Tom actually move to Boston?
Tom picked up Mary's beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Children grow up so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He returned to the hotel.
When did you get back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
The bearers of language follow the rules of their language subconsciously, even without realizing them.
Tom's on vacation.
What happens if I press this button?
The hunters aimed their guns at the elephant.
No one cares.
They were trying.
Tom and Mary are still here?
Tom's wife is Canadian.
Do you have an allergy to something?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do that.
I would like to withdraw money.
I'll shake Tom's hand.
They'll be all right.
Half of these apples are rotten.
He is no longer a member of this club.
You don’t have to worry about tomorrow’s exam.
Did Tom vote?
I'll be right back.
Tom won't force Mary to do it.
Tom didn't start.
Instead of going to school, he stayed at home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You don't have to trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
You're not running away.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to complain about?
Where did you spend the holidays?
Did you get a Christmas present from Tom this year?
I’m still a little bored at home and so many things seem strange to me.
Sometimes I have problems with my memory.
Where's Mom?
He died three hours after the accident.
Do you speak Macedonian?
We shouldn't talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Tom's all right?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
You know the reason?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks in three foreign languages.
Tom is a bit behind the schedule.
Tom's not a hero.
Is it possible to catch a taxi?
Hurry up, because you're late.
It will be difficult.
Tom always behaves like that?
I like to play golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn’t want to speak so loudly.
Our team needs your help.
You will never fail.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It will all work out, you’ll see.
She threw it away.
Tom's safe.
I finally got my driver's license.
I'm not a student.
It was a pity Mary.
I'm just watching the news right now.
Tom is constantly checking his phone.
Like a wife?
You're quite right.
Tom's not rich, Mary's rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everyone was late, except for me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I don’t plan to build a boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom has a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something. Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed in your efficiency.
Have you ever had a car before?
Were you at work?
What are you reading?
I'm sorry I ate those oysters.
Good-bye.
Please, write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She completely ignores me.
Tom goes for a walk in the evening.
I was talking.
She went to the airport.
She is studying Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know this was going to happen?
What's in there?
If natural language can be compared with a tree that develops over time, then Esperanto can be compared with a plastic tree that was created artificially.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's in Boston.
You know where we're going?
Tom doesn’t know what he needs to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
I know when you're burning.
I know you just did your job.
We'll walk.
Tom said what just happened?
I finally realized that I'm not in love with you.
Did you tell Tom I was joking?
So it was awfully boring.
Tom said I was beautiful.
I'll be in the lab.
Please, wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you understand?
Do they suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Bring the garbage.
Won't you come back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Your sister, as always, is wonderful.
It will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed by fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How horrible!
Are you in a hurry?
I don’t have two cats.
When you hire him for a job, you should take into account his youth.
We're sure it wasn't a coincidence.
It's his intrusive idea.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom didn't want to leave the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe it.
I was in a white dress.
Check again.
Tom has a son-in-law.
I know it will be impossible.
Do you have a headache?
Children follow their friends, not their parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play with his friends outside.
Whatever happens, stay calm.
Tom sent Mary a message.
He's always happy.
When Mary arrived at the bus stop, the last bus had already left.
Tom's in a black coat today.
I'll wait till 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We usually spoke in French, though.
Bananas are delicious.
They eat.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
They're nothing now.
Did you try to talk to them?
It was a lot harder to do than it seemed.
Her friends laughed at her.
Let me talk to Tom, please.
Tom seemed to understand what I was saying.
I doubt that Tom can win.
Aliens fly in and pick up our work from us. Earth for the earthlings! Let's deport the Martians!
Don't worry.
Bell invented the phone in 1876.
You're going by train?
Tom said Mary was fine.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still sleeping, aren't they?
Is that why you still like Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad and never came back.
Collect your toys together.
It was a lot harder to do than it seemed.
I think I did a good job.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I'm getting better.
Are these people crazy?
That's why it's interesting.
You're done already?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's easy to do.
Tom's dead.
I like to be alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but taller than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I have never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was a jam.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I wanted to sell it anyway.
Tom said that, in his opinion, Mary will not be.
You missed something.
I immediately called Tom.
You looked interested.
That'll help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We really don't have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked very hard to achieve his goal.
Ken has two cats.
I understood what my mistake was.
I like to travel.
The phone is not working.
Here's what we want.
Tom's in sunglasses.
Tom paints well.
All you have to do is press the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can I rent a costume for Halloween?
Tom is busy and can't help you right now.
We don't have money.
You want to see a student.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm starting to get hot.
Why don't you sleep?
Do you really think that someone is listening?
You don't need a gift!
Tom, you could say, nice.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I had to leave earlier.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like her?
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's got a crush on him.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
You understand?
Tom wasn't rude to me.
How to say “thank you” in Japanese?
She's sleeping.
Tom’s wife asked him to quit his job.
Can't you open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This chair is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted an orphan.
I played baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got a ticket for free.
You are such an impatient person.
What's going on here?
Tom said you're speaking French.
I did everything I could.
No, sir, she's free.
I am very interested in learning French.
Good for the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a flashlight that I could borrow from you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't believe anyone.
I'm glad you're happy with your job.
Are you working somewhere nearby?
You admit it, don't you?
I have business tomorrow.
I'm rude.
You are always wrong.

He's selling cars.
They were my friends.

Tom knows how to drive.
I am reading novels of wisdom.
I was going to tell Tom, but I forgot.
I'm a heroine.

Does it matter?
Can I get you a minute?
Tom may not even be on the team.
I wonder if Tom can be trusted.
What happened to her?
You're drinking?
I'm mad.
When did he arrive?
Where's your plush bear?
What's up, Tom?
Maybe this year we will finally win the Eurovision Song Contest.

What really happened here?
Oh, my God!
I'm naked.
Are you planning on doing this somehow?
Am I speaking clearly?
I'm free this afternoon.
Tom may have been punished for doing so.
No matter what, Tom is happy.
There is no need to rush.
Are you satisfied?
At first I didn't believe him.
The phone is not working now.
Tom and his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Come on in.

I'm the strongest.

I'm good at it.
Why was he fired?
Tom said Mary was gone.
I don’t have enough money to buy it.
Mary said she wasn't sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My undisputed opinion is that this is a horrible movie.

As you wish.
I could change.
That's important.
Are you trying to be funny again?

How do you feel now?
How many boys are in your class?

She holds the flowers in her hand.
Have you talked to him yet?
We're used to it.
The old man's in his 90s.
This coffee is so hot I can't drink it.

You're from Boston?
Have you known her since 1990?
You're good at doing this, aren't you?

When did you come to China?
Do you agree with what Tom is doing?

You're not.
We went home.
I said hello to Tom.
