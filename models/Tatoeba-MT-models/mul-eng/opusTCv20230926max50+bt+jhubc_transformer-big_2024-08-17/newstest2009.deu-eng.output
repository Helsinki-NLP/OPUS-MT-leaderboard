The Prague Stock Exchange is falling short of closing.
After the steep decline in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with the shares of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ reached almost half of the normal day-to-day business.
At the beginning of Tuesday’s business, the Prague stock market was on the verge of Monday’s collapse when it fell by an additional six percentage points.
This time the reason for the break-in was on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the market’s response to the outcome of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which it had refused to support a stabilization plan for the local financial sector.
The Case of Stocks in Asia
A dramatic case experienced on Tuesday the stocks on the stock exchanges in Asia, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Index in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but was able to compete a portion of the losses later, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which observes the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Stocks on the Sydney stock exchange lost more than five percent, but then decreased losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent according to the local index.
“The timing of the rescue operation in the US is uncertain and will affect the financial markets worldwide,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as those in the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and pass the draft to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the break-in.
A Bloodbath of American Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion CZK) should be spent.
The lawmakers ignored President Bush’s call to support the plan.
In Bush’s view, the plan would regulate the underlying causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the biggest break-in in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, with a similar break-in last recorded in 1987.
The index had already declined before the vote, but there was hardly any indication that the draft would not be passed in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free case.
Congress agrees: U.S. government can pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial aid for the American financial system.
This is to be agreed at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers reached a breakthrough in talks over the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of a financial aid to the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean victory yet.
Members of Congress must discuss some of the details of the agreement before they can publish the final version of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated at the U.S. Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
According to various sources in the Senate, the plan could probably be voted on by Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, a message that the plan should be adopted should be the first significant psychological factor for a revival of the financial markets.
After that, however, there is a "renewal" due to the complicated mechanisms, how to help the markets also in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package should look like to stabilize the market,” Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to him, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the lawmakers met on the night of Sunday with the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsold mortgage assets from financial companies, which plunge financial firms into serious losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
You still have to continue the health plan, but I think we’re on target,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis is also clearly falling in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the Nevada Democratic Senator, Harry Reid, the lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
This is to reassure investors before trading on the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a congressional decision could affect the trading on Monday.
So far, however, it is not entirely clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, but there is also uncertainty as to whether the last minute negotiations could still fail on a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be passed in the next few days.
But the law will see some changes.
The total amount allocated to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is expected to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
However, Congress can block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, namely at another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush Appreciates Progress in Negotiations
While the President has a veto in this decision, Congress can vote against his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has remained, which was based on obtaining funds for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, the value of which has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
“We have worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, the Senate then on Monday,” Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
With the progress, President Bush also showed himself satisfied with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was satisfied with the progress made on Saturday and “appreciates the bilateral effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the senior negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed on a responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, concluding concessions, and a timetable for funding the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the program and sets up a committee to oversee the fund.
This is to be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this and made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems with repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages it buys, with the goal of lowering the monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
“And that’s because you don’t know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government share the losses among each other," Marek told the server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week, Marek’s view is not decisive.
“It’s much more important that Congressmen agree to support the plan and that they say goodbye to it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that there is going to be an adoption is the most important thing at the moment,” Marek said.
Duel on knife cutting: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost any phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still call.
So of course it looks like it’s better to just buy a phone.
After all, there are plenty of reasons why you should hire an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the requirements of the future owners.
Surely you can hardly buy yourself a great expensive record player at home to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this either.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues in the shelf, you probably dream of at least one.
This is also the case with music on trips, i.e. with compressed music, simplified expression - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but a Pink Floyd fan will probably hardly get a headphone for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The lifespan of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play a lot more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they don’t even create infertile.
No modern device is as universal to use as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the sims, it can play music and videos, both recording, it sometimes has a better, sometimes a worse camera and may also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings with it disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to download it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy boosters.
Only a few phones can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually it is much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more powerful.
That’s why you should expect the cheap phones to be able to play music for no longer than a few hours.
If you call from time to time, you’d prefer to buy a charger for the office for safety – this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won’t have this problem, even the less good ones keep at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with a one-time charge.
Another problem is if you want to play music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB port, in addition, not every phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers will finish without reduction with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
With players, you don’t need any special software until you get exceptions (iPod).
You only need to power the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players install a music library themselves, arranged by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices only make up the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some may both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, phones can do more
When choosing a specific device, you should inquire in particular about the battery life, storage capacity, quality and type of sound and of course also the operating comfort.
If music is especially cool for you and you only listen to it every day for a short time, for example on the tram, then any phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
This is what almost any phone can do.
You also don’t have to specifically control which music formats a phone or player can process.
MP3 creates all, and most of the music you get will be in this format.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also make it possible to buy music online.
You only need to call up the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile internet, and you can already buy a song or album.
This service can already be a striking argument for why you should hire a music store.
Unfortunately, the provider’s offer is poor and is usually limited to quick radio hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of music sales (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most of the phones carry with them.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in your pocket while the player is at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least one wireless free-of-charge device with you.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that has almost every phone, but only the fewest MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of the music handle will be the price for many.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most people that no normal headphones are involved.
The best and most technically mature phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player is that it is easy to use.
The simplest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really use anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the disc player is obvious.
There is no threat of a collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile internet and a subsequent horrifying bill for data transmissions.
What device should be used
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns will suffice.
But attention.
For the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive ones can read 8GB of memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy another cheap MP3 player, then reach for Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB), you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be among the more demanding listeners, prefer to take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have stand-alone control buttons for MP3, and the control comfort comes from a single MP3 player.
This is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman-series phones have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) will allow you to MP3 players of the above mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer practically all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classics to lower prices.
Maybe he won’t be able to wait any longer.
The fact that the Czech mobile service providers work among the most expensive in Europe at all, we have often reported about this on Mobil.cz.
By the way, this was also confirmed by the telecommunications authority <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which pointed out that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
According to the latest steps taken by the European Commission in regulating roaming charges, it is likely that there will be a paradoxical situation – for some customers of Czech mobile phone providers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really makes a campaign statement.
It may sound paradoxical, but in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile providers like to argue that there is an extremely high level of competition in the Czech market.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who had often stated in the past that there is no place for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It’s probably true that a classic provider with its own network doesn’t have a lot of chances anymore (by the way, he’d probably hardly even find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual provider.
It was precisely the entry of virtual providers into the mobile phone market that brought with it a significant price reduction, which the classical mobile phone providers had to respond to.
Before companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market in the UK, there were similar voices as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, you don’t need to look for examples for long.
In February, we reported this about the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and thus become the country’s fifth largest provider.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon, among others, in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a classic provider.
You do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually come out as low-cost companies – they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which, however, is often accompanied by a less extensive service offering.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to bet on a non-clickable target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
“Real guys choose Mobilking – the provider they like and can trust,” said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could be used in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, he is relatively satisfied from the point of view of the service offer."
In the Czech Republic without chance, the mobile phone providers mean
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile service provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobileking.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look particularly hopeful.
There will be more of a market entry of Mobilking in other countries of our region," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokeswoman for Penta Financial Group, told Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
For a long time now, your interest in starting a virtual mobile provider has been shown by the GTS Novara group, which wants to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the earlier, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this option with all Czech mobile phone providers.
With some of them, we have already been able to make progress in negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl, a spokesman for the group.
Maybe there will be better times.
Unofficial information suggests that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
Until now, however, this is surrounded by an invincible wall of silence.
“At this point, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has great specificity compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by a subject with a complex and serious project in this area,” says Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> from the press department of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other providers also point out the specifics of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> adds in rare agreement with O2’s statement: “So far, we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build further.”
She added: “In T-Mobile’s network, there will hardly be a virtual provider until the end of the year.
At this moment, we should already have a concrete offer in order to be able to think like this in the short term."
Vodafone is more focused on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
This is exactly what we consider from the customer’s point of view as the best.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to look for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet.”
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand
The move by mobile providers is easy to understand, another provider was called more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
So why should it be easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull on a string when it comes to something also proves the long back and forth about the emergence of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> came at the time when U:fon came on the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This is also evidenced by the publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> websites.
But now U:fon is just a good argument as to why you shouldn’t allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has recently also been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile phone provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and above all its services."
In view of this approach, however, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just about the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which unfortunately, unlike the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries, does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It is owned exclusively by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, related to this whole problem to his very typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile service provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile service provider and a virtual service provider over the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not interesting enough for the classical providers,” said Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa from the Department of Foreign Affairs of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS in his reply to our request.
Such a formulation would not come as a surprise from representatives of the providers.
This is more than a matter of concern from an authority that represents consumer interests and should, among other things, ensure that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, if Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual providers work quite normally, it is to be observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a price reduction in mobile phone services."
But probably the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are not in the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
In this case, it is really shocking that almost all the three mobile phone providers are already in agreement with each other, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is at hand.
Just like the absolutely same gasoline price at the gas stations is certainly only chance and the result of a fierce competition.
"The Authority has not found any evidence in this matter that suggests action against the competition, and therefore has no reason to intervene in the matter in any way.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so it does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for its actions on the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile market for virtual providers are also likely to be missing from the regulatory authority for telecommunications,” Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many contentious points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, after telecommunications from the perspective of economic competition is a single market.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile service providers has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different perspective - for the market entry of a virtual provider, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile provider has – logically – the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning to the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile service providers are acting remarkably similar.
Complaints by a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novara) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The discharge of responsibility to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is then a fairly common trick in the telecommunications services, with which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recently adopted novella of the Telecommunications Act, it has not succeeded in implementing the extension of the competences of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have tried to improve the situation.
The representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS only need to know all too well, but they probably have different interests.
It's all right when no one looks
First of all, the functioning of any pseudo-virtual provider, of which there are equal numbers in the Czech mobile networks remains unabated.
It is companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunication services, but only partially public.
Usually, these are companies that operate in the field of multi-level marketing.
Their own mobile phone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only go to selected ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company acts towards the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile phone providers prohibit a similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which can lead to an end of the cooperation with the relevant society," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> replied to our question about this problem.
However, it is quite improbable that such a thing does not occur among those responsible for the mobile phone providers.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, they can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such a procedure.
The activities of these companies do not result in negligible profits for them, but at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out about possible problems: "The law allows for such types of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are used only by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot have it in full like the normal customers of mobile phone providers.”
But at least that would have been a strange thing to do.
There is also another question for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Mobile providers close their eyes to such an approach, why do they block themselves against a virtual provider?
It is to be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has quite strong competences for the detection of such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to satisfy itself with the declaration of the providers, they do not know anything about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been stressed several times in the text, the entry into the market of virtual providers brought a significant price drop in the various services.
Virtually in all countries where virtual providers have been created, the classic providers have tried to prevent their creation practically more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market too small, or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies that tried to safeguard the interests of the mobile phone providers, but those of their customers, intervened precisely at these moments.
Whether it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operator was created, followed by more.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing themselves all over the case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot escape the impression that uncertainty in the competences in these cases is more than favorable.
But let's not throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon be in motion again.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting other interested parties (to discriminate).
And the Czechs will finally not be calling more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Statehood Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek presented the new recordings of the National Anthem Where my homeland is.
The anthem was re-recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo vocals, in chorus and in an instrumental version.
The song was sung by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the anthem versions are Otakar Jeremi<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the iHNed.cz server, you can listen to all four versions at once.
For B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek, the Czech national anthem is one of the most beautiful.
Earlier, he had told Czech Radio that he had selected singers with young, representative voices for the solo variants, which are distinctive and popular.
“From the beginning, I tried to follow a clear sentence with both of them and then with the choir, so that the text could be understood well, so that a harmony could be created,” says the conductor.
The Czech National Anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov mj<0xC3><0xB8>j first appeared on the stage of the stand theatre in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl, the music came from Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first stanza of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the birth of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What does the "new" anthem sound like?
For the first time on Wednesday, the Prague transport companies also transport on a chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague’s transport companies as a date on which the first passengers to enter a subway, tram or bus will carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently be purchased by about one hundred thousand people who own the chip card Opencard.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, a 90-day or an annual voucher (valid from 1 January 2009) and can play it on their chip card at the information centers and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Rodra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>r<0xC3><0xA1>d<0xC3><0xA1>n, Ko<0xC5><0xBE>y<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>n, Rodra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>n, Ko<0xC5><0xBE>y<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC5><0xBE>an, the railway stations.
The coupons are also available from yesterday via the Internet on the pages of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use internet sales can really forget the issue window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly for their paper tickets in long queues so far.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, it is played on the open card in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"There is also a switch with trained staff available at these places, which advises interested parties when buying online and also plays the coupon on the map," says the spokesman of the project Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on self-service machines on the opencard, which are installed in some subway vestibules.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, remember ticket holders, passengers may have noticed them already in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"At present, there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
The coupon is controlled by an automatic machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work from tomorrow is simple.
You only need to enter the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon will play itself.
The electronic coupons will apply tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants of the municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia get to the capital.
“In the trains that belong to the integrated traffic of Prague, the accompanying train readers have readers with which they can check the validity of the coupons according to time and zone”, explains Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal from the organization Ropid the ticket control. This organization sets out the timetables for the Prague traffic operation.
The suburban buses have card readers at the checkout with the driver.
Upon entry, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked point on the side of the box.
In this way, the driver checks the validity of the played coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the vouchers played, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal said.
A passenger who does not ride suburban buses and does not know when the validity of the coupon ends can again go to the self-service vending machines where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information about the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the United States
The Sudeten Germans had asked the United States to join the B<0xC3><0xB6>hmer Forest in 1945.
This emerges from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we can’t be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the umbrella of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans were supposed to turn to the US president in 1945.
This is evidenced, among other things, by a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudetengau" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich agreement by Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” it said in a letter signed with the words “people whose fate lies at the heart of the Sudeten”.
Since the accession to Czechoslovakia leads the Sudeten Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - to suspect that they would expect brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to protect them from now and then.
“We can’t believe that you, regardless of the view of a quarter of a million people in this area, are appealing to a foreign state that is trying to suppress and eliminate minorities and has done nothing to help the Allies win,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of reprisals by the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. President has doubts about the opinion of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in the Bohemian Forest on whether the residents wanted to become part of the United States or live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat na<0xC3><0xAF>ve in today’s knowledge of post-war history, it does, however, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses, draw a good picture regarding the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even though the Bohemian Germans at least had to suspect that they would be negotiating their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them agreed on such a possibility at all.
Some waited for the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Again, others believed that they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
It is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was employed in the war as a Budweiser German at the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to Holstein in a prisoner of war camp, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
“They thought if they came home, they would be able to fit the Czech,” Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, in his opinion, expected him to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
If you don't, pay!
An emotionally charged campaign is aimed at motorists
The most expensive security action on the streets in Czech history.
Also, the emotionally charged media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday, was characterized.
The authority of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek promises to remove drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The 150 million kroner campaign will run on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is designed to take the drivers off of too fast driving and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remember to cheer up before the start of the journey.
The campaign is mainly aimed at young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
If you don't, pay!
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a sign.
And in a blood hole, the word "pay" is then.
This means that you can pay for a moment of inattention with your own life.
The spots will "shock" the viewers by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see quite normal pictures with drastic shots of victims of accidents.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and the number of traffic deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and whips for motorists
"For the driver, the motto applies to sugar bread and whips.
Sugar bread means that when you drive at red, for example, you save time.
The whip is then the threat of a penalty or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk,” says the traffic psychologist of the Na Homolce Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n Hospital.
And that’s why information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist says.
Even less effective, in his opinion, are tables that make the drivers aware of a danger.
"If you set up a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the environment, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The President of the Provisional Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, has expressed his support for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. the Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace can be concluded in exchange for this with Palestine and Syria.
He stressed this in an interview that was printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar high percentage (of Israeli territory) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He conceded that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want tractors or bulldozers rolling over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in reference to two attacks in the city in July in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Templars and sacred and historical places" that lie on the territory of the Old Town.
“The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he added.
Detachment from the Golan Heights
Olmert spoke out for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an indispensable condition for concluding a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on Damascus’s side.
"My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria alone and solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert said.
“The Syrians only know too well what they have to give up in order to get back the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to give up the constant support they have given to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terrorist network of Al-Khaida and the jihadists (Iraq).
Questions after the accident: Are Stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance bus, the re-run is not allowed
In the context of the tragic accident of a student agency bus company near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travelers are allowed to go and exit during the bus ride.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road transport," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus.
The young woman was sitting next to the driver at the least safe place in the car at that moment, although she had two more seats available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply, in which the steward wears out coffee or newspapers.
A role also plays if the bus is still equipped with parking spaces for the vehicle ticket.
If this is not provided in the bus, passengers must sit.
Student Agency’s long-distance buses have no standing places, as confirmed by the company’s director, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, to Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this did not agree with the movement of travellers at first.
This was later withdrawn, and we have reached a consensus after which passengers may go to the toilet during the trip if they have their seat,” he said.
The law does not recognize a steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no legislation that prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The law on road transport only knows the concept of a vehicle companion; however, its rights and obligations do not define it," Hanzelka said in a statement.
On the other hand, the director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> believes that the law covers this problem later on.
"It depends on whether the bus in the product permit also has parking spaces.
That’s all,” he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are parking spaces and the maximum speed is limited, commuter buses with parking spaces and a higher allowed speed and long-distance buses without parking spaces with the highest permissible speed and seats, which are equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP traffic safety specialist Jaroslav Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"With a liquid mode of travel, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Even here, it’s not certain when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can hit her head.”
But if a bus breaks sharply, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations," he says and also believes that this problem is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency is the only bus company offering services from Stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider his profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the job of the steward is risky, I'm going to delete him.
Coffee and newspapers are available to guests upon check-in.
That would also reduce the cost,” he said.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin bases the lack of stewards in his bus, but his company operates only a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency.
“We don’t have any Stewarts, but we’ve been fighting it from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends in some fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
A young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, was killed in the accident.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent off the runway without blinking and had blocked the bus from travelling.
The driver of the bus tried to escape through a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part of the truck.
The fact that the two seats for the stewards were sold is disputed by Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman’s family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but it also expects a financial compensation from the guilty party.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation on which a thirty-member expert team of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
“However, this has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving," says Fachmann Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards to be something that could significantly endanger the safety of the passengers,” says Hanzelka, while controlling the safety of buses is within the competence of the police and the labour protection authorities.
D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
In many words, there is no shortage of staff in the letter from the WestLB Board of Directors.
By merging units of the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf Monetary Institute with the Frankfurt Deka Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen financial group" could be created, according to the letter announced on Monday.
WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And at all, such a connection could be the decisive impetus for further mergers in the national banking sector.
This is how it is read if a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the beaten WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalian state government has just made it clear, time is pressing to find a solution for the future.
However, the WestLB has been talking about a connection between the deca bank, which knows savings customers because of their investment funds, and the WestLB has been talking for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank chief Franz Waas made it clear at the end of August that in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e with a state bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each of which is carried out by half of the national banks and the Sparkasse Associations, has instructed the Board to hold discussions with the WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have been open, according to the Financial Times, just started.
The deka bank, which is one of the most important employers at the Frankfurt financial centre with its 3000 employees, is not the first time it has been talking about consolidation in the savings fund sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that the Deka Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing came of this trinity.
The plans had scarcely been made public, the Hessian state government objected to Helaba's participation in them.
The other two houses did not find each other either.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been thought games about a connection of the deca bank with state banks.
At last, however, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Merl, chairman of the Helaba board of directors, spoke out against plans to merge with his house.
Regardless, however, the realization seems to mature that a collapse of the various houses of the public sector is necessary.
After the national election in Bavaria is over, BayernLB’s connection with the Landesbank Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg could be the first one.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure on further mergers increases, you will gradually assume that the partners will do so.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has survived the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In a joint venture with West LB, the Sparkasse and Giroverband Hessen-Th<0xC3><0xBC>ringen, which has an 85 percent stake in Helaba, pushed a bar at the beginning of the year.
Stay in the North LB.
But such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, it is about how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl, the crucial question with which business model to ensure the future viability of the state banks, said that the German Savings and Money Association had not yet answered.
In the end, there could also be a breakdown of the West LB, which, however, is not self-evident there.
This is also the case in the letter of the local board of directors, it is certainly intended a "total solution" for the house.
As with the joining of individual units with the Deka Bank, a hat will still show.
The second Wiesnweekend is known as the "Italian Weekend"
For Elena it is the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearer and proves to the approximately 200 Oktoberfest travelers, what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus parking next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", are expected to start at 6.30 pm this evening.
Three buses are reserved especially for the Italians, in one bus only Brazilians travel.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing along with their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with pelvis lining and glasses with wide silver bars, belongs to the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the meadow, at 22.30.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
75 euros costs the trip, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Bier, brewed faithfully according to the Bavarian Purity Offer, the health insurance and the German-speaking travel guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the highway towards "Brennero".
There is no beer, not yet.
Soon it will be quiet in the bus, the travelers sleep.
All right, you'll still need your strength.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian landmarks on the motorway 8 just before Munich take a break.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past seven o’clock in the morning, the other 50 buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds one last address, explains the attack plan.
First, set up the yellow cap.
On the left is "Oktoberfest", in Fraktur, next to the Internet address of Marcos Reiseb<0xC3><0xBC>ro: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, “When the doors to the beer tent go up, it’s called running!”, Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we will block, and not distribute all yellow hats on the same benches, in the room!"
The measure, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don’t forget to drink money.
"The security people show that we're doing well!
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone!”
Thirdly, "Tonight, I'll be back here at half past eleven."
And it's all about wisdom.
Along the way, a yellow cap ties to the trees, signs and even to the electoral poster of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
You want to be armed for withdrawal.
It is the second Easter weekend, known as the "Italian Weekend".
There is no exact data on numbers; the speech is of 50,000 who make their way across the Alps and enter the beer tent, ten percent of all visitors are expected to have extra-outreached from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which carries out a national statistics in which the Italians before the British (about 60 operations) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical supplies first.
Especially popular with Italians is the Hofbr<0xC3><0xA4>uzelt.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck stressed only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relatively" and also hinted that the German banking sector will not be spared from the crisis-prone developments.
It has now entered on the weekend.
The Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed in the Dax, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loans amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only needs to interest the part that it also takes in.
The money comes from both private and public-law banks.
The background is losses in the daughter Depfa.
The state financier had refinanced himself in the extremely short term, according to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he loaned money – which is now no longer possible due to distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserves had shrunk by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio had slightly declined from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the previous year’s period, revenues from attributions to receivables and certain securities as well as from the resolution of deposits in the credit business decreased by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only with higher revenues from refunds of deferred settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from interest refunds according to the tax order and from the business provision for group companies, the revenue decrease had fallen by around 16 percent.
The former state financier had initially speculated after his privatisation in 1990 on commercial real estate loans, which had then been decoupled from the Aareal Bank.
Because there was too little profit in classical state funding, the Deffa had then stepped up infrastructure projects and engaged in the financing of community projects of private investors and the state (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a "substantial material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is quite indeterminate.
The fact is that the dividend has been deducted.
By 2007, it had been cut by two-thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a significant state and infrastructure financier since the takeover of Depfa.
It relies more heavily on refinancing in the interbank market than other institutions, as it has no customer input.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks is again largely failing as the banks hold their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds to refinance part of the Deffa’s credit portfolio every year – around 50 billion euros.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are covered with the loan for an foreseeable period of time and the company is shielded “from the influence of the currently largely dysfunctional international money markets.”
Other sources suggest that the funds secured the refinancing until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke said, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to take advantage of the money markets in the foreseeable future.
Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority (BaFin) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is to be expected for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even inconceivable that funding does not have to be fully utilised.
But also the opposite is not to be worn out.
After the late Sunday evening after the bank's takeover was still before the insolvency, even the at least provisional bailout was unable to calm the spirits.
The share price falls by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the bond prices are quite good.
While the primary debts are hardly moving, the rates of subordinated bonds are more pronounced.
In particular, the liabilities of the former subsidiary W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg Hypo and, of course, the maturity beyond 2009 are affected.
If hypo-real-state bonds appear to be a speculative investment alternative, then their value after the sharp tightening of the banking crisis and the institute itself, which had only gotten into the house with the takeover of the deffa, must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the note banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, as long as it can be assumed that pensions will be repaid on time.
Or there is one thing that hardly anyone can hope for right now – that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports that overlap with the partial nationalisation, the likelihood of bordering security has at present only become a legitimate hope.
This should prepare long-term creditors, in particular, for some sleepless nights with the decision as to whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
In any case, short-term investors can use a final line to form a loss statement for future payment tax payments on price gains in later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is due to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls begin to pee: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Before school, I had bamboo.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I did not walk.
The beginning of the lesson does not seem to be as strictly defined at the Tachibana as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students enter from eight o'clock until a short round of meetings with the teacher, the 'home room', begins at twenty-nine o'clock.
But before the class started, I was in a position to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of guy who likes to talk in front of people, even in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my host mother, plus blouses, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the pulpit and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and have my birthday in a week.
At the time I was very happy that I had already started learning the language well two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all nodded, nodded and waved and all the time I heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly huddled in my place.
The girl next to me grinned pretty wide, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was actually stunned.
Everyone was talking to each other and chirping and asking me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all packed their Bentos.
My host mother had also made me such a lunchbox - this is something other than the delicious German breads.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in the tofu coat.
Usually I don’t have a bladder, which is exactly what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It is clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, up to the salty plums maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared Bento, which she then prepares especially artificially - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely at the break snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can watch this here too.
‘Why did Japan pay off?’ my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said:
"Because it fascinates me now."
After all, I’ve been reading my favorite mangas for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and culture in it, I also started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
It was clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, sitting and customs.
And that is where you put great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven’t felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have feelings.
Does a rat or a sheep run away in danger mean that they also feel fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Just how can one check whether they feel the same when they behave the same way we do?
In the Internet magazine "Edge", contributions from famous scientists have been published for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and ask questions of the feeling or the general consciousness, we enter inviolable territory because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it becomes dead, flees, or attacks.
Humans behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a similar subjective experience.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and in the execution/control functions).
This wide region is much higher in humans than in the other primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic characteristic may lie in the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be acquired, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, neither measure nor, because of the special hardware, can be analyzed on the basis of our own experience, his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies of the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one is more inclined to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the emergence of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I lead them back to the fact that an emotional system like fear is activated in one of its own activity conscious brains.
So what we call “fear” is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies working memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, which distinguish primates and, in particular, humans.
Connected to the linguistic nature, fine degrees of sensation arise, because with the help of words and grammar, we can differentiate and categorize states in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
By contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, suggests that sensations from more primitive activities in the body-feeling regions of the cortex and brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it could indeed be involved in cross-species sensations.
In theory, I can’t argue with it, but I think it’s unproven.
Pankseep argues what appears to be fear in rats and humans, probably feels like this in both cases: But how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
Does a sheep run away from danger, or do they also feel fear?
In my view, mere behavioural similarity cannot yet prove a level playing field.
Although the neural comparison helps further: rats and humans have similar brain stems, on the other hand, do not even make a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove it for humans, how would you want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behaviors than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, there are advances at the neural level, if the same is measured in rats and humans.
As I don’t research language and consciousness in rats, nor feelings, I don’t know if they exist.
You might think this short-sighted, but I'd rather go ahead than run against a wall all the time.
I am a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of the Uefa in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the EM together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or reconstruction of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts hang behind.
Perhaps even the number of EM stages will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
We must now work at the highest speed,” said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Federation.
"Uefa will keep an eye on us all the time."
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Federation PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
“We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparations for the 2012 European Championships will not suffer.”
Several first leaguers had been convicted last season alone for manipulative forced dismissal, after all, even the league start had to be postponed in the short term.
Dennis Quaid is back.
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about Privates - and now has trouble with ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan revealed to her fiancé Dennis Quaid as a fiancee.
He froze - and beats back.
Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unsightly fight with each other - in public.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Meg Ryan first commented on the reasons for the failure of the marriage: “Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful.”
The extent of the fraud has only been experienced after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a marriage break is told.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband clearly fell out: “Unbelievable” it is, the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News that “Meg repeatedly re-examines and seals the history of our relationship.”
It is also "sad" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that mean a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
And so close his invitations with the side lift: "My life goes on anyway.
I’m happy that I have a wonderful family that’s doing well.”
Prices of air tickets and hotels go down
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights have been up to 50 percent cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again – this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a significant decline in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, overnight stays have already been arranged in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, prices were 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend was in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year ago.
As a result, American Express sees the weak dollar rate, which has led to a “decreasing travel appetite for American tourists.”
Financial venues such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices have even kept the record in Europe with a 26.3 percent increase.
Even in the case of air prices, the trend in the first quarter still showed upwards:
Because of the kerosene inertia, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights even became up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy-class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first-class, price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices were even higher than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, falling by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
According to the study, on German domestic flights, the prices have even halved.
On the one hand, the reason for the price collapse is the declining economic growth, the company explains.
Demand has broken down in many segments of the aviation market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, puts increased competitive pressure.
A sign of the tense situation is the elimination of non-profitable routes with airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - these were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes a table leader.
At the Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a functioning elf.
By Kristoffer Klein expands the break-down for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher only came into the game late and failed with a lever to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she went over his lips convincingly.
He simply knew that he was right.
“We need the second gate,” Hermann Rieger said in the cabin entrance to the Hamburg Arena.
Not much was going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most were back in their seats.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist at HSV for nearly three decades, and enjoys a higher reputation than some of the actors who have been cast.
And so his request also found a hearing in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg’s head coach Martin Jol.
His command will have sounded similar: Here with gate two!
The implementation remained.
“It wasn’t all nice to see today,” Marcell Jansen later added.
Bastian Reinhardt, too, would have wanted it "relaxed".
The 1:0 (1:0) were due to Mladen Petric's header (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which designated their club as a class primus.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to arrange that,” said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular interim testimony stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
Although the team with its late-committed accesses - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the Jansen, who were sent off by FC Bayern - is slow to shine, they are not yet able to shine.
“We need more flair and more dribbling,” Jol demanded.
After the defeat of the vote
There is fear on Wall Street.
First news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to temporarily break down by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss in a single day in its history.
Later, the Dow caught something again.
By 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer recorded a good five percent minus 10,579 counters.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down more than seven percent at 1548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
No title could be added.
Goldman Sachs’s shares fell by almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the company.
Under the bailout plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called false mortgages.
However, the sum should be paid out not on one stroke, but step by step.
In return, the State should receive stock option tickets from financial companies that could be redeemed in the event of a corresponding exchange rate development in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
Stock exchange rates in Europe and USA in the downturn
Billions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not solve investors’ doubts.
The stock price of the German big bank Hypo Real Estate drops and rips the dax down.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is losing despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular rate losses of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank have deeply undermined the German stock index (Dax).
The Munich real estate financier’s stock temporarily lost three-quarters of its value despite the federal government and private banks bailout, the Commerzbank declined by more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6000-point mark and recorded a decrease of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
The stock markets around the world have gone downhill.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion bailout could not be enough to reinvigorate the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first trading hour or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially declined by 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei lead index fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index dropped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 counters.
In the MDax, shares of Arcandor declined after the announcement of a capital increase.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed the 23 million new shares.
The trading and tourism group also announced that the shares of Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark Matter Affects Flight from Space probes
For years now, a mysterious phenomenon has been taking care of research for inconsistency: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity might not be quite right.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
Due to the soon-to-be-freezing fuel lines, it is now threatened by the cold death.
Among scientists, for years, a mysterious phenomenon of confusion - the swing-by anomaly - has been taking care of.
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as Earth.
As a result, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the sun probe Ulysses.
What the researchers have been amazed at for years now, however, is that the bodies do not behave 100 percent as expected under the age-old gravitation law.
Rather, there are irregularities in the speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, scientists have not been able to explain this effect.
They named him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attractiveness of matter through a curvature of space, might not be quite right.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by anomalies using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have formed in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space scientists for about ten years.
It is obviously a force of attraction, whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists’ calculations, dark matter makes up about one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists smuggled into Egypt are expected to be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The Sudanese hijackers had demanded several million euros in ransom.
Six hostage-takers were reportedly killed in a shooting prior to the release.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Solvency negotiations are already underway.
Once again, the Germans came to the fore of the kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists stranded in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arabic TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports of the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are currently checking their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are safe and sound, the Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shootout before the hostages were released remains unclear: According to an Egyptian security official, the hijackers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed six of the hijackers by surprise.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom,” the official said.
It was "just about to receive the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot and arrested six of the hijackers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostage takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily El Masri El Jom reported calling for a German mediator to delay the release of the hostages because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of stepfather "led to suicide"
Years of abuse by her stepfather has led to a woman killing herself, a court has been reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after suffering eight cases of sexual abuse.
The court in Truro learned that he regularly imprisoned his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found that Mrs. Randle died at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her up and tied her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who worked for the National Trust on a large part of her time on a voluntary basis, was being prosecuted for the abuse that had been committed to her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been a keen surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "gave up her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by choking herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended up saying, "I used to bind her and connect her eyes."
“I didn’t need them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "She's an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been scary for her victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unhappy story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still, the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would have ended in court had she not done so.”
He added: "I am aware of the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, her actions over the years had on her daughter.
Otherwise, she would have clearly been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Act."
The man was assigned to the Department of Defense when he lost two highly confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the weakest accusation within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said: "They would have thought that this would have dealt with the Department of Defense and the Cabinet internally."
The employee, whose name cannot be mentioned, is charged under paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Public Prosecutor’s Office recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he submitted contained classified assessments of Al-Quaida and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies see B&B costs in the eye
British housing companies could stand in the house after rescuing Bradford and Bingley Bank costs of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million.
The government provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect Bradford & Bingley’s 2.6 million customers.
Interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), said it was "unacceptable" that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid if Bradford & Bingley’s loans are repaid.
But the interest accrued in the meantime is billed every year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The programme for the compensation of financial services confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now called upon to take on some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest rate on the loan will be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies need to raise <0xC2><0xA3>81 million for the first year’s interest rates.
Adrian Coles, the director general of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved cautiously during the real estate boom will now be called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the records were made in 1945.
“We will be looking at all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs.”
Interest, due in 2009, covers the seven months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are both-sided organizations without partners, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per liter more expensive
People in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations of a consulting firm were conducted.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Prior to the price increase in February, Jersey Milk’s wholesale price last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail plea from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court had refused bail in connection with the charge of extorting 50 million Taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina’s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released earlier this month against bail.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government should first grant her unrestricted freedom.
Correspondents say that although her weekly suspension was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of her release whether she will be able to continue on foot when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers state that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court’s decision.
“The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina’s bail plea because it says she doesn’t have to be granted bail because she is already on week leave abroad to be treated abroad,” said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a legal complaint against the Supreme Court."
Their lawyers insist that they need bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after October 17, an Awami alliance party chairman said on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against each other.
Concerns about the anti-police initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest anti-police initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban’s pledge not to attack or hinder the thousands of vaccination workers.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its case against the Competition Commission’s decision to reduce its share of the competing ITV channel.
The Competition Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyB’s share distorted the competition and allowed it to have a more unsound influence on the ITV channel.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully blocking the purchase of ITV by NTL, now renamed Virgin Media.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB had raised doubts about the independence of ITV, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation into the purchase of the share of ITV.
Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom’s communications office have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that reducing the pressure on ITV was an unreasonable and excessive measure, particularly because BskyB had announced that it wanted to give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. Attorney General's Affair
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special counsel to deal with the dismissal of the nine U.S. Attorneys General in 2006.
The event was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticized.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, lawmakers and the former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special Investigator Nora Dannehy is now set to find out if the officers interrogated during the investigation have lied to the investigators to obstruct the justice system.
Serious allegations including criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or clarified, said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the authority to force the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Justice Department removed nine U.S. prosecutors from its offices in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry argued that the state attorneys would be fired because of weak work performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, causing many observers to view the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these state attorneys were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others had refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud by Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are charged with investigating and prosecuting court cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, has been shot for the dismissals and has ultimately resigned his office.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In particular, the Inspector General’s report critically addressed Gonzales’ role by bearing the “main responsibility” for the dismissals, “giving up” his leadership role and showing “extraordinarily disinterested” in the process.
Other officials, including President Bush’s former chief adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the Q Award for its epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will take his special gold award next week in London during the ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's award after coming into the narrower selection in four categories.
Editor-in-Chief of Q Magazine Paul Rees said there would be some songs that go beyond such subjects as time and genre, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song that was written by Jim Steinman required a powerful voice that was delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and peaked at number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years on the charts and has sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, one of which was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeats after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to an acute concussion.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon for sale
New York City has thousands of main roads, alleys, side streets and other surrounding streets, some of which are famous and others are just comfortable.
Nevertheless, it is difficult even for experienced taxi drivers and long-time locals to say where Extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty street than an actively used driveway.
There are also no road signs.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to repaint Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short street, simply because it is one of the remnants of the house block’s past.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in receiving them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the City Administration and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district manager in the municipal council 3.
“Very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city,” she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago that it will be setting up new small streets and seats designed for a cafe, among other things, to which the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was first made public during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said the company wanted to use the road, but did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decayed street and make it a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Department of Building Protection, said it was actually the city’s desire to sell the street and stressed that the department’s task was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood of The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802 when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was split between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was claimed by none.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who took the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of debris, lumps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called “Jeremiah’s Disappearing New York” (subtitled “The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the Extinction City”), has published part of the conversation of urban history about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine “The New Yorker in 1952.”
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow alley that remains dark even during the day and is marked by rusted metal doors of warehouses, closed windows and week-old newspapers flying past raindrops."
With a few exceptions, the street just looked like this recently on an evening.
A rat ran through the back of the road, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti were on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of out-of-stock newspapers.
Some passers-by said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be paved a bit.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the road in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, wet and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: Education in an English-speaking environment
In this edition of the "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, Senior Research Fellow in California Studies and Senior Director in Educational Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs a School Choice".
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign mentions that “the probability of African-American and Hispanic students successfully completing school is lower than that of white students” – which is true.
To close this gap in performance, Obama’s education plan recommends, among other things, a bilingual transition phase in education for those who first learn English.
Yet the question to Obama is whether his use of bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Let’s take for example “Sixth Street Prep,” a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of the students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently been in the country, are learning English.
Yet, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of fourth-grade students passed the state exam in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the children from the fourth year of school were rated as well in the English exam.
This amazing success was achieved with methods other than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on review and practice, on constant control of knowledge, and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
In addition, the school is practicing the approach by which the training takes place in an English-speaking environment, which is exactly the point that Obama should pay attention to, says Linda Mikels, the head of the school.
This approach places value on the almost exclusive use of the English language in professional training.
Mrs. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later, you would enter the classroom and not be able to recognize him again.
“It works,” she remarked, “it works for us.”
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other English-speaking students?
The school’s performance would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within its own party (the national educational associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama’s answer uncertain.
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about legislation aimed at "only English".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Obama actually wants to close the power gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices fall due to renewed fears about the economy
The oil price fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets might not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude oil trading on the New York Stock Exchange fell 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by both the financial turmoil on Wall Street and by strong swirling storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to nearly $90 per barrel this month, then again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were already again concerned, although congressional representatives had announced that they had agreed on a bailout plan on the weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This message was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the first last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, Citigroup is expected to buy up Wachovia Corporation’s banking business.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it did not seem to be able to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a statement to investors that the forecasts for the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe they will continue to write that the commodity markets will also be affected.
“From the perspective of the commodity markets, we are most concerned about whether the U.S. virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China.”
Bank analysts have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the coming year downwards, and their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 have fallen by 20%.
Team record set by series in the second quarter
Internal defender Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all after staying in the Jets jersey more often than anyone else in the last eight and a half years.
Then, on Sunday, he saw the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a fruitless game into a triumphal draw.
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Ellis said.
After a muddy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect start to an afternoon when her developing collaboration made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, one time as an outside defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of halftime.
“I didn’t put much effort into it,” Coles says of the passes that went to Coles.
“He is a super player.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense quarterback Kurt Warner took apart.
External defender Darrelle Revis caught an unlucky throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then suffered a loss to Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had conquered the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets regained the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20-yard shot into a 34-0 lead.
These were the most points the jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the Jets' coach, answered, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answers both, because the Jets allowed the third quarter to score 21 points without a single, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were achieved in a short period of time."
Ausgerueder Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some consider him to be the best long-distance runner of all time, after breaking his own record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to have made the distance of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous score from 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he reached last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has set his 26th world record in his versatile career in which he has achieved at least one World Championship title or set a world record on every track from a kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie dropped out of the Beijing Olympic Marathon, out of fear that in retrospect it may have been exaggerated that air pollution could worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish line - Gebrselassie has won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since trackrunners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have switched to long-distance runs, the record time for marathons in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with a score of 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his waist two weeks ago and was therefore unable to train for a week.
Apparently, he was refreshed after a break and did not come back rusty.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed training a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great."
He has been criticized for over-orchestrating his races, many of the world’s best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders, as if it were a track race, and setting world records about the race.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of the breweries as long-distance runners.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the centre of the route in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite racers, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers left.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last appearance to break away from Kwambai, who came second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a considerable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing due to problems described as a back injury, however, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She planned her run skillfully by letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners tear out first, but overtaking it after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya came third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the sufferings in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the growths of the amusement parks around Orlando, a few miles away from the glittering, loud and gigantic drive, lies a quiet city in which the pride and complications of African American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first completely black town in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquettes, 300 brown hides, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no grass."
Today it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that describes it – and which made it a tourist destination – is, and remains, a place of a very special kind in many respects by taking it to the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers’ Project at the time of the depression.
Eatonville is as independent, generous and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who “knows so little about us that he doesn’t know what’s going on with him.”
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open conversation about race relations, many are still suffering from being watched by outsiders.
“We are very concerned about how our history is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a member of the congregation of the city’s oldest church.
It must be true."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the sometimes condemned, sometimes praised, black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on the hat.
And so right, the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in oral form, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Florida travel guide changed the city, located very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the shacks of black history and human drama.
Frech and Oskar both in real life and in literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
“Beyond the street to the left,” she wrote, “is the brown-whitely-striped modern school, with its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, even though he can barely read and write.”
She also mentioned the new man of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and what-and-always fits into classrooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
“Zora described things as they were,” said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by citing the men who sang songs about her beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added: "Some people didn't like it."
One still remembers Hurtson here as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came to town in need, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that even today imagines something about her venerable style of clothing.
According to Mr. Franklin, most residents were fascinated, while many despised them.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Mr Franklin said.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he swinged in his chair, on a rear facing terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, in which Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were lost.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was placed in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there were no great memorials, no public readings in great style.
“I don’t think they understood their contribution to the world or their heritage at all,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the community.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed the highway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
“At this time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the people sitting away,” Mr. Franklin said.
“There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s demand to force integration by calling its decision in Brown’s case against the school board “as insulting as respecting my race.”
Residents today say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some ways, it weakened the group’s cohesion in Eatonville and the self-awareness of its youth.
"Black children were used to being embraced - I remember - one embraced his teacher in the morning and one embraced his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group for the protection of the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't hug his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide," Ms. Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have contributed to the creation of space for more Zora Neale Hurstons – black authors, actors, and artists who turned away from prejudices, as they did, with positive self-awareness and statements like: "How can anyone be free to guess?
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker set out on her way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her glory.
Five years later, a much-praised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshelves, and again made it part of the American literary canon.
The long-distance project came at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the public light.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a rescuer.
The community began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-lane highway revived the city, accelerated the whole thing at top speed, aroused real civic pride," Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the long-distance project has contributed to a change in the city’s self-image.
There were more and more train trips, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was included in the country-wide historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a special place in Florida: only 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a backstreet in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black today.)
Outsiders looking for the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, permission is required in advance and certain things - such as the mural of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men in field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that her shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival grew larger, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw its entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and diligent, barking and mixing like any other race and people group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after college to Eatonville to work in the city administration or at the police station, which he says might need some help with.
And even the youngsters, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just walk through here will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'" Alondra Kenon said recently on a Sunday after the church.
“But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York we speak fluently financial Latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from the newspapers and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t even notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, have the worst day of horror work every day since the stock market crash of 1929.
The suppliers still use loud clappers to push the metal tea carts along the sidewalks and transport tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still sniffed between apartments as human pack animals loaded with the 50-pound t-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod lying on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for food stalls on their breakfast bagel on the sidewalks and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 pm and 7 pm.
It didn’t feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon due to all the world’s downturn.
Although I had decided to put my passage on time on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase family branch, there were already about 20 people.
Not at the cash desks to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists on the way to Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most of the time, I learned later from Starr, my "personal banker with a license", for the same reason I was a snake.
Unlike me, however, they had already lifted their savings from smaller banks, in places where they commuted from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called “thrifts” (a little like a building savings fund), cooperative banks, and those local savings banks that only have branches in a state and say they treat their customers like family.
In the last year, 15 of these banks have gone silent and silent.
Over the past few days, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion bank, went into bankruptcy management over and as last Friday New Yorkers drove home over the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank that owns savings facilities worth $440 billion, in search of a saver.
Fearing another crash, the office and shop staff who were standing in front of me brought their bar to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Quite normal New Yorkers have acquired flowing financial lattes in recent weeks.
A woman who telephoned in my Chinese domestic supermarket was so familiar with Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and their slurred-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if she was babbling about a phony colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my block of residence has come down from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
“I now have all my savings in money market funds,” she told me after visiting the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any more risks."
Muslim graves damaged during right-wing raid in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, in order to organize "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, dotted with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of the funeral at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at the extreme right-wing parties, recording significant gains in the country’s parliamentary election.
On Friday night, more than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the cemetery in Traun near Linz in an organized action, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this an attempt to conceal the motive of the extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear if the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" about the news of the funeral that took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan draws to an end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is underway in Austria, after the country slipped to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary election.
The FP<0xC3><0x96> and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, which both far-right parties received almost 30% of the vote, advocated for a strict anti-immigrant law in their election campaign, and some of their electoral slogans were criticized by opponents as foreign enemies.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FP<0xC3><0x96>, who won 18% of the vote, advocated a ban on napkins and burkas and even expressed his dislike of food, which is generally associated with Islam.
In his last sermon in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which state that the extreme rights are the most politically powerful bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent were granted last Thursday to impose a foreign travel ban after they provided the judges with evidence of Glitter’s pretrial detention for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford County Court in Kent, but was represented by the Corker Binning law firm.
A spokesman for the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, September 25, Kent Police applied to the Ashford District Court for permission to prevent foreign travel from Mr Paul Glad to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
According to the Register of Sexual Offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of 5 years.
Police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter’s possible whereabouts in the country.
A Kent Police Department spokeswoman said: "The police in Kent will do everything they can to protect children in this country and abroad."
“In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks.”
"It is the highest concern of the Kent police to protect the Kent residents and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of registered sexual offenders in the country to minimize any risk that could be posed to the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he did not feel comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport control and he flew after a while to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to the UK.
Finally, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge County Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been incarcerated in the UK for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Interior Ministry, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was reassured and pleased that Glitter had been prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
‘I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character’, G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who give up concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into these moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find the gesture typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands that are worried because they will not enter the stage.
In his project <0x60>Flamenco-people', the German photographer G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Bauer presents alternating theatrical performances on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flame code representation at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the month of photography of Flamenco, ‘reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is becoming ever greater from day to day,’ explains the artist and makes it clear that <0x60>Flamenco-people' are ‘any kind of person who can’t be bothered by the pictures, but if you like the pictures, don’t like them.
Quite normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience on stage.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you do not have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character are in her heart.
What interested me was creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera."
Bauer, inspired by the <0x60>Cante de las Minas' festival, embarked on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the camera’s image sorting function and the existing material, images were created that remind of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, which gives the image the modernity and the idea, as the farmer Flamenco understands: ‘Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day’.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata in the near future.
Famous personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the close selection of nearly seventy artists who were photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as a ‘portrait of the veterans of sport’ (‘SportARTproject’).
Although the concepts of the <0x60>Flamenco-people' project are different, the photographer likes to photograph people, get to know them and put me in their state of life, whether it’s for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography, the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or bump into people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of portraits of the Flamenco of today entitled <0x60>Flamenco-people' is on display in the gallery of El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata, located on the street called la calle de la Mata and parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he’s just writing is “a genius.”
He does not yet know where the novel’s plot is taking place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is persistently trying to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland, who lived in the Congo for twenty years and so in the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the favorite Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project he is working on is ‘a genius’ and ‘everything points out that he shouldn’t write the novel’.
‘If I had to, I wouldn’t have done it, but I’m going to do it and hope to finish the novel someday,’ he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within four days he had seen hundreds of writers, historians, journalists.
The author of <0x60>La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival’s premium and voiced most attendees, is compared to the old edition of ‘Our Mutual Friend’ and can be seen at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in front of him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who had a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through everything again: how he was called to the literature, was conceived of as 'extraordinary'
The Hispanic American novelist admitted that there is ‘no way’ to measure and how to know whether books change life, ‘but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience’ and ‘I’m not asking’ for answers,’ but ‘I’m telling you that’
During the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: bullfighting festivals were partly falling out.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, with which the festival was to be concluded in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, with the agreement of Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the organizer has decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the festival of the unstable weather was postponed, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, which is why the second planned bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>as and Juan Bautista, who entered the bullfighting arena gradually.
There was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, a large part of the audience reacted in his second fight with Buh-Rufen.
In <0xC3><0x81>lava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>on (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Two police officers called on the drivers of the car to stop, after which they seized the escape.
It looked like they wouldn’t have to stop loading more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police pursued them and arrested one of the drivers, the 28-year-old man known as A.A.J., as reported by the Basque State Interior Ministry.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police officers of the <0xC3><0x81>lava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the town of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>on.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police began the chase until the car stopped after a few kilometers on the edge of the strip, at which point the drivers got out of the car to escape across a country road into a forested area.
In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with Hashish bundles, which were later led to accurate laboratory analysis and to the suspension of the bundle at other police stations.
In addition, the officials found that the mark was <0x60>double', so it did not match the mark indicated in the car papers, which is why in addition an arrest was made for counterfeiting official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigations to carry out the arrest of the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, could escape, but also to determine the origin of the drugs seized.
The arrested 28-year-old A.A.J. was taken to a police station for questioning and will be presented to the prison judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug dealer.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of an unknown drug dealer.
A witness watched as she tried to get out of her parking hole in Montecito in a rather strange way, a spokesman for the California traffic police told People magazine.
The witness told in detail that Locklear pushed through the gas pedal after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking gap, and as she drove backwards, she caught a few times on her sunglasses.
A little later, the witness, who at first probably did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby street and leaving the car.
The witness was the person who alerted the emergency service because she had ‘fear of living around Locklears’.
When the police came, they found the actress sitting in her car, standing across the street, blocking traffic.
‘They seemed to be clueless’, which is why they brought the police to a special drug and alcohol center to take a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress proved cooperative, excessive alcohol enjoyment was ruled out from the very first moment. <0x60>The first observations of the officials as a result, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug addict', the spokesperson said.
Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving under the influence of an indeterminate substance that could not be determined and was placed in a local investigation custody at around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was discharged from the Arizona clinic after treatment, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian League of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the chief coordinator of the VL and MPs of the United Left, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sports of the Town Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, to meet with the family who was retired after last week
“In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one that has to assume the responsibility for this,” Llamazares pointed out, pointing out the party’s approach to the one that sits as a city councilor in the municipal council of Seville until now.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the need for <0x60>transparency' in the possible investigations of the rule violations that Silva might have started: <0x60>The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has 'a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
<0x60>Sangre de mayo': Hero Book by Garci
Inspired by <0x60>Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Carci in <0x60>Sangre de Mayo' represents the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros invested for the screenplay.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to present <0x60>a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the beginning of a long list of books.
<0x60>Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and later shown on the TV channel Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a big fan of the literature of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, assures that thanks to this filming his <0x60>childhood dream' went into fulfillment. This he thanked Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the autonomous community of Madrid, a memorial film to the second century celebration of Madrid.
The total contribution of 15 million, made by the autonomous community of Madrid for filming, offers Garci, as he added, the 'unique opportunity' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the image of 'confused Spain', which chose the wrong leader for the fight, because the people were oppressed by the struggle for independence.
However, the filmmaker regrets that it was not possible to count on funding as with <0x60>Alatriste' or <0x60>Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as with <0x60>Sangre de Mayo'), so some scenes from the screenplay with Horacio Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel, with whom Garci could not work, were almost all his career.
For this reason, Garci, who was also a film director in <0x60>Volver a Empezar', worked through his usual way of working: he set himself up on the stage to the actors with whom one must first try before one starts to shoot and work in the film, and he worked for those who had not made a casting in the <0x60>Kiependi', he appeared
Many actors he encounters in <0x60>Sangre de Mayo' have to repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, an Oscar nominee in four nominations (one of which he has won), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither <0x60>Sangre film de mayo', nor <0x60>Siete mesas de billar francés'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
‘At first you think you’re working for the offspring, later you realize it’s just for success, and now you’re happy when you’ve made another movie,’ Garci explains after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n recalls the memory of the dancer from Sevilla T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville adores a dancer who also came from Seville.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia: her father was Catalane (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first female emancipation campaigners, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian, and advocated the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me this role, which seemed impossible to me.”
“We’re not trying to talk about her life, but to keep her spirit,” said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance basics helped me a lot in Flamenco.
For example, <0x60>Dance of the Butterfly' came to me like Guajira, or <0x60>Dance of the Snake' like Tango.
Her dance was meaningful and I’ve been told that my dance is also in this aesthetic area,” she says.
The script features two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will once again sing for Isabel in one of her performances, as he did in <0x60>La puerta abierta'; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work with one of her ex-students exceptionally.
<0x60>Matilde plays T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola, a very mature personality.
I’m happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.”
The performance also includes musical composition and guitarists Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; with the percussion of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra J<0xC3><0xBA>arez, he <0xCC><0x81>ve always been in the role of the companion.
In this work one also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who was known in such far-off places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to call her back in remembrance because I think she is one of the women who has a huge influence on a certain era and whose works today no one knows anymore and therefore appreciates her even less,” Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n says.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theater.
The publication of the book <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at a place where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married in 1916 Zenobia, offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture (the <0x60>Triennium of the Juveniles').
Thus, the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n' is concluded with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez-Zenobia and with the walking exhibition <0x60>Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez' has now been in the exhibition <0x60>Aquel chopo de luz'
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado' published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet better known.
The U.S. Can Imagine Badly Without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.
This line comes from actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him in 'Sensation Reporter', and from the then-dominant performance of American cinema, which was left in the limelight, from all of America to Newman with his enthusiastic performance and following her.
Look at how much it cost her to give him the Oscar.
When he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big hit for everyone.
“What one feels at times is substantially more than an expression, and now I’ve lost a great friend,” said Robert Redford crying, “my life and my country were the greatest atrocities of his life.”
No one was afraid to laugh or exaggerate.
As the father of cinema and country, he died in a sad moment, in which fear of terrorists and the collapse of the market, in which the downtrodden sense of self-worth of Americans is in the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue few people can admire, one does not necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied almost a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as well as various losses and gains: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from his first marriage, which died of overdose, was founded up to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country, where it took a lot of effort to enforce itself against a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of surprise strikes high above Hollywood, regardless of nationality and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person has died, but the entire era.
Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said the work with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
'The greatest of us all left,' said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who dare to live as Paul Newman lived today: to receive high demands for justice, to lead a responsible private life far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He got divorced once and was then married to Joanne Woodward fifty years later, who he was faithful to, although there certainly were many opportunities not to be.
‘Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?’ he often joked himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, he was not as proud of anyone as he was of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and the philanthropist,' they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are lacking.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after failing for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask myself, ‘Are we prepared for this?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it is not true!
It was called the perfect road, and according to my assessment, it was the worst road with everything there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you would consider the rating and I could check it, something clearly would not have passed.
But, let’s go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticketing that allows you to go first.
It doesn’t seem to be bad either, but if they let you go, then they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the traffic jam).
I don't think so.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that is in it, just to go there) and (after an endless queue) there is the surprise! The t-shirt was only in size <0x60>S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
So good, things like this are a small thing compared to the days on the road.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting queue of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as was expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front, even if it had once succeeded, but it would have been harder to get them back.
In addition, it seemed to wait 40 minutes after rain, so there was an attempt to organize a popular uprising and attack the houses.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia and some like me will not even appear on the classification due to this chip I got, I can already think that the output was missampled.
Of course, if I were asked about a perfect road, this road would never impress me.
So I think we will dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games for a long time.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the <0x60>Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but capable of performing some primitive system tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, planning to do so), which is a routine.
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, this ‘receptionist’ can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also assign the attendees to the groups after the talks.
In the presentation video, <0x60>the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that that person is not affiliated with the group that leads her conversation, and that she is also not a company employee.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will be listening soon.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things it can focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked very superficially about Microsoft’s strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have as many built-in programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will be only for the few.
Everything is only a statement when you consider that Microsoft added one function and <0x60>Extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worth it
Microsoft is right, the operating system gradually loses meaning, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, it was part of the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
A lot of people pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can work at the same time.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its ‘death’, not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system each time, more so to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run Firefox, Explorer, or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than around the ‘windows’.
What is the use of half of existing applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Easier, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need this, without a doubt. I will give a small example of this.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the refreshment drink machine: <0x60>Your search. Our future'. It prints out a request to use your own tool for online searches.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google, used the Internet for research.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso made it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in <0x60>Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in <0x60>Der Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it belongs to the clothing of a well-built parish priest.
When we begin to list the countless star appearances, we can go back to the image of a very powerful man, with a pointed beard who had lifted weights in a hiking district.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, exceeds all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called <0x60>Marcel' in the narrow circle. The legend tells that the creation of the name is associated with sport and came from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
<0x60>La Marcel' excels everyone because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cuts and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (nearly recognizable) that these T-shirts have as detail on the neckline.
And attention, the Belgian company focuses not only on the production of <0x60>tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Cashmere, Cotton Trousers, T-Shirts with Stripes, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
However, it is very bad to use them as underwear.
They are very attractive.
‘I want to be a young mother; I don’t care about the candidate’
Her large appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz is cute, but full of life joy.
The Gruz brothers are currently taking their new business in fashion very seriously.
For M<0xC3><0xB3>nica, this means significantly more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris during the promotion of the company Mango, where she moved her residence and also made the presentation of the most important prizes in fashion, sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Compassionate and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango, and I have also attended the presentation of the second edition of <0x60>Mango Fashion Awards' and participated in the dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intensive working time that is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister and I are both fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to go through a city and watch women get dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do that often.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think yes, but in the end, everything meets in one and these areas have a lot in common.
Ever since I was a little girl, I’ve been fascinated by clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother’s to wrap around my aunt’s wardrobe and see her clothes.
This was great, almost better than going to a theme park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and at the rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you move into the real acting role.
After all, everything is connected to each other, it is so, a lot of respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You've recently turned 30, haven't you fallen into a crisis?
Oh, it was.
I feel better than ever when I’m 30 years old.
I think the woman gets mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid because of my biological clock.
I wanted to do the things I’ve done since I was little and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
I have known for a long time that I will become a mother because that requires my body and I also want to be a young mother; I don’t want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not worried.
I will convey great happiness to my child and educate him with a lot of love.
As far as the art of film is concerned, keep in mind the works you participated in and were filmed last year.
This is exactly what it is and I would like to see it presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course can not be immediately.
I very much hope that <0x60>La <0xC3><0xBA>timo hora' and <0x60>En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be shown for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A few days ago, you showed up on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
If it's okay, say something.
It’s not like I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, has simply called me and invited me to London to attend a parade for the charity event of her organization <0x60>Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show. I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection for Ngo were sold for Ngo.
The people do not know Naomi’s good heart.
I, as the one who knows her, would tell you that they don't vote.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this big hearted thing, but when she comes and asks me to do a handstand, I’ll do it too.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
The drivers, who can be resuscitated because of the alcohol level, will have to install the <0x60>alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for the alcohol level, install in his car this system, which prohibits him from starting the car in the drunk state. If he is alcoholic, then the car does not jump on.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General's Office, according to them it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is the resocialization of the driver, which is why he gets a course for retraining traffic behaviour.
In addition to the Attorney General’s Office, according to experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automobile Safety will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who were shown more than once because of driving under the influence of alcohol were back in control.
The <0x60>alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the ventilated air and prevents the car from starting when the driver has taken the alcohol test; or when an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices already prevent up to 65% of rule violations in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to attack this behavior before it becomes a crime.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legislative reform can be implemented in the usual way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still not available on the Spanish markets, in any store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Calculated tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without ‘peep-toes’
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., at the time provided by the program, next to the presidential hangar of the Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez de México DF airport, the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force landed with the Prince and Princess of Asturias travelling.
The sun went down, but their rays still forced to use their hand as a sunshade to see the royal couple exiting the plane.
Directly at Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so you can't take people to the airport at this time you're from here or so
No, she's the Spaniard, but she's lived here a couple of years.
- Oh, that's right, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are many waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including the military protection of 27 Marines, who pay tribute.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair veiled by the wind, without ordinary ‘peep-toes’, may have been told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before they enter the room, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official order is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for them, who likes to make jokes.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly excellent fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition <0x60>el B<0xC3><0xB3>ton-Mango Fashion Awards' to promote and increase young fashion talents internationally.
This is awarded with a cash prize of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the shop window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost wept because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company's second largest business in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest business is located in London.
So many events have taken place that are associated with the fact that you would like to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition. It all ended with a luxury dinner at Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by the pain, because his brother died recently, broke down. He put on the suit from the fashion house and put on some jewelry from ELAH, which were breathtaking. He stayed on the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and is near the Egle of Valtino.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango house, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so he ended up with the Baron of Rothschild without jackets, because they borrowed the lady's jackets.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz, has rushed to the store and had a pants and a shirt that she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. On a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a room for ballet rehearsals, so she made time to get excited, she got older
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, a personality who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 advice against stress
There is not 1000, but one more way to forget chaotic us fast everyday life.
And even if there are few, they are all collected in a book in which there is how to relax. The book comes into the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse, the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that demands the present life.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one and not two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnecting from the world of work.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga poses, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott in the book represents the entire list of options that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called <0x60>1001 ways to relax' and thus the peace that the book conveys comes into the bookstores of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Those who believe that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as workspace with the help of personal contacts, this handbook refutes such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered, how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
When the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, shut down the brain, and focus on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some children talk at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be scared, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder, which is called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, such as during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is not a single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often, relationships are sought with other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, enuresis noctura (sleeping at night), speech in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be very high fiber, stress situations, or overdemand.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one speaks quietly in individual words, whispers, or it may be quite the opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult with a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes fear and comes about in this way.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnoea or with stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple preventative measures:
Do not try to excite the child before going to sleep.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV shows that are terrible and a little too wild.
In the nervous children, whose relaxations are recommended, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep calmly.
When speaking occurs once in sleep, try to keep the peace.
Keep in mind that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful advices
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Even though the child speaks, he sleeps, so he rests.
Remember, if it turns out to be scary after a few appearances, then it is recommended to consult or find out what reason the child has for fear.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure to perform a reading and get more information.
This way you won’t be able to achieve anything because when the child sleeps, he is unconscious and can’t think about it.
Also, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams about and why it says it, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Perhaps, it does not tell the child that you hear it at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhouses ... finally
After a long stretch of thirst, Illh<0xC3><0xA4>usern is finally back on track for success.
Without much effort, the yellow-blacks played numerous touring chances and managed to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, at which the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the host captain Kauffmann, whose distance shot barely passes at the angle, the ill-houses should easily dominate the game, and it was possible to alternately first funder flick with a distance shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot, to make the mark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and only allowed the lively Riyadh to pass at the top of the storm.
The start of the second half should be decisive with two goal chances first fought by Riahi and Temporal, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the Illh<0xC3><0xA4>user by Marais, who was exactly right to take a ball again, which had been defended in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the ill-fated goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for a long time and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, which forced his teammates to continue playing numerically.
Denmark, however, did not know how to exploit this and did not face any major problems to an ill-fated elf, who only retreated a little to ‘conquer’ their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a great mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another landing in Brittany.
In light of the fishermen’s determined attitude, which blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to meet with their representatives at the Port of Guilvinec in the Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re on Tuesday morning.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit', and hoped that he would come with 'concrete proposals'.
The president’s visit is at the same time as a general meeting of the crisis committee, which was founded by the Breton fishermen to implement measures in view of the extreme rise in diesel prices, which has reached a record value of an average of over 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysee Palace press spokesman David Martinon, “the president will discuss possible solutions with them to help their businesses become competitive again, and to secure the working conditions and the payment of seafarers.”
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning, they led the Morbihan and Calvados marches, which caused a nearly ten-kilometer-long storm.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le did not break.
The Quiberon Peninsula was demarcated with a barrier.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets from the early morning in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishermen did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique in the evening dissolved the blockade of the important total refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday’s meeting in the ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec has to decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee who did not support their movement.
<0x60>The strike will go on' because <0x60>the fishermen will not give up at all' and <0x60>do not want to go to Paris', said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.
Paul Newman, The Wonderful
Butch Cassidy and the Kid died at the age of 83 from cancer at his home in Connecticut.

Embraer keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft to be delivered this year, despite the looming recession, as a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, has confirmed its delivery forecast for 2008 with 215 delivered aircraft, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving away more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times, the American International Group, which has been financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, is considering giving away more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion that has been extended to it.
AIG is ready to drive the sale of a large part of its business, beyond its life insurance at the international level and its retirement provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to review possible sales.
At AIG, no confirmation could be obtained.
Among the assets that AIG might separate from, is its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity.
No final decision has been made regarding these sales, the FT continues.
AIG must make sales as soon as possible in order to repay the loans over $85 billion that the Federal Reserve has granted it, also at the risk that the U.S. authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the session Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange on Monday, after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to save banks, reported a historic fall in rates: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a never-before-seen loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
As far as the points are concerned, the strongest case in its history (684.81 points) was previously recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the trade decline after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
According to the final knockout figures, the Nasdag index, mainly related to technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widespread Index Standard&Poors 500 by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks by the House of Representatives, which was supposed to allow some stability in the markets again, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 against, MPs denied the funds he had requested from Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“This is where a bad picture is put in circulation, which makes Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
‘This shows how much the market was on this plan,’ she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will be ‘too late’.
“If the project is indeed doomed to failure, it will quickly be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank) and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would further limit credit conditions,” warned Brian Bethune, chief economic officer at Global In.
And Miss Piegza emphasized, highlighting the feeling of extreme urgency even more, “that every day that spreads, the ruin of a financial company” in the United States “brings with it.”
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the U.S. authorities planned to buy Wachovia's banking business from its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are “not only facing an American but a global crisis,” the FTN analyst added.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The income from the state treasury within ten years went down from 3.632% on Friday night to 3.827%, and the income within 30 years of last night from 4.161 to 4.357%.
Obama, winner after points in first TV duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday followed another to find out who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in the election of both Republicans and Democrats in this television duel, which was to be followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain’s performance, although quite apparent, was not ‘brilliant’ enough to allow him to stop his decline in election issues five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which released a poll on Saturday, which according to Obama is five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the Democrat clearly makes the better figure.
In the still undecided voters, i.e. those who are now on the ballot, Obama emerged as the winner of the polls with 39%, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected of his rival Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She's got good instincts, but Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not cease to put his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy at the forefront, and at the same time quite clearly underscore his opponent’s ‘naiveness’ with regard to these issues, which formed the centerpiece of this first television duel.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...," he said several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president,” he said.
An attack point that has been preached in the Republican polling stations since yesterday.
Obama himself emphasized that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and accurately, without getting out of the version.
He put his ability at the forefront of making good decisions and renewing the image that the world has of the United States.
“McCain still hasn’t understood, Obama has already,” a Democratic campaigner who was accused of failing to capture the full extent of the crisis on the American off the street said this weekend.
“During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in a statement yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election event in North Carolina in torrential rain.
He didn’t even mention the words ‘middle class’ or ‘workers’. ‘The financial crisis gives Obama, whom the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy even at the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
“Next week could be a crucial turning point,” said the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For Democratic candidates, the current crisis is the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain.
After again stressing that he would probably even manage to lower taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations in Wall Street, the Illinois Senator pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, along with the introduction of a primordial system, would be beneficial to the creation of a renewable energy system.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates cautiously evade the questions raised by Congress last night and are extremely unpopular with the people on the plan to save the financial market over $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion).
<0x60>Have you noticed that there was an election in Minsk?'
On Sunday evening, youth and opposition protesters demonstrated in the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred white Russians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the polling stations on the Minsk market square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, numerous youths had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukashenko: ‘The dictator should resign’.
Some admit that they didn’t even choose: ‘What good is it if they do what they want with my voice,’ says one young woman.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself to foreign observers in the best light in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including non-participation of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the seizure of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
"We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the countdown," said Juri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous coalition of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us that is the executive.
If members of the opposition are to go into parliament, then because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcast time on television, meetings in the regions, and legislative proposals."
The opposition is therefore obliged to intervene in the political game, because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters a crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has pursued the electoral process, does not recognise the election as valid.
She stresses that the voter turnout figures appear too high, and that the extension of voting in advance (26% of Minsk voters) paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
‘Have you noticed that an election has taken place?’ asks Social Democrat leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners to be released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, namely those who most closely correspond to the ideas of the government."
The silence of the night falls again over the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Controversy - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained the public’s trust, which had been severely shaken by the blood-sucking scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Donor Service during the 1980s were contaminated with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus.
In the face of this drama and public dissatisfaction, in February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever aimed at bringing light into the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and drafting guidelines to reverse this kind of catastrophism.
While Judge Krever still hesitated to submit his report, several provinces at the time set up a committee whose goal was to develop a new system for managing blood cans in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
According to reports by Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
“In 1998, when Hema-Quebec took up its work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec,” Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
By the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood cans and by working in this area over the following years, we have regained public confidence," she says, before proudly stressing that by the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that ‘trust is something extremely fragile’.
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting on the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of cattle madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, tells this woman, who has been in charge since the foundation in 1998.
“And we didn’t have the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So let us refer to one of the main guidelines of the reports of Cancer and Gélineau, which according to which one applies exclusion measures, if one does not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is caused by a degeneration of the brain.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without a doubt, this disease was proven to be transmitted via blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied makes sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NSTs) that allow it to prove directly in the blood of the donor the presence of the virus itself, and not that of the antibody against the virus, as was the case with the previously used tests.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation time that takes place between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize this, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
In other words, it means that you have to distribute 12 million blood cans before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cans each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case in which HIV was transmitted via a blood cannery occurs.
I think you can feel comfortable with it these days if you get or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore health," says Hema-Quebec's CEO.
'Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can enter the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted through the blood by insects.
“We need to monitor continuously,” Dr. Décary continues, before stressing that Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supplies in addition to a safe supply.
<0x60>The demand is increasing because the population is ageing.
Because cancer-fighting treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, of which on average only 3% belong to the population of Quebec suitable for blood donation.
Any healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because, for example, they have AIDS or malaria, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is widespread are excluded from blood donation for one year.
With this 3%, we are able to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It’s hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep them and make them become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec not only supplies blood cans, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which are used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being temporarily stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec’s only public umbilical cord blood bank.
In the umbilical cord, which was previously considered biomedical waste, there is abundant blood on stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
<0x60>A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to take more than a thousand a year.
‘We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year,’ explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of umbilical cord blood removal as very popular.
“Many mothers are convinced they don’t have access to it because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-final
Montreal’s Impact made its debut yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders in the second and decided to play the quarter-finals at the Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal ratio counted, for the semi-final round of the USL qualifiers of the first Li.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive goal in the ninetyth minute of the game.
After a first half without a goal for both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other matches for the Montreals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first game of the pre- and re-game series on Friday Impact, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a Seattle suburb had suffered a 2 to 1 defeat.
In the semi-finals, impact will be measured with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to balance a 3 to 1 deficit in Minnesota in the playoffs by a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps went into the semi-finals with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4 nonetheless.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short, the winner by Kovalev
The Canadian team’s No. 1 trio is ready to take on the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn drove the attack on the Panther from Florida with a firefight, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a goal, Plekanec delivered two drafts and Kovalev turned a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore into six preparatory games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of the entire shooting range.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel better.”
"He's too fixated on it in the first half," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received a stormy applause.'
Charest settles in the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out launching elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today's part-election.
<0x60>Move the course of our last great frontier in the north': this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the general meeting of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, where he fully followed the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, Quebec looked at in <0x60>Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large funds as during the election period.
The Prime Minister, by the way, refused to rule out that he would hold the elections this fall, even though he said he was confident that his schedule would be very full.
The ‘Plan Nord’ is the fourth element of a ‘Vision’ that the prime minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a ‘new economic space’, which provides for an agreement with France on workers, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches lately, the opening of the North - the northern area at the 49th latitude - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North is a “jewel with enormous potential”, but did not mention a date, no investment amounts or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At the very least, some perspectives on what more could be worked on: mainly on water energy, on the forest, but especially on the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr Charests, the north has nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds.
This <0x60>area twice as large as France' <0x60>is near us, is in Quebec.
It’s not just close to us, it’s in us,” he stressed, as if to clearly show that he’s looking to realize a national founder’s dream.
Quebec has grown very much due to its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
“It’s ours, it’s our future,” he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always requested, the prime minister told the press.
This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if there is an opportunity, I will take this position again on behalf of the government," he said.
“With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, talking about the Northwest Passage, which will be accessible throughout the year due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is almost an obligation to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would deal with them very carefully, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekist MP of Ungava) have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
A committee of ministers led by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Land Estimates) takes an important place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, “not necessarily a summit”, but an opportunity where “a common vision will be created”.
Moreover, the development of the North will be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “deliberate, regulated and environmentally sound,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this vision as a continuation of those of the Liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
“Like the Liberals who were in office before us, we’ve been thinking about turning the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
By the way, this was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party's takeover by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the Beauharnois power plant to Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,” said Charest.
He referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the 'Roads to the North' program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project hydropower dam Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stresses that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
‘That remains among us, but I intend to be there,’ he confided to his party members, which resulted in those storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has in fact not ruled out the possibility of holding an election this fall, which is possible to him by law.
However, he stresses that his schedule is full, mainly because of a joint council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend provided the Liberal Party Chief with a platform of nationalist plans, especially from <0x60>the objectives of the Constitution', which were adopted without further ado: the PLQ calls for the recognition of the <0x60>speciality of Quebecs' in the Constitution in particular.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Broadcasting Council, and that they have a veto over the decisions made in Quebec.
From the opposition side, the guidelines of the North Plan were taken up with skepticism.
The head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has reiterated the policy for the development of northern Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, did not apply them.
If she had done so, ‘we would have gone much further today,’ Ms Marois ruled on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is held today) Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed its support for the adoption of a plan by the government.
‘But what we want is that this is not just going to be a big show,’ party leader Sébastien Proulx said in a statement to Mario Dumont, who is coming back from the holidays today.
Letters - A Buried Country
Mr. Vic Toews, former Justice Minister (which irony) at Harper's office last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
This woman, who has waged a never-ending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover her up with shame, says as much about the people around the prime minister as she does about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that, as the only one from all the countries concerned, has not brought home its countryman trapped in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn’t even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things that happened to him happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier vegetate there under inhuman conditions.
The only one who succumbs to a legal parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us recall that, above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are pleading to bring Omar Khadr home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that also closes its eyes to torture: It is of little interest to her that a young adult after so many years the torment will surely be broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing here a mysterious trimming of our rights, our freedom and our ‘democracy’, this word which Harper is constantly carrying as a flag, and which sounds so unspoken from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no morality left: a Canadian citizen may be arbitrarily abused, tortured and imprisoned, according to the goodwill of a head of government, who until today is supported only by the minority (may he be a minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation at a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has let go of what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this letting go, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues, an Orwellian logic that the world’s largest gold mining company sought a defamation lawsuit of over six million against three authors and a small, mediocre publishing house, with the aim of opening a “public transparent debate.”
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of defamation lawsuits, but rather the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to drive everyone into ruin who dares to represent one of their opposing opinions.
No matter how the process goes, the authors and publishers of the Noir Canada book will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mines.
The tactic of these unequal struggles is, by the way, often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensual rule that makes the opposite side speechless and, moreover, deters anyone who dares to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things to the public.
Contrary to what is going on in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually carried out through the exchange of ideas and not through snippets.
So it would have sufficed if the gold mines had revealed their books and documents and opened up a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent audit teams that could have brought light to this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes out the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a handshake.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can ask for a 'public' debate at the same time, and yet at the same time miss the opinions of this public?
Apparently, this word in the world of the Vice President includes only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very nicely narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this primarily because it rejects the brutal attitude of goldmines.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a silly complaint (during the <0x60>public debate' Barrick Gold has just resorted to... using a demand to the authors of Noir Canada no longer address it to him.
Apart from Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and truth-finding that are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to cite credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss topics that the rich companies of this world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could conduct it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long known how to handle debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate claim clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures that limit these kinds of unjustified lawsuits.
Wall Street rescue campaign - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and the leading congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which is intended to stop the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months, has yet to be adopted by the two congressional chambers.
The main contents are: better control of MPs over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of public funds used, new provisions to reduce the number of houses due to payment backlogs, as well as the right to monitor the salaries of the companies entrusted to them.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative Judd Gregg announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
“We’ve made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective,” said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
“Everything has happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
"This is the fundamental point: if we don't do it, the trauma, the chaos and the unrest in the daily lives of Americans will be enormous," said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, out of fear of the effect that a relapse would have had on the mood of investors.
The deadline that had been agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two U.S. presidential candidates, who were only involved in the negotiations late, were more likely to be in favor of the deal, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction about meeting them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, especially those designed to allow owners to keep their homes, and those that affect the salaries of senior employees of state-run companies.
<0x60>If taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain persons, this is not something to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary," he said on U.S. television.
When asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: “I’d like to know the details first, but I hope so.
<0x60>The guidelines I have read [show] that this is a thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option to do nothing at all is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan is geared towards paying taxpayers' money.
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the plating of a real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprime) before expanding to further forms of distributed bonds (PCAA), and finally to freezing the financial power and ruining the banks and the ruins of the banks.
It was a group of Republican MPs who failed the first attempt to reach an agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain “toxic” assets of societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not bought, it is believed to escape the dead end.
To round off the viewpoints for everyone in Congress, a decree has also been added that if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, it could then raise new taxes in order to get back its invested capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of $250 billion, to which another $100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of an additional 350 billion must be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the aided companies that bring him in in case of winning dividends, and which can resell it once the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the option of suspending the mortgage proceedings in respect of the apartments that are bound to the real estate loans affected by this plan, and also setting deadlines for repayments and deductions to be paid to the leading employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the House of Representatives to vote on him today, and the Senate then on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get green light.
In fact, yesterday more votes were raised against this project, both by Republicans and Democrats.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t understand us,” said Republican Scott Garett, a member of the chamber’s finance committee, to his constituents.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are in the business of asking taxpayers for cash.'
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called the ‘caucus of skeptics’, presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred distinguished economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to inform us: We ask Congress not to be pressured and to carefully consider which way to go,” he said.
At the same time, we in Europe once again got the proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion (US$16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, which has been in great trouble since it took 2 billion euros (US$2.9 billion in risk) in the crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not a lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
For compensation, we receive a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announcing.”
During this time, on the other side of the sleeve canal, the British government was just about to nationalize another bank that was in trouble from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all ongoing loans from Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the UK bank’s branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to be nationalized by the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis after Northern Rock.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a Committed Icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was his trump for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor get rid of the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sense of touch, his sensitivity, and an obvious talent have probably kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrifying monsters to life.
But what a great permanent runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for which he was a kind of rival on the screen for a long time, more careful in his play, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the bursting of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often results in wonderful children.
He was born in 1925 in Ohio as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-born mother.
From its European roots one of the glorious faces of the American dream should arise.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality characteristic.
For in him a whole country, which was in love with the self-made man, reflected in the fighter who was injured in the battle in the Pacific War, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s, and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he also had success at the theater, on television and on television.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became Mans Zweiter in 1979 at the 24-hour race, and also a sex symbol, although he and actress Joanne Woodward had been living in a preview relationship since 1958.
With him, too, the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrained, committed, and over-sensitive star of the show business, whose mystery will never be completely solved, disappear.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans put the cinema lovers this weekend in Taumel, while on the dark screen of memories all his great roles were played.
More than half a century of American filmmaking is constantly changing with him.
Then again, the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) plunges into the memory, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Sheet Roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
It will evoke a much shorter-standing memory (1990), which will wake up to its sensitive Mr. Bridge, who at his senior age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all of her promises.
So many other Paul Newmans there were in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, was re-recorded after his death and made the Newman real-life appearance in 1956.
This sympathetic ganove in the outstanding The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded the 1973 Oscar for Best Film.
As a bitter and greedy billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the ages, it was.
He's still here.
In the course of his life, epochs unite.
He is best known for his role in George Roy Hill's cult film Slap Shot (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the unorthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role in 2003 as Pate of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several film legends who have withdrawn from the film world early enough, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, while betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his pruning and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the <0x60>underplaying', when he judged his all-too-expressive performances.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles only flew for a long time.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotic, alcoholic, fiddle, or desperate, with the perfect portrayal he reflected his slip-up and uplifting.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown pages of his true sensitive sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of compassion and sadness.
In the flood of honours that took place yesterday over Newman ergoss, his close friend and former fellow gunman Robert Redford (who had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared: ‘His presence has improved my life and this country.’
Generosity and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, he is now also a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of the Hollywood drift.
We have probably often seen him standing with his feet in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this was considered quite tasteless, although we still found it funny at first.
The profits from his sales, however, flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman became involved in the shooting.
He left a letter to his five daughters with these phrases: ‘Always and to the very end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.”
And for us it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoicing factory by Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, negotiations in the criminal trial against J<0xC3><0xA1>no’s surcharge and his accomplices will begin.
In particular, the defendants are accused of involvement in organized crime, as well as grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts - including document falsification.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the funds earned from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services rendered were often proven with false invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-administration - total HUF 65 million - are to have been partly invested in the funds of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal, partly in the private funds of the individual.
As the investigating authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted in relation to the tenders, and the associations are not supposed to have fulfilled their obligations either.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were faked.
The invoicing blocks were purchased at the market of J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was decided on that round trip north of Lake Platten, to which Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados was sent by J<0xC3><0xA1>no's surcharge.
In the course of this "exploration tour", Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He asked for consumer invoices in order to later issue invoices based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest.
These invoices are said to have been manipulated mostly by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and his accomplice, Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, the latter being responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports according to our information.
One of the goals of Lados' "Reconnaissance Tour" was a beer venue.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003, the catering company is said to have awarded the nine-member group of the association Biztos Pont S<0xC3><0xB6>g<0xC3><0xBC>let.
Now, however, the head of the company says that such a large group would not have suddenly fitted into the premises.
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later known as Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, also showed serious errors in form and content.
In a guest house in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, according to the invoice, 130 guests have stayed.
The imagination of the accountants was apparently also not set limits when it came to the Pigal Ltd., a restaurant business, in whose accounting documents the customers Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> do not even appear, according to the prosecution.
As CEO Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas of hvg.hu informed, it was immediately clear to him that these were falsified documents when documents were presented to him by the prosecutor’s office during an investigation.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly affixed to the stamp".
And further: Apart from form errors, the fact that the establishment was supposed to have accommodated one hundred people was also wrong, after having a total of eleven rooms, which are impossible to accommodate so many people.
The restaurant has also been listed on the bill of lading, the restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The emigrating auditors also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they visited exclusively offered to travel abroad, and so they indicated Hungarian travel on the cash payment account, which also contradicted the company’s accounting practice.
As announced in the course of the investigations, they have also included VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The amount of value added tax was incorrect on four invoices issued by Hotel Révf<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xB6>p Kft. to the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, since the operation is charged instead of 25 only 15 percent VAT, in addition, only machine invoices are issued by the employees, but the forged documents were handwritten.
Another error that was subject to the "invoice holders" was that they had stated in a case "goods transport" as a delivered performance, although this is not offered by the firm specializing in investment consulting, the prosecutor's office said.
Further errors in form - false invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued by the Third <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny and the XXI Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Cultural Association and Biztos Pont could be disclosed as counterfeits.
Likewise, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> sports camp, whose managing directors claimed never to have issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" is that of the counterfeiters at HIB Kft. from Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za: This company was in disarray at the time (2001) when the group of the Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Association was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore stated that the invoices had not been issued himself.
Consciously falsified
The other group of accountants are people who were fully aware that they would have to make fictitious invoices.
At the request of the Fiat Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Sozialist<0xC3><0xA1>k, the foundation Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny has issued invoices for the Foundation Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, in the amount of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
The Biogate Kft., which is also currently in liquidation, is also expected to have cooperated with Zuschlag and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH will have the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation, as well as the Atlasz Association and V<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>sfeny<0xC5><0x91> Association with false invoices in the total value of HUF 5.
However, there was also little payment traffic, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, which, however, the affected persons forgot to notice in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons who are directly connected with the defendants.
One of them is Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian CEO of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Ltd., a fuel and vehicle trading company located in Budapest, but not found there.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices for the sale of EDV components in the total value of HUF about 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is said to have acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romania to which the company documents should also be delivered by Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigation, Kubatov has stated that he has issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH to the associations Atlasz and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1>, as well as to Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny and has cashed their own equivalents.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were supposed to have been founded by Romanian Moors on Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov’s express wish.
In fact, none of these companies were active, which according to the defendant was on missing orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was in charge of preparing the company’s founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with surcharge, such as Atlasz and Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3>.
In total, Kubatov has issued 15 invoices totalling HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The prosecutor’s office assumes that Kubatov could have cashed 10% of the invoice amount as well as the value added tax in each case.
Kubatov is said to have even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>c<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3> and Sz<0xC3><0xB6>vetség a Modern Magyar<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>gr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>tért submitted their applications to the non-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but these amounts were used for purposes of foreigners.
To hide this, they have submitted five fictitious invoices of the Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
By the way, these invoices were secured during the investigation of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, some defendants are now being charged with a confession of the method of accounting forgery, as they have already been filed before the public prosecutor’s office.
It could be a sensation if the main defendant, J<0xC3><0xA1>nos, decides to make a full confession.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to report comprehensively on everything, his confession still stands.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him with regard to reimbursing the bulk of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether a surcharge in return is willing to assume the responsibility.
It is quite possible, however, that the surcharge now plays the "afflicted" after his requests for mitigation of the detention and house arrest had fallen on deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have done far greater damage with economic crimes and have not compensated for them, are on foot, or at least under house arrest, supplementation remains denied this possibility.
The psychology of overspending – or why we’re willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overestimate the wrong bidder.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the “Science” magazine, people in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, don’t want to give up and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was supposed to play the lotto while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, however, increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, was measured in the losers of the auction, in which the opponent's overtaking plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore considered that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group have also conducted research to track the money.
In this case, three groups should compete against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward, in case they emerge as the winner of the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was simply that the emphasis was on one on winning while the other on losing.
As evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the “against losing” group were willing to make higher stakes than those in the control or “win” group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
In fact, the behaviours observed at auctions so far have only been based on the joy of winning or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories was solved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so we now have a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When is the doctor to visit?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected is estimated to be one hundred thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - inflammation of the liver and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses are spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E by the digestive tract (for example by contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, secretion or saliva).
Travelers are advised to get vaccinated against viruses A and B at least, and there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A show up about two to three weeks after consuming the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and brittleness.
After that, the yellowing occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes light, the urine dark, and the recovery can last up to two to three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from the more serious diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and hepatic cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only one in ten people infected is in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen mysteriously destroys the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular control examinations, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable during a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the GP at the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognized in time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby banishing the risk of infection and preventing the formation of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, 2004 for the first time by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of these chronic inflammation of the liver caused by viruses, their origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research shows, religious faith acts as a kind of "painkiller" that is said to have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: it was investigated how much faith in God affects the pain of man, reported the British newspaper "Telegraph".
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electroshocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to turn off most of the pain.
Using a brain scan technology, it could even be proven that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from different departments of the university also participate.
During the experiment, the tester was connected to the left hand of a sparkling device, which gave off the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand an image of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would evoke a sort of religious trance while choosing da Vinci’s image because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt calm.
The subjects each spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time received a total of 20 electroshocks in four stages, while they were supposed to watch either the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they had felt "safe" in the sight of the Mother of God, as if they were "careful", and they had felt "peace and tranquility".
While viewing the religious painting, they reported about 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo’s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be caused by other, strongly acting images even among atheists, one would just have to find the corresponding photo.
“We would have to find an image that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father,” says the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“The practice of faith should change our personality, and it does so in many cases,” Wright said.
After these excellent results, the only question remains what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another similar painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you say about yourself.
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can assert with fugue and right: it’s in people’s pockets just as much as over their heads in the sky: she knows where people spent their holidays, what doctors they go to, and what moves them.
And that’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google’s CEOs.
In the direction of skeptics plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he lets align: these would just ignore the essentials of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said Google’s main goal was to collect even more personal data about users and thus get closer to the company’s original goal of “ordering all the information in this world.”
Schmidt said Google was still only at the beginning of the information collection after ten years of changing world work.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google would be able to answer questions like “What should I do tomorrow?” or “Which job really suits me?” but software programs are not yet able to because they didn’t know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware of the fact that, in the course of their internet searches, the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search history and later resort to it, so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and on the same logic also based the so-called "recommendations" based on the so-called "recommendations", with which the system is based.
However, users are wondering what happens in the event of a data abuse - "If you look at what I do" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company, which is fear-inspiring, and less the sense of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the urge to resist the power that is being rejected by many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of an incident, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
An example of this was recently the procedure against pedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which Google provided information to the Brazilian government, which was collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of pedophilia.
For personal rights concerned users, however, were still able to breathe in May when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully sued the FBI, which means that Google cannot be forced to release information to the FBI on a secret request in the future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the issuance of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, but has retained the list of individual users, or their web and search terms list, for two months.)
So Google’s image remains controversial: Those who refuse to release their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy through the use of Google’s services, the company is rife with the outrage that the conservative companies are charging.
However, the American “Geek culture” that is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users alike, sees the next generation of “cool entrepreneurs” in them, as opposed to Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not ask its users for identification codes, and provides its services free of charge, making an open, constantly updated source code and program package appear far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official software practices.
On the other hand, the geeks are looking at the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet of Things – a relationship that has been centralised in recent years thanks in particular to the term “Web 2.0”.
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing more than collaboration, that is, the users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show itself publicly.
An average teenager can manage his profile simultaneously on several community portals – from Facebook to Xanga, through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually merge all of this into an automatic tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When looking at last night’s party photos, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend has had fun with, or the employee is fired because in his blog he was just too honest with his anger about running the company, “I’m sure he’s getting aired with: one thing is certain:
Who leads an online life is what he presents himself - so in some way one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And those who try to keep something secret, or even bypass the Google monopoly, may like to do so – like with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google’s search engine, but deliberately leaves no traces.
Not a few people intentionally do not register on community sites so that they cannot be found, but also Google’s online applications, such as word processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore not the best of the best.
Public opinion, however, is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising spaces of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, and the increasingly uninitiated services of other software developers.
Critical observers, however, also find a disturbing counter-pole: For example, the Group management would reject a protest of employees completely, after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, in addition, the management thought that the multiple catering of employees was too costly, but in 2006 all of this, in spite of the fact that in fact, Google just moved to a mile
The internal regulation of the company is that in advance no new service will be advertised, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could again have a lot of force: while some think that Google’s book and magazine scanning and archiving project is being carried out in such a way that the company is now taking on the scale
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors are already delivering the substance - for example, "Scroogled", Cory Doctorow's famous novel describes in the best orwellian way a future in which a human being becomes appallingly close thanks to Google-related data.
Two teenagers help <0xC3><0x93>zd's double murderer in the removal of traces
In connection with the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, the police have now interrogated two youths who are suspected of helping to remove the tracks, police commissioner Borsod's spokesman said on Tuesday.
The youths were consistent, they are currently being accused of aid.
According to information from the news agency MTI, these are two girls who defend themselves on foot.
Aid is threatened with a sentence of up to five years.
The suspect in the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of deliberately murdering several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigations, it turned out that the 23-year-old had owed a greater amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to pay off his debts, so he lured his creditor to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the act by a long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warschauer B<0xC3><0xB6>rse makes purchase offer for Prague B<0xC3><0xB6>rse
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered to buy the Prague Stock Exchange’s 100 percent share package.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that the Poles had made despite the fact that they had previously been excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange completely belongs to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to reports of the Czech daily "E15", the offer of the Poles includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche B<0xC3><0xB6>rse have made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he also did not conclude that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Cesk<0xC3><0xA1> Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments devoted to the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers on Tuesday already spoke of the "second September 11".
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, for example, meant “La Repubblica” – the president was not even able to turn his own party over to the bill behind him, which should bring some relief into the frightening situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor,” as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to talk about a “second 9/11.”
Parts of the press in Madrid also found the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and under it the whole world will suffer.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but after the vote in Congress, there is a risk that Washington will not have a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air, precisely at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
You can no longer ignore the threat, for example, the Geneva "days-shower" means.
While some states could still provide their money-strapped financial institutions with bailouts, the banks could save taxpayers’ money from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks are still being sued, no further financial injections or other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralize control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion was paid out to debilitating financial institutions, the Viennese "The Standard" recalls. Moreover, the newspaper continues, the concerns are becoming more realistic that after the Americans, the European taxpayers now have to take a little deeper into their pockets in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is now sweeping across the old continents like a tsunami.
Although the "savers" would not have to immediately "swallow" with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to keep in mind in which case it would be reasonable to charge taxpayers' money to compensate for even greater damage.
Intelligent car mimics the flight of the hummel
What would be the best way to develop new accident prevention technologies if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented in which the Nissan engineers were inspired by Hummeln in the creation of new accident avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C type autorobot-controlled biomimetic system, a mini car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The compound eye of the bees, which can be seen in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
To mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers came up with the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision-preventing process.
The obstacle is recorded in fractions of seconds, and the autorobot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
“If it wasn’t, the autorobot couldn’t react fast enough to avoid the obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the autorobot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer that is now considered inevitable within the accidents.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees if they evade other bees.
And that has to happen in the fraction of a second.
However, the deviation, unlike the bees, can not take place up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, namely only in the direction of the reversibility of the tires.
While the bees here are endlessly open to avoid other bees, the researchers at the autorobot could only use rotational motion, or acceleration and braking.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer service life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and respond accordingly to them.
It doesn’t have to store it, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction using previous maneuvers, so it only uses a handful of KB memory on a regular basis.
It doesn’t require gigabyte and megabyte-heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, which is expected to be in production as standard within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously steering the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the destination.
A Name for the Sinful Child
Now, the written version of the $700 billion bailout bill is available, which will be applicable in several stages and is aimed at buying bad loans from banks.
In the first step, half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight on the East Coast local time, the congressmen, after several days of debate, have gone through a deal over the 700-billion-dollar bailout package, Reuters reported.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, and said the agreement only had to be put on paper.
The compromise reached on the bailout was supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said the programme will have an impact and it will be efficient, but more needs to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about removing the rubble of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening 8 o'clock (Central European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning), but did not trigger a high-flying on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the 2008 draft law to stabilize the economy, then the Senate will be in line.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
“We are pleased with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy,” said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman.
However, the program deviates from the Bush administration’s original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once on the purchase of faulty, credit-laden securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the $700 billion is to be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This amount is to be spent on the purchase of credit-laden, bad securities, and over the remaining $100 billion is to be spent.
The program is reviewed by its own commission, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion depends on another congressional decision.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-laden securities, or other “toxic” loans.
As the competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the funds to be concerned and the companies pay the corresponding fees for the damages to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: “The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be made available as an immediate aid to the American financial system, whether it be for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk caused by the collapse of a larger monetary institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it has been signed, Paulson said.
However, the heads of the banks that have been in trouble and are now relying on state aid can expect their shipments, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas hose, to be cut by the government.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance each helps.
The abbreviation essentially means that if the ministry purchases as part of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed unless the outgoing bank manager is sent to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the foul loans, the government will aggressively switch on to ensure that the management salaries are not overstated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake agreements will not be changed – the restrictions only refer to new agreements, so that more and more people are participating in the program.
This is the first time in American history that reductions in manager salaries are regulated by law, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, the measure.
The state gains participation rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate once the economy and thus also the saved bank get better again.
The bill provides that the president must submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years to get taxpayers back their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens expect of us, the plan does not protect taxpayers’ money in any way, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures were advanced by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, compared to August 2007, by 12.9 percent.
Export prices were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008, and fell by 3.9% compared to the previous year.
Due to price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2 percent higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices have risen only slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
The sales prices of the processing industry have also risen little - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was in leather goods (2.8 per cent) - mainly in bags and belts - here the increase was 4.6 per cent, in shoes prices went by 2.5 per cent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials pushed prices for chemicals and productions to a significant level (1.6 percent).
A drop in prices was recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 per cent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 per cent), and wood processing (0.1 per cent).
The prices in paper production, as well as in publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the major domestic sales markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the increase in gas prices introduced on July 1.
Considering the domestic sales markets of the processing industry in comparison to the year, prices in crude oil processing have risen the most strongly (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, an increase of 13.2% was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
A price decline was observed in the textile industry (2.5 per cent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 per cent).
The level of taxation in the other processing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
In the domestic sales market, the highest price increase was recorded in the investment goods sector in August (0.7 percent).
In the production sectors for consumer goods, prices increased by 0.3 percent, while they remained the same in the energy and further processing sectors compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector compared to the comparison period of 2007 (16.8 per cent).
In the sectors producing consumer goods, a price increase of 6.8 per cent was observed, with investment goods a price reduction of 1.4 per cent.
The export prices of the industry measured in Forint rose by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, however, there was a decrease of 3.9 per cent year-on-year.
The domestic currency grew by 1.7 percent compared to the euro, 7.1 percent weaker to the dollar, and compared to the August 2007 exchange rate, it grew by 7.5 percent compared to the euro, with the dollar even 15.9 percent stronger.
No more visas to the United States from 2009?
Kinga G<0xC3><0xB6>ncz sees a good chance that the U.S.-Hungarian visa agreement will come into force on January 12, as the Foreign Minister declared before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In your opinion, "everything now depends on whether the electronic immigration or control system is being introduced overseas in time."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy is currently conducting negotiations in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will present her with the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she also conducts talks with the foreign policy advisors of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bailout for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major U.S. parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
The Congress and government representatives, after days of marathon consultations on Sunday, announced that they had reached an agreement on the bank bailout package.
The crisis of Wall Street, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain both claim to be better than their respective opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain Hoch, who gave him the presentation of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, has at the same time melted into it.
At an election campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly adopt the bill over the $700 billion heavyweight package.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he supported with.
“We need to act now, responsibly ... your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened,” he told 35,000 viewers.
He did not fail to describe McCain’s economic visions as “obsolete.”
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, "We're all going to have a hard time dealing with this ... but nothing is going to be an alternative."
The Republican senator said the plan also prescribes the setting up of a control commission for the finance minister, as well as restricting clearances for top managers – something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not played a definite role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press view of the German-speaking area
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so "Der Spiegel" commented on the weak performance of CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine based on the left, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the CSU’s dramatic defeat in his article “Bayern’s Revolution kills her fathers”.
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over its offices.
The Christian social groups have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
At the same time, the epoch break is a problem of Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
Unsurprisingly, the CSU disaster did not come to an end, but something happened on Sunday, which was already quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
For ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU fell to 47.7 percent, falling for the first time since the 1950s to the 50 percent mark.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 federal election, i.e. in the much-cited Stoiber era.
The modernization, which has been consistently carried out by the CSU in the Federal Republic of Germany, has ultimately destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at the same time greatly appreciated at the pace. But without consequences, secularization, educational success, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain to the fidelity of the CSU voters.
Modernisation always goes hand in hand with the proliferation of options, and this has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and willing.
It is noteworthy that in recent weeks, almost the classical civic groups have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with qualifications such as university degrees.
The CSU’s support fell to less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Wiener Dageszeitung reports in its "Who with whom? Party chiefs reluctant in coalition issues" articles titled about the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the involvement of the SP<0xC3><0x96> in internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to establish themselves in relation to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it’s all about the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the party leaders hardly let their cards look.
SP<0xC3><0x96> chief Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current <0xC3><0x96>VP chief as vice-chancellor, Faymann left open.
As he said, the voters would have chosen the bowl-molder course.
There is no question of a repetition of this direction.
Molterer, however, responded cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, when Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or in the coalition, is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
BZ<0xC3><0x96>-Chief J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
“To prevent red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibility,” Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, which will be hosted by the EU Presidency of the Council of France this year.
In her speech to the plenary, L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, Member of the Fidesz Group of the European People's Party, drew attention, in particular, to the segregation of education, as this is one of the most serious violations of the law that Roma children face, and this is the biggest obstacle to the problem.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency of the Council, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and citizen organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the press office of the MEPs of Fidesz reports, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka has pointed out that in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma would be primarily displaced from the labour market due to their low level of education.
“The vast majority of Roma youth have no middle school education, and thanks to poor primary school education, only a small part of them can achieve a university degree.”
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right, which plays a key role in the promotion of other human rights.
Investments in early education for Roma children can strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
In the opinion of the Members, it is important that these relations become aware of the widest possible circle - i.e. Rome and non-Rome.
For the earlier a Roma student starts school, the greater the chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; and through income and sales tax they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to quality education - poor and segregated education must be stopped," said L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
As the honourable Member has stated, a joint, objective and action-oriented action by the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of disintegration in the education sector, and to this end it is essential to comply with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
“We must break through the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens,” J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
Since last year’s Congress in Berlin, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the promotion of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European and national levels, in the sense of the “European Year of Equal Opportunities”.
CSU: Grace in Time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein is decided
Despite the election debacle, there are still no heads at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the staff debates were postponed.
Party chief Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem after the disastrous 17 percent loss of vote will be decided on the last weekend of October on the extraordinary party day.
But the much trained duo already made it clear that it does not want to stick to their chairs.
Thus, they want to appease the angry faction and the party base, which, one day after the "Bayrian tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority, demanded personal consequences.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at his peak in his career - the Christian Social Union still reached 60.7 percent. However, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the vote.
For 46 years, the CSU has been a “Lone Governor” in Bavaria, generating 18 percent of Germany’s GDP.
Although the conservatives remain the determining force in the southern federal state that is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party’s internal restructurings, the potential successor of Huber, Vice President and Federal Minister of Defence Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team, which will engage with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing “Free Voter” specializing talks on a possible M<0xC3><0xBC>nchneral.
An irony of fate is that with the list of "Free Voters" that Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-Stoiberian appearance the Huber-Beckstein Duo first took advantage of, then mercilessly reserved the ambitious politician.
The CSU leadership is now focusing all its efforts on stabilizing Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who so far pulled the threads from the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU chairman called September 28 the "worst day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made some toxic remarks towards CDU - in his opinion, the CSU would have earned far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a lot to success at the national level in 2005, is not put back on its feet with a common act of force, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor again after the federal elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment over the failure, believes that the CSU’s land loss will not have a negative impact on the big coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition has succeeded in the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this lies in the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects that there are legal differences in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognized the elections.
Although the legislature of the 10 million-people-state would have been without opposition for decades, the opposition party gathered under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections has seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who was a candidate for the election, would become a member of the Parliament, would be a member of the opposition party.
That is why the ODS has even distanced itself from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine has become increasingly economically dependent on the import of natural gas from Russia thanks to rising prices. For the relief of price increases, loans have even been received, and the country has also agreed to sell the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading through the country, to the Ukrainians, to the Ukrainians, to the Russians, to the contrary.
For a temporary relaxation, the OECD’s assessment report provided for the elections, in which the emphasis was rather on positive movements rather than on shortcomings – such as the exclusion of a third of opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD’s quick report on Monday criticised the campaign – which is why opposition figures should not be in the press – and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to recognize an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free for example, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow, by continuing to recognize the independence of the remote Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, refusing to accept the independence of the Russian Federation as a deterrent to the Russian Federation.
“We have taken two steps forward and one step backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” Milinkewitsch said.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have become afraid to leave even one opposition in parliament".
The opposition does not plan any protest measures in view of the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform for voters.
"We have here to fight with many problems - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the way of selling stones, but still I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even the older ones" - said Ver<0xC3><0xBC>tzszent, according to a statement from the Verzischen-Verziszent, a spokesman for the German government.
“Thanks to the country’s debt and the rise in the trade deficit, it’s only a matter of time before the ‘social security’ that evokes the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble,” Milinkewitsch said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the facts, not the words". The lack of opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast will be served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are revolving doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
As of today, the measure will come into force against those mudslides that first stamp and then go for coffee drinks during working hours.
The new “Anti-Faulpelz Act” was introduced today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Council of Ministers’ Presidium.
“Swivel doors are a means to increase work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services,” said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency is beginning.
This is reformism,” Brunetta said.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the inauguration ends in all the buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of revolving doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance on the part of the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides".
All in all, there is now no more breakfast during working hours; end with coffee or croissant.
Brunettetas advises with a smile: "A good Cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Upper Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
In Rome, the minister announced that “within three months, the absences of officials have reduced to 50%, meaning 60,000 more people per year are present at work.”
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration.
"Their wage dynamics - according to the minister - have been twice as large as the private sector and far above the inflation rate in the last 8-10 years."
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have come together to counteract the Brunetta decree as part of the Codacons-backed appeal.
"While the Minister of Public Service is profiled with figures on lower absenteeism at work - according to the Consumer Centre - the people of 'actual fouls' are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable public service officials have come together to declare war against the illegal norms of the decree.”
In particular, the regional administrative court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness; so is the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which control visits can be made and other aspects of the minister's innovations.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 work accidents occur, three people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For the year 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul travailo) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were around 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as caused by murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invaldi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy will celebrate the 58th National Day for Victims of Work Accidents, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention in the workplace is," the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano confirms in his message to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale del Mercilati ed.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of workplaces, to the protection of injured workers, to the assistance of victims' families and to the sensitization of public opinion".
"An impoverished "basta" has risen to this; of course, in tragedies that, measured by their order of magnitude, trigger some vortex in the media and participation of the public, but the everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even re-emerge in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that “there is definitely also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information.”
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness in school settings by young people who are feeding on the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to deviate from its social seriousness; one must put into force and improve a legislative norm.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on decisive rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
“The data of the accidents at work seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is much too high,” says Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
“We don’t want this ‘positive trend’ to mean less attention, which is what ultimately causes the tragedy.”
"How do you think you're basically doing too little to deal with the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight it through various actions.
Stronger controls and inspections are, in our opinion, necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate workers who are already starting in school.”
"An additional effort is necessary - he adds - in terms of communication and the sensitization of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency is called for".
Mercandelli also called for "the progressive deterioration of protection for victims of accidents at work" and criticized the "abolition of the social system that we have been fighting against in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return to the worker a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of a work accident does not depend on voluntary or incidental donations, which are decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 Player under indictment: Risk of hearing loss
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which cites the opinion of the EU's Csrseri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) in a report published in Brussels today.
“It is clear from the report that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music for at least five years a week for at least an hour a day with portable music devices are at risk of permanent hearing loss.”
“I’m concerned that such a large number of young people, who usually use portable music devices and mobile phones, are putting their hearing aids at a high volume, without knowing it, irreparably damaging,” said Meglena Kuneva.
“From the scientific findings – so the EU says – there is a clear risk that is pushing for rapid action.
What really counts is to raise awareness among consumers and make this information public.
Given these scientific findings, we need to reassess the already existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had appointed the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people.
"The scientists - as the EU communication concludes - confirm that one is too concerned and that the EU Commission will now, together with the other EU members and those affected, examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise that can be heard from portable musical instruments, instruments and headphones.
There is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB. Concern about the damage that could come from an excessive noise load.
These damages can be very limited, in which solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of the noise exposure can be tackled.
In its report, the EU Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable music devices only listen to music loud for five hours a week (more than 89 decibels) so that the legal limits have already been exceeded, the maximum noise level at the workplace applies.
Those who exceed this limit in music risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
That is 5-10% of users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno to launch the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, in March it is supposed to be over, in June the balance will be drawn.
This is the procedure laid down by the Chapter for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome" and the Commission met this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will work out the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the City Council and the City Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," Alemanno stressed. "It will put forward proposals for a development plan for Rome, which will remain politically responsible for the city and the municipal council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, their task will be completed and the Commission will be dissolved again, as such a project must have a fixed end point in time.
In June - as the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work carried out by the Commission".
Those who question the Commission's competence, because their opinion lacks commitment, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and the quality of its proposals.
If, like the Attali Commission in France, it delivers high-quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period in view in order to work seriously with a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city."
The Mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will make us think; it will occupy the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, “it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to make a leap in quality – which it really needs – and thus take a common step into the future.”
A future, according to the mayor of Rome, which "will not only limit itself to the current municipal borders, but will look much further", not only as regards the role of Rome as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here’s a statement
A well-known American politician, much to be regarded as independent, has written: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the U.S. economy and maintained relations with finite Islam (and still does this as a private man today).
The attacks on Obama are becoming more and more violent, right now, as the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an internet site: “This person is full of ambition.
Obama is very rude: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!”
In fact, these attacks don’t have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don’t answer the voters’ question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says Obama will win with a big lead.
Also in this case there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in its editorial: it is only in the polling booth that we will know who the real American patriot will give his voice to.
Here comes a U.S. mentality that has been kept hidden until the end.
“Say what you want, then we’ll decide who we’re going to do our job for, whether for Obama or McCain.”
There are people out there who swear that if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard before – only now, where the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his term in office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a step in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush’s weak point.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not declare to those who were not really concerned about the information concerning the competent authorities because of the general credibility.
You don’t feel as alone as before.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the big problems come from the cuts that hit the newsroom, that is, the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if one wants to prevent traditional journalism, as the general public understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism meets the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and senior executives in the press believe that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
In the local area, it is even 65% among executives.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in which direction the web is going.
The main publishing groups are paving the way to the Internet, which is considered by many as the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping "it brings something good to journalism".
The biggest gap in American journalism today is between the editor-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters working for them.
56% of the editors-in-chief at national level are confident, their reporters share their values with them, while at local level there are only 23%.
Some think it has to do with “safety at work.”
Managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
For journalists, it is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", ed.) is always a current topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million residents and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and internet operators, employers offer them how they like it and so it becomes a question of take it or leave it.
The editor-in-chief often receives very high wages, while the editor can sometimes receive only 10000 euros per month, including pension and insurance.
As for the holiday, the thing becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach after a certain number of years 15 vacation days.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, will often become “ill” over the course of the year.
It is a question of climate.
UNIPOL: GERICT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate agent, who had asked to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the counter agreement investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (against which the public prosecutor’s office had spoken) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain evidence against him.
The elite is in danger.
The phenomenon had already emerged a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the White House’s $700 billion austerity package: A large part of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms yesterday’s issue of the New York Times, which reports on how the crisis in the run-up to the Republican Party sweeps away, which increasingly splits into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favoured the state institutions and the business community, and which “severals” against the neoconservatives in Washington and the “sweeps in Washington.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example, however, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the United States, but also in the entire West and perhaps beyond will be affected by them.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-feared events that finally take shape under these new conditions and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unheard-of renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions that have close ties to foreign countries and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the assets of private households living in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for governments: how to behave towards the families concerned, which are also a huge number of voters.
So the crisis appears economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have gotten away with it and lost its right to speak: the obvious proof of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into various national and international conflicts, does not know how to find a common way.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and even distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis has become more and more serious, only the United States is economically able to save itself without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus two non-overvalued conditions – under certain circumstances – on which no international organization or market will be able to resort in a similar way.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed on the state-national element is in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that has recently been associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is just now that we were so convinced that we had entered a connected whole realm for a long time, into a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of immaterializing that we need to suddenly determine how our future will increasingly depend on the essential material things: water, harvesting and oil.
While these can all be transported from one place to another in the world, they are still connected to a narrowly circumscribed piece of Earth—a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is advantageous to another who lives in an area that is uncultivated, water-free or oil-free.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a brief introduction.
Who territory, who government, who says politics, then also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to create two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, i.e. the need for someone who knows how to manage things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of dissatisfaction over the existing leaderships, such as those of the economy, which have emerged as insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a certain sense, even more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an indifference, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of distance, all of which is directed at a whole class of managers of Western countries.
It seems to me that the belief among large parts of the population seems to pave the way that it is not first the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content represents the majority as always foreign and superior.
The demand for leadership is thus subterranean, and a branched but powerful movement of the demilitarization of the leading class and of the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in the unexpected "revolts" of the voters and in the unmediated upheaval of the collective state of mind of the last century.
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value regarding what is going on in the lower social and financial strata of the West.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that lets you go up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which has now seemingly almost reached its destination.
With an adhesive applied on an area of only 2.5 qcm, the researchers managed to fix a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of adhesive can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged to a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic claws that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holding capacity of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "makes it easy to remove from the wall", says Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a passable adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps, but the researchers think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall within the scope of space travel.
For the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new kind of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, California scientists present an adhesive made of microfibers that clean themselves from dust, like hair, by moving on a surface itself.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Be careful with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and vitamin content, especially in the summer, can cause serious health damage when taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packaged as well as fresh fruit juices in conjunction with medication intake. As part of the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again struck the alarm: Medicaid is sufficient to consume a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, antiasthma, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, to toxic levels.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM – The same agency of the drug had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mixture in a report two years ago, and stressed to pay attention to what is drunk in conjunction with drugs such as diazepam or methadone.
ES IS NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the drugs.
The list of active substances inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Michele Carruba, Director of the Universit<0xC3><0xA0> Statale di Milano, said: “Such results are usually immediately communicated to the various international manufacturers, who are thus free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still uncertainties, not to be afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor,” the expert of the Ansa Agency emphasizes.
Nobel Prize in Economics goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded to American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more crucial to U.S. history than the attacks.
A prediction that received not much controversy as an answer and was presented to the economist years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
“I’m surprised and shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals as part of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the public eye,” Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style that targets especially against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package appears
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source software wins as a free replacement for Microsoft’s Office an ever-increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both under freelancers and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself with some new features to the public: in addition to a revised and now more Spartan-designed start menu, it is now finally a new Forpenat as a basis for guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system.
In addition, eight opposed to the compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as those that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which, for example, makes it easier to send via email. This also includes the ability to import PDF files into graphics processing modules and at the same time to view the original appearance of the page.
So now you can also generate "hybrid" PDFs, which extend the typical Adobe format graphic around the elements of a table and a text processing system.
The collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited by several different users, thus avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the word processing system, a query is assigned to each editor in order to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently publishing various OpenOffice features on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result is expected to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. It follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
While freedom can be an incentive for the spread of the program in private households, it is also in the area of business where OpenOffice could succeed: after all, various public administration institutions and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized businesses, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the spreadsheet program that aims to push Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as with Powerpoint; Dbase to run databases instead of the more familiar access; and lastly, Draw.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can easily exceed 3 million and 600 thousand already reached.
Also cabbage tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
There is a new doping case within the framework of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is third class and winner of the best climber’s jersey.
The news was published by the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old coach from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver to have tested positive for Cera, the third-generation Epo, before this happened to the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from Kohl’s blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the labs Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the opposite samples now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French Anti-Doping Commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive test, and warned the Austrian authorities, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian stepped on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEMA APPROACH: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION: IS ITALY RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are admitted only with objections.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article devoted entirely to the topic of racism in Italy, which stems from the case of the young, Burkina Faso-born Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he stole a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times calls the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and employment opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiment and the greatest support of the Lega Nord is to be found".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new anti-immigrant legislation introduced by the League and for the faster deportation of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also underscores the Pope and the President of the State: “Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal to cooperate between the Church and the State to combat racism.”
Students victims of up to 900 euros per room high rental prices
The housing market for students is in crisis.
According to the latest survey by the Sunia, the rental union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken very serious moves, and quite a few students are actually losing their right to study because their families are not able to support them at this level," says the head of the Sunia, Laura Mariani, "in these cities the great demand from the students has also led to the great demand of Mark the Desche.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized rentals.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which lead to lower rental prices due to a revision of the tax.
With a closer look at the investigation, it turns out that in Milan, a sleeping place in the Brianza district is needed around 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, an average sleeping place costs 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where the students concentrate in the districts around the university, 250/280 euros for a sleeping place of need, 370 to 500 euros for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the districts around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 euros for a double bedroom.
The rents in the neighbourhoods around the other universities of Rome are only slightly lower: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>.
Only those who escape in outer districts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is 25-30% above the average is required by foreign students.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the favored multiplex cinemas.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the large urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-seater complexes in the periphery, in the long run means death for the single-seater cinema in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocably, but also carries the triggers of a cultural crime.
Mostly affected are historical places full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with whom you've laid down a piece of street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oscar and the Grand Prix of Cannes 20 years ago.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these tokens mostly paid for the cinemas in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, and 6 in Naples, Naples, and Bologna.
The most affected regions include Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy is leading the lists, 81 are in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, "although it is useful that new structures also arise, but first of all, the preservation of the already existing, because closes a hall in the city, not all of its regular customers are ready for a multi-storey, instead of the old one.
And here, too, the lack of funds for the Trade Union Fund remains out of the question: the debt burden recorded by the state amounts to approximately 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not comply with existing laws.
To maintain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be needed.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to the fears surrounding the old cinemas, decided to protect it by an agreement between the community and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support the traditional cinemas as well as in the cinemas, and to support them.
Among the measures envisaged are also tax benefits for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public with regard to public transport: it will be allowed to drive in the restricted areas of the centre and also park at cheaper parking fees.
“It is a joyful initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “I hope that other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
But surely we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to align something against the superpower of the multiplex rooms, because in the end the audience of today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important theme for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to establish the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I have been with it for 10 years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; when I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside to not have to see the dusty posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The allegations by the attorney general of the Antimafia Authority of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in Mafia business, are grave.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior intermediary between the clan and the public administration, was also taken into custody, as was his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the clan's boss, had already been convicted of embezzlement in criminal associations of the mafia, at the time 10 million euros in defiance.
"Any kind of moral and legal norm is misleading," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations have decided to pay attorney Piromalli money for consulting activities."
“Thus, it was made possible for the mafia group to officially enter the town halls and to determine the policy of the public administration.”
The President of the Regional Committee of Calabria, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in his region "everything but an exception to encountering connections of local administrations and organized crime." "There are places where the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others, in which such connections are practically unmerciful.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to the police, the Piromalli clan was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and also at that time due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration – the local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, has been elected as the head of the Mid-Right coalition after the May 2006 elections.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He asked Deputy Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of having invented everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges explained in connection with the arrest warrant this morning that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request an amendment to the A3 project.
From a hearing in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case, the willingness has been shown to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – thus making the actions of the public administration identical to the interests of this clan.”
When the energy comes out of the waves, suddenly the big ones run up.
It is a non-defeating source of money that covers more than 70% of the planet’s surface, and it is only now that the world’s major energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at, and also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years; these studies have not coincidentally intensified significantly since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of marine energy was abandoned, but now environmental organizations and the rising price of oil are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world’s energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This is equivalent to doubling the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and tides were also added.
Giants in the attack.
The first company that now relies on marine energy is Enersis, who signed a contract to build a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are investing in marine energy production.
“Chevron is investigating these technologies,” said a spokesman for a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal, and is considering working with us.
This is about obtaining an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign that is not to be underestimated, e.g. considering that oil is still being promoted by the United States in Alaska, and President Bush recently launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; the details are also unknown, as observers speak of an increasing interest.
Even better-informed technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in its infancy, not least because the last doubts on the part of environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small size and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, it requires technologies with far greater impact on the environment.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The current is then sent to the coast via underwater lines.
Up to now, there are four planned facilities of this type, which are only waiting for state approval, and some of the energy gained could also be used for military installations.
However, Verdant Power already produces energy for a department store and parking lot using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotational motion.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential customers is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Acquisition Research, a particular interest immediately deserves the potential that is in the tides.
Although this is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are still better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also the waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is tidal energy that has led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states to invest $7.5 million already in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
