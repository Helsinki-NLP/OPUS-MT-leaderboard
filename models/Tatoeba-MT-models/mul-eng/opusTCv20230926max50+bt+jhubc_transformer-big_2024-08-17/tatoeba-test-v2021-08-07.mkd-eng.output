I'm just having a little fun.
I'm just kidding with you.
I'm just so proud of you.
I'm just starving.
I'm just surprised.
I'm just thinking out loud.
Just try to find him.
I'm just watching TV.
I'm running an account.
I'm a loner, you might say.
I'm cold.
I'm studying the piano.
I'm looking for them now.
I'll go get you.
My hair is falling out.
I'm blushing.
I'm making a movie.
I'm making a snowman.
I'm doing kaygan.
I'm married to Lori.
I'm married to Lori.

I'm not sure.
I don't like this.
I'm not digging your wells.
I'm not shy.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
I'm not even tired.
I'm not that warm either.
I can't find the equation.
I'm not a resident.
Tom didn't give me enough help.

I'm one of your students.
I'm only 18 years old.
I'm just here to help him.
I'm moving on right now.
I'm open to everything.
I motivated you.
I'm out of breath.
I won't be in town next week.
I moved into a new house last week, and yesterday I studied the library.
I've been through the shock.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I'm hungry for him.
I'm looking for him.
I'm pretty hungry!
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm pretty excited.
I'm trying.
I'm quiet.
I'm pretty proud of that.
I'm reading it now.
Now I'm ready for him.

I'm ready to make up for it.
I'm very confused.
I'm very good with animals.
I'm fired.

I'm still thinking about him.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm stronger than you.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
I'm learning French.
I'm studying music.
What a coward I am.
How retarded I am!
I need to help them.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam as soon as possible.
I'm sure I can find him.
I'm sure I can find them.
I'm sure I'm right.
I'm not sure that's what it was.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
I'm sure Tom will know what's best.
I'm sure Tom's gonna make it this way.
I'm sure Tom would really like to see you.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
I'm sure you'll make it.
I'm sure you'll find it clean.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.

I'm surprised to see you here.
I'm taking a break for lunch.
I'll take Tom for a walk.
I'm taking you to school.
I'm talking about him.
I'm getting dressed.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional taper.
I'm crazy.
I'm crazy.
He just wanted to meet Tom with me.
I've been kicked out.
I'm the one you want.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's jewels.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
I'm planning on going to Boston for Christmas.
I'm weak.
I'm 30 years old.
I'm 30 years old.
I'm three hours away.
Between me and Tom, it's over.
I'm fine.
I'm tired, I'm going to bed.
I'm sick of your constant complaints.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
I'm too low.
I'm too young to die.
I'm dead serious.
I'm terrified.
I'm giving my best.
I'm trying to avoid them.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you'll understand.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I'm trying to help Tom.
I'm trying to work.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm not armed.

I need to find a way to help them.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
I have to rest.
I have to go.
I need to talk to you.
I must have forgotten.
I'm very busy getting ready for the party.
I'm very busy here.
I'm very confused.
That's what I like about it.
I am looking forward to seeing the new version of Tatoeba.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunshine.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
I'm waiting for the green light to come on.
I'm waiting for the semaphore to change.
I'm walking with her.
It's hot.
I'm a tree.
I'm wet.
I'm willing to help.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
I am with the person I want to be with.
I work in Boston now.
I'm working on it.
I'm at work tomorrow.
I'm working.
I'm worried about your health.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna freak out.
I'm writing my will.
I'm your new partner.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
I did it.
They probably won't pay the money back.
In an emergency, what number should I call?
I was about to have a heart attack.

I have to understand.
I need some.
I need you a second.
I need you more than you can imagine.
I need you to find them.
I need you to open my door.
I never change my sleep schedule.
I had no doubt about that.
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
I didn't get an answer from her.
I didn't get an answer from them.
They never caught me.
I didn't hurt them at all.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
I haven't learned how to write.
I never lied to you.
I never look for my hands.
I didn't say I trusted him.
I never say anything, even though it annoys me.
I didn't touch it.
I didn't want that at all.
I never intended to deceive you.
I've never worn a suit.
I'm never gonna win.
You can cruise all year in Hawaii.
In many ways, men and women are very different.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Innocence is often a blessing, not a virtue.
I don't feel that way about you anymore.
To prepare the soil for planting, you need to dig it up.
In the forest, monkeys came down from the bushes.
In the middle of the city there is a fountain.
In the picture you can see bottles of various vegetable oils.
In what situations would you do that?
In what situations would you use it?
I respected their rules.
I offered to smoke his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
I talk to her often.
I've often heard him play the trumpet melody.
I play volleyball a lot.
I ski often.
I only have one minute.
I only exercise to look good when I'm naked.
I need to break your neck.
I owe Tom a lot.
I owe Tom for this.
I paid a penalty.
I'm planning on skipping lunch.
I'm planning to visit Tom in Boston next weekend.
I love dogs more than cats.
I prefer goat cheese more than cow cheese.
I prefer eggs from the underpants.
I prefer black.
I'd like to sit down more.
I would walk alone first.
I must sound funny.
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
I punched his box in the fork.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
I used the word "Alice" to describe it.
I suggested it.
I put three coffee spoons of sugar in your tea.
I opened my cupboard.
I gave up smoking, you know.
I gave up.
I'm raising cattle.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom's story.
I knew I hadn’t eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like what your hair looks like.
I really like the wine.
I really like your website a lot.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mom's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I really want to learn French.
It would be nice to be quiet.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the typist.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember when I met the Queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I cried one.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said maybe he'll come back.
I told you to open the door.
I said we were closed.
I agreed.
Is there anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Did something go wrong?
I saw a ghost.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw a game of cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister steal the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw it.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far away?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
Are the potatoes caloric?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you all busy?
Are you all happy?
Are they all having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
Is he eating an apple or a banana?
I shook my head.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I need to feel sorry for them.
I have to take her home.
I need to pack.
I have to go get dressed.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done that without you.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been cultured.
I should have checked.
I should've done that yesterday.
I should've known you'd be here.
I should have refused.
I showed her my room.
Is it cold outside?
Is it over?
Is it far from here?
Is Tatoeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is that true?
I got him a strawberry.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like an oath.
I slept in the tub.
I slept on the bus.
I cut the sandwich across.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages? No.
I smiled at you.
Isn't that exciting?
Is it not possible for Tom to do this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that too much?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this great?
I kind of like it.
I spent all day cleaning up the snow.
Is she a taxi driver?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I stared at the man.
I started seeing him.
I began to think about him.
I found something strange.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is it a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Is there such a word at all?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that enough?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what he did to them?
So is Tom there?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you came?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house finished?
Is the lake deep?
Is it paid for delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a prize?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it really a diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this exactly in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is yours a radio?
Is anybody sitting here?
Is it a free place?
Was that all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
Somehow I still can't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom aware?
Is Tom contributing?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Is Tom bothering you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
You're gonna talk to Tom?
Is Tom there alone?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a cypress in the dark.
I am learning the history of art.
I suddenly felt old.
I'm suffering from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on asking for a way out of the cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm starving you to death.
I suggest you send someone outside to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's how I doubted myself.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't have caught up with you if I hadn't burned you, but you'd be the last bucket of water.
I'm sweating every day.
Are you still working on the freezer?
Is your head full of straw?
I take this opportunity to thank her.
The Italian police are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisors about what items to take.
It all makes sense.
It looks aimless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
So it wasn't.
It's not possible!
They're for you now.
It was much more than I expected.
Never, but never, could not have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
That'd be good.
I didn't care.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That disappointed him.
It'd look good.
Don't bother me.
It's not gonna get any better.
It doesn't look very different.
It doesn’t matter what you don’t want to do; you have to do it anyway.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
Doesn't sound like anybody knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm studying English.
It's my taman.
That gave me an idea.
I have something to do.
It had to be done.
It must have been created from somewhere.
It depends on your decision.
It happened too soon.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's getting cold.
It has nothing to do with happiness.
It wasn't easy.
It has a sentimental value.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I might get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one like that.
I think I'm upset.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he is.
I think I love you.
I think I made a nice statement.
I think I write pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think it's possible to sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should look at Tom.
I think I should've asked for help.
I think I speak French very well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it would be best to stay here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it's time you left.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I'm wrong.
I think I might be able to help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive.
I think that's terrible.
I think it's brilliant.
I think it's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's soulless.
I think Tom's a conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's great.
I think Tom's tough.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's a villain.
I think Tom's fine.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's a petty man.
I think Tom's a snitch.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's nailed.
I think Tom's upset.
I think Tom's sensitive.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better not to drink water.
It's better not to go into a storm like this.
I think we'll join too.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're ready.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've had enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you're Spanish.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this on your own.
I think you can help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle for too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should end up alone with this.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought she had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but apparently I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought it was causing me.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom was retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
So we didn't agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
I think you're gonna have to work till the bush.
You didn’t like the award?
I thought you found another one.
I thought you lost your wristwatch.
Don't you hate him?
I thought he was tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you were only dating girls who were inferior to you.
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
So didn't you say you know how to swim?
So you didn't say you wanted to go with us?
I thought you'd better play chess than I did.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you'd live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I thought you weren't gonna be busy.
I thought you wouldn't like it, Tom.
It hurts so much here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the cap on the glass.
It is a multi-phase process.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
His first day at school.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical chance I'll finish the job in one day.
It's less humid today than it was yesterday.
It's not cool at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I'm paying.
It doesn't come in handy.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It’s starting to get in our heads that we can’t ignore nature.
It's warmer today than it was yesterday.
It is worth quoting a well-known passage of his essay.
It's written on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It's kind of wrong.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
Soon it will be Christmas.
It will be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked terrible.
It looked funny.
You seem right.
It looks very tasty.
It looks different.
It seems familiar to me.
It looks like an egg.
Looks like I drank too much yesterday, I'm worried about my head, I'm a bit of a moron.
Looks like these two are in a relationship again.
It seems these two have calmed down.
Looks like we'll have a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks good.
That's how I got close to Tom.
You're missing me.
I'm worried.
It can be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's already too late.
It may sound like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe he'll come back tonight.
It may seem strange.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It can be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It could rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have figured it out.
It must be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I told you my father died when I was thirteen.
I told you this was gonna be a nightmare.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I got together.
I got back on the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
I got my pants off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
It's probably not worth the wait.
He came back two days ago.
It resulted in great difficulties.
I tried to explain, but it didn't work.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend to be something I wasn’t.
I'm really sorry about that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to separate for you.
I'm trying not to break up.
He's about to turn back.
It's a classic.
It was a real disaster!
It is advisable to check if there may be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while you are taking the medicine you have been prescribed.
It's a children's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over.
It's all over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very strange.
It'll be over in a little while.
It's going to be midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
You're gonna have to leave her for a little while.
It's really fun.
It's seven o'clock.
It's eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you broke up.
It is about integrity.
That's a reasonable compromise.
That's a false trail.
It's a risky plan.
It's a shame the concrete isn't burning.
It's a quick walk.
It's just a job.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it'll take a lot of work.
They split him up.
It's just the macs that got me.
He's been back a week, up and down.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely hot.
You better not talk like that.
It's better to be alone.
It is better to be an optimist and to lie than to be a pessimist and to be right.
“It’s better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.” “Then why are you still alive?”
It's empty.
The sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one.
It's time for closure.
Study here.
It's common knowledge that you don't like Tom.
It's dark here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to judge his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier like this.
It's easier not to end up in prison than to run away.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
Looks like I misjudged it.
It looks like her style.
It seems to me that this is the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's bad to be a bird.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
To protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
He's dressed.
It's dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be beastly.
It'll get even colder.
It'll happen soon.
I'm glad to see you all again.
That's a good training.
It's okay.
It's getting better.
It's a lot of fun.
It happened before, too.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's hot here in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take too long.
I care what you think of Tom.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of a cell.
It's a safe place.
It's in excellent condition.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
The simple question is DE.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little forward.
It's locked.
It is made of leather.
I'll decide, Tom.
That's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring such gifts.
It's nice to feel like you need someone.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's noisy here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That's not a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not back.
It didn't happen that way.
It won’t be easy to do this without a lot of help.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's nothing terrible.
It's not just guessing.
It's not usually a pen.
There is not enough light to read.
It's not like we're doing something.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
Don't surprise me.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It's not up to you.
It doesn’t happen very often that someone buys a hat for a thousand dollars.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a printing error.
It is obvious to everyone that he is in love.
It is only a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
That sounds really strong.
That sounds very good.
Our job is to help them.
It's white through.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
It's probably still there.
It's probably still available.
It's suffocating.
It's actually quite common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
Tom may not be able to help us at all.
It's simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really bad.
It's a real shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's the law!
It's so obvious we don't need proof.
It's starting to darken.
It's still dark outside.
It's still on sale.
It's still working.
It still doesn't work.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It's strange how people in the tropics eat spicy food like curry.
It's stuck.
His face was as flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best steak I've ever tasted.
It's a spider's cascade.
I'm so scared, I'm so scared.
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It is too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
It's very subtle.
It's bullshit.
It's all wrong.
He can't stand the heat.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom urgently.
He's going to relax a lot.
It's very simple to understand.
It's warm in here.
I don't care.
There's wind.
It's a job.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
On the water, it only takes three minutes to boil.
It lasted all night.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would take.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Looks like you're an unexpected talker.
I turned on the fan and directed it towards the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I rejected Tom.
It was a great pleasure to be asked to speak.
It was so beautiful.
That was the shame.
It was midnight.
It was an arena day.
It was a great series.
That was all my idea.
It was all right here.
It was all so easy.
It was an amazing night.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It was an honor.
It was an offer I couldn’t refuse.
It was a pleasure to spend the night with a smart, witty and beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
It was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a great day.
It was a beautiful evening.
Such behavior was childish on his part.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
That was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
It was fun yesterday.
It's been a night.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been proven that fleas that live on dogs jump higher than those that live on cats.
It was so glorious.
It was pretty funny.
It was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He was smoking a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that's attached to the jacket.
It was Tom.
It was too little.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was incomprehensible.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very clumsy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Better.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be all right.
It won't be enough.
I'm not gonna be alone here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
They won't help lies.
It's not gonna help you.
It's working fine.
It would be very normal for you to be mad at Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I can explain everything to you.
I really need you.
I used to watch you.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I already packed up.

Wouldn't it be a shame?
Wouldn't you start to comb your hair from that?

Can you check those out?
Can you get Tom a message?
Could you take out the cigarette?
Would you put this in the car for me?
Can you speak up?
Would you participate in this event?
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Oh, my God, it's really late.
Honey, look at this.
Oh, that's great.
Oh, my God!
Write down your date of birth.
Write to Tom.
If he did, he'd get better... when the warts give birth to grapes.
Yeah, get me some porridge.
Yeah, anyway.
Yeah, I said that, but I wasn't right.
Yes, my angel.
Yeah, and?
Yeah, right?
Yesterday I made a cake with mushrooms.

You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
You can count on us.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.

You better go help him.
You better go.
You better let me do that.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
You deserved better.
You would do the same in my place.
He's done a bad job.
You did a great job.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
Didn't you know Tom was a coward?
You didn't listen.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
You didn't tell me it was wrong.
You told Tom about it, right?
You've already done that.
He gave everything of himself.
You don't have to like everything.
You don't even like fish.
They got them, didn't they?
You don't have a random key?
You don't know how long.
You don't have to be abnormal to work here.
You know, my coward.
You don't know anything.
Dream that you know.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
You don't have to be present for this.
You don't have to go.
There's no need to panic.
You don't have to wear anything fancy.
You don’t have to write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't understand business.
You don’t want to do something that will remind them that you’re not really big enough to be here.

You haven't seen one, have you?
You haven't solved the problem, have you?
You have a really good manuscript.
Make your hands soft.

Don't get involved in this.
Children, you're here to stay.
You knew, didn't you?
You know I'd do anything for your red eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you think.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you have to listen to him.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're studying fast.
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.

That's what you're gonna have to ask.
You're going to have to study harmfully next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.

He gave a word.
You're disturbing me.
Maybe you'll be needed.
You can go anywhere.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
You can sleep here.
It wouldn't be a bad thing to slow down.
You met my sister, right?

We only have one life.
One is life.
You need to create a habit of brushing your teeth after every meal.
You should go to the dentist.
You don't owe me anything.
You pay me very well.
You've made a good choice.
You probably think I'm an ass.
It went red.
He ran as fast as he could.
You're burning your car.
You're burning your car.
Your complaints bothered me.
Your transgressions have defiled the graves of your ancestors.

You're below his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not that terrible.
You're not suggesting that we give Tom all the money, are you?

You're lying, Tom.
The eyebrows look weird to you.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smells like spring.
You squeeze too much when you shake hands.
Your health is very important to me, so why don't you go to the doctor?
Your house is very beautiful.

That's what I said an hour ago.
You told me to call anytime.
You said we'd never catch her.
You said you'd help.
You said you'd text me tonight, but you lied to me, obviously.
You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
I think you already know the answer.
You look like you're studying.
You've got an infection.
It's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
Do you share his interest in the book?

You need to sleep well.
You should give him some space.

You've got your butt kicked.
You're so pretty.
You really talk a lot.
You talk too much about Boston.
You think it's weird just because it's not white.
Traitor!
You two are very sweet together.
It used to be so much fun.
He used to love Boston.
You're back.
They're drunk.
You've experienced a traffic jam, but you'll be fine.

It was of great benefit to us.
You're right from the beginning.
You made white again!
You bought something for Mary.
You beat me.
He beat them.
You've done so much.
You scared her.
Exaggerating her!

I promise you.
You have now, don't you?
You have to let me pass on a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
He's unlucky, Tom.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
You've been delaying this for too long, and you've got tonight to finish it!
You've seen what I can do.
You were amazing.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
He was lucky to have survived the attack.
You're wrong.
It's not like you were wrong.
Tom was right.
He was driving fast.
It was great.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
He was very brave.
He wasn't right about the picture.
You will do as I command you.
You'll find your toys and books.
You won't need it.
You're not gonna make it.
You won't win.
You're cutting too much for him.
I don't want you to be late.
Yeah, I'm angry.
