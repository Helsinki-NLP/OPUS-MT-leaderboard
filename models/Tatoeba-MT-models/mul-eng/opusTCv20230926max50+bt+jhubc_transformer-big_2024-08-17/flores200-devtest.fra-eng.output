The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the USOC (U.S. Olympic Committee) that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served. This can be done by moving forward and rather by making significant changes within our organization, as well as by making changes in our organization.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse of the proportion described so courageously by Larry Nassar's survivors was able to go unnoticed for so long and adopt any necessary and appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and responsible environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown chestnut on the top and pale or carotenoid in color on the bottom.
This discovery also makes it possible to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, which is called rachis, but they do show other features specific to the feathers – beards and beards – researchers have deduced that rachis was probably a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for regulating or displaying temperature. Researchers have suggested that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the duvet of a pigeon.
Scientists say this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young one.
A car caught exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

They found that the Sun worked according to the same basic principles as the other stars. The activity of all the stars in the system is determined by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is linked to the plasma flow.
As for magnetic inversions, the smaller the number of Rossbys, the less active the star.

The work was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the black matter of the galaxy and the black matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a traction on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that black matter affects other black matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the black matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered multidrug resistant tuberculosis (TB-MR) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview, he stated that the new mutation was ""very disturbing and alarming due to the very high mortality rate""."
Some patients reportedly contracted the virus at the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, and at least two of them were hospital staff.
Over a period of one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of TB-UR in the entire group of people with tuberculosis seems still low; 6,000 people out of a total of 330,000 were infected at some point in South Africa.

Several million vials of encephalitis vaccine have also been promised by the government, which will help prepare health agencies for next year.
Vaccine delivery plans in the historically most affected areas this year have been delayed due to lack of funds and low priority given to these diseases compared to others.

“They are cooler than the surrounding surface by day and warmer at night.”
“Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of the planet’s large caves that maintain a constant temperature, but they look like they are deep holes in the earth,” said Glen Cushing, a member of the USGS (American Center for Geological Survey, Arizona) and staff member of the U.S. Geological Survey.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put in a envelope a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the officers have verified his identity, the elector throws the envelope into the urn and signs his elector card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations in a fairly strict manner.
Since 1988, ballots must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelope is present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelope is added, except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision, according to specific procedures.

Edgar Veguilla was injured in the arm and jaw while Kristoffer Schneider had to undergo reconstructive surgery for his face.
Uka's weapon was razed as she was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers from a slender pain, no longer sees a single eye, lost part of his skull, and his face was reconstructed from titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from a USAF base in his country.
Apart from the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in two individual races at the Championships.
She first participated in the slalom, where she won a "did not finish" (DNF) during her first race. 36 of the 116 competitors achieved the same result in this race.
His other race, the giant slalom, allowed him to finish in tenth place in the women’s group sitting with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes less than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, first arrived, and 1:09.02 minutes less than the Hungarian Gy<0xC3><0xB6>ngyi Dani, ninth arrived.
In the women's ski sitting category, four skiers failed to finish their course; in the case of the giant slalom, 45 skiers out of a total of 117 in this race failed to qualify.
The police of Madhya Pradesh have found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: “We arrested five people for raping the Swiss national, and we recovered her phone and laptop.”
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, a police commissioner, said the accused had their face hidden when they appeared before the court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit her, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily blocked to allow emergency services to extract the driver from the Red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of his son by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody pending her examination and trial, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised as her portrait has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that “journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they post photos, etc. of suspects.”
The Crown Prosecutor's office, which is in charge of all the prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of existing borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees for a period of five years.
The shooters of the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was controlled and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting park and heritage conservation officer at the NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first shooting campaign were properly trained and trained on security orders.
Martelly joined a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (PEC) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a set of measures to engage the country on the path to new elections.
This commission was Martelly’s response to the vast protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called “non-serious.”
The ministry responded by calling it "really regrettable" the postponement of the report by Apple.
The earthquake struck the Mariannes at 7 p.m. local time (21 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damage had been reported in the country.
In addition, the Tsunami Warning Center in the Pacific said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot with his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the death of at least six of them has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father’s footsteps and embarked on a medical career.
He was trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births during his free time.
Her research has shown that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the baby’s pulmonary maturation.
The Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or “black boxes”) on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: “Muna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died the night of two months. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... or even more... I love her and she's going to miss me... I hope she's in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election revealed that Australia’s number of opponents to the transformation into a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was to swim at 100 m and 200 m free swimming and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He was not able to take the necessary medications to overcome his pain, these being prohibited within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest prime number known to date.
Several people have verified the discovery using various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and more particularly how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumours “political chatter and nonsense.”
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow devices to fly over shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite technologies, not on ground-based radar systems previously used, allowing air controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transportation is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and relay parks are not available on the ground.
Fear of the lack of transport has led to the possibility that the match could be played indoors, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Gal<0xC3><0xA1>pagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process was thought to be much longer, following the reproduction between an endemic Darwinian, Geospiza fortis, and the conmigrian, geospiro to bec.
We can shape gold in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces
It can be pulled in fine wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or laminated in sheets.
It can be made very fine, and glued to another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is what is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice of cabbage changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean and wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a water chase in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public baths where men and women sat side by side.
When you call a person who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere deforms part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The biggest advantage it has brought us is that it has made transportation much easier and faster.
This brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are more medium-sized felines that eat also medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other rabbits.
In addition, there are many small cats (including companion cats at large) that eat small prey, much more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task dedicated to each feline, preventing it from entering into competition with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called mice.
The mussels are composed of one to three related adult males, as well as about thirty females and lions.
Women are usually very close to each other, their family being made up of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Lions’ troops act as minions of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other great felines) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficult), swim, jump from great distances and treat with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (Panthera genus) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones able to roar.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the broad roar of the lion, but rather a phrase whose words would be shouts and roars.
Ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, the ocelots track and find the animals to be eaten (scented) by the smell, re-inflating their path on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and also move very stealthily. Ocelots trace their prey by basking in their environment before throwing themselves on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example, if it moves above a chain of mountains or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return to a different place behind it),
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new features or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it used to need.
The original population has not changed at all, it always needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process "speciation", which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and our plant-based clothing. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasur was the superpredator of the time, he feared nothing but the other mosasurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth like razor blades, as well as an additional set of teeth in the palace, so that everything that crossed his path could not escape.
We are not sure, but he may have had the tongue pierced. His diet consisted of turtles, big fish, other mossaurus, and he may even have been cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was no size against him.
Although the Romans consumed the food we know, they ate some strange or unusual feast dishes, including sangliers, peacocks, snails as well as loir, a sort of ronger.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman were eating their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets together where they were resting on the side while they were eating their meals.
Roman meals of antiquity could not include these foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered the home of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could access.
Some pyramidal towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was in the open air.
The women were cooking in the yard; the shops were just open counters overlooking the street; the houses were built of stone.
Since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, wood was extremely expensive.
In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland to murder that he found Greenland — and named it so — by traveling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Although each country is “Scandinavian”, there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie Benjamin Gates and the Treasure of the Templars, you might think that a treasure map was drawn behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
At the back of the Declaration of Independence, one could read the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, in reverse.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (which measures about 29 inches three quarters of 24 inches) was stored rolled.
It is therefore likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
Day J's landing and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French of Vichy, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting it.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Forces de la France Libre had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by an important group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means civil and which is related to the Latin words "civil", which means citizen, and "citizens", which means big city or city-state and which also indicates, in some way, the size of the society to which it refers.
The cities-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — Congress being its only component — under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all of its acts.
It also did not have the power to derogate from tax laws or customs duties between States.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all States before they could be amended and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national team, is the second most qualified team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, scrimmage, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One.
Winter sports are the most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that make up it, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipel".
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing by made mention of it under the name of Ilha Formosa, or “beautiful island”.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after his defeat during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which he ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
The Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the three-window room.
Most of the adjacent buildings of the complex have been rebuilt to provide tourists with a better overview of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of the Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the digital camera’s photographic sensor format.
The 35 mm format is actually, and it is quite disconcerting, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
It is therefore said that the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest of integer ratios) is 3:2.
Many common formats (family of APS formats, for example) are equal to or approaching this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, highly ill-treated and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that arouses dynamism while offering image protection.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into third parties vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was called into question.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked European states to each other despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the King to the Roturier.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church’s monetary funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for more than 1,000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to wonder if this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain set up a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mines international waters in order to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic only triggered a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction in the face of its boundless undersea war.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the war during the First World War, the nations wished to avoid such a situation recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred in his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his director in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different eras; every step of China or every family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known of these periods is the time of the Three Kingdoms which took place for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place among many members of the nobility who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms have been one of the bloodiest times in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people have died in battle to sit on the throne of the grand palace of XI'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Thus, after the Revolution, the trades were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and the most talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, because the ranking of the armies is no longer based on the class, but on the caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working classes from other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the scope of this worldly life; he used to frequent a cave that became famous as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very vivid picture of the spiritual slopes of Muhammad.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it at all, even if you know it exists. When you enter the cave, you're completely isolated.
Above, nothing can be contemplated except the bright and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, one can only see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Gizeh Necropolis", in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khéops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his women as well as his family members.
The “push” symbol resembles a V and the “pull” symbol resembles a staple or square whose lower side is missing.
The top means you need to start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you need to start with the rise (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow to the top usually produces a softer sound, while a bow to the bottom is stronger and more pronounced.
Do not hesitate to register your own brands on the pencil, but do not forget that the printed archetypes are for a musical reason, and therefore generally must be respected.
On 6 October 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king’s sister, Madame Elizabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of merchants.
In a carriage, they return to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, a crowd member shook the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interests of bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of order.
These events took place in the period generally considered the High Middle Ages – period of history in Europe from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological advancement or technological imperative to a strict sense that the destiny of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place in a process far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are conditioned intrinsically rather than socially.
For example, it could be said that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive car ownership also leads to a greater impact of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat body injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture related to this geography would have emerged; these, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to the laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as that of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders were responsible for such gifts as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style experienced its peak between the 10th–11th century and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the means of communication, Western modes could accuse a delay of 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for the closure of clothes.
Sustained agriculture is an agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Livestock farming is a simple, often biological system, using preserved seeds originating in the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and/or gender of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often report their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or voluntary abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered "ferocious" or wild. Some wild children were imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by the parents of a serious intellectual or physical disability that the child suffered.
Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or fled.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When fully raised by non-human species, wild children exhibit behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a learning method but more a way to help learners who discover new teaching such as the use of a new program or the start of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little trombone man from Microsoft Office is one too.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to question, guide and explain procedures that could have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster families for very diverse reasons ranging from neglect to mistreatment, through extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but that is the case.
We perceive the family placement system as a safety zone for these children.
Our host family placement system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The host family placement is supposed to provide all the necessities that were missing in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and gratification.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are considered to be major factors in promoting the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “continuous relationships” were also identified as new motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public’s reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President’s Speech, pointed out how people who cannot understand the speech due to brain injuries are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
20th century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the reserve of the expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alter the variations between the two basins for each generation.
In savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in the leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
By contrast, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all the vital amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn’t be surprised if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” in the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your sleep period and slowing down shortly after (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively silent awakening, in order to make you regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids before you go to sleep (especially water or tea, known to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is opposed to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is present, and each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras activated, and the awakening consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their various systems, methods and cultures ended the agreement between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the old allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see real clashes, through replacement armies, on battlefields in Africa as well as in Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retire and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost from day to day, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after they invaded the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga or the soviet pact.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and property, while interfering with your enemy’s ability to move his people and property.
One of the most notable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, and the Americans were trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean with soldiers and equipment to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by herders who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known term shepherds.
The "wagonways" were built in England in the 16th century.
Although the lanes for wagons were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
The cruisers were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place, however, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they were fitted with an iron band on top.
This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of cars.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails made their appearance.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo erectus ("right man").
Their predecessors, the australopitheques, did not walk as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even militate in order to alleviate the suffering ahead.
In many cases, this is symptomatic treatment, however, if we don’t want only a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and that the problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and extravagant way of life of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Court of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had him read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap sheets, which are still known to exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs have survived and are still alive, and they are called birds.
Few people consider them dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs covered with scales and fitted with claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use the computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic drugs or household chemicals.
Consult the label to know the instructions for first aid specific to this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects very suitable for parasitic humans.
The reducers, like bed bugs, are nidicole, that is, adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of plaque sclerosis (SEP), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Platelet sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple can very well appreciate that it is not in their interest, nor in the child's interest, to take care of a baby's education.
These couples may choose to make an adoption project for their baby.
As part of an adoption, biological parents end their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, it is not the only experiment, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but that also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle’s views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of the Greek, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue an operating cycle for a certain period, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to label either phage DNA with a radioactive phosphorus, or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people who wish to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially wildlife and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem are examples of on-site activities.
For example, one can go to see, photograph and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small country towns by car to go to their workplace and cross other people who will work in the countryside they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on particular cars and supports it.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they go down on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
The traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and particular vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate manner.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to more easily escape their enemies and to find food and companions more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a greater number of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can not fold their wings are dragon flies and ephemerals.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, covering more than eight times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
No less than 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, collecting water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Ancient Empire, the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed by their size and technical excellence in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants, the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and its official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of Vatican City are all Catholic.
Since ancient times, peoples are familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, as they are found in nature in raw form and are fairly simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it was the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although it also issued the theory that they are transformed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys are also found which include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new writing modes has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to more rare uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to get close to a screen size.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty arrives.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
It's like climbing a hill on a heavy cart, splitting the core again, and releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break down with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible face and 100 km on the hidden face.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is finer. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding out what makes people feel good or are attracted to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues, one of the ends of the spectrum being to try to stay “the good boyfriend” (or the good girlfriend).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, carrying out assessments, entrusting responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unfamiliar individual who feels that he/she must change everything the group has created so far and do things their way.
After all, the manager is responsible for the team’s success and failure.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The “invisible team” is the management team to which each of the members reports, setting the standards for each of them.
Why would an organization want to impose itself on the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives related to the implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in an organization’s functional services, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization is innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus reducing the field of research and making it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, injuries, tumors, and brain trauma affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of the computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The research in artificial intelligence is aimed at automation by task machines requiring an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as the recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to the problems of daily life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been outlined in several home computer software and video games.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not conceivable.
The solution is brought by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can watch the ancient objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a superb work of art while remaining seated with their class.
Practically participating in an excursion is also a great way to think about a trip and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often try to experience the blog with a neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually makes the situation evolve.
As students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging “obliges students to better understand the world around them.” The need to arouse the public’s interest encourages students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When used properly, ""blogs can enable students to strengthen their analytical abilities and critical thinking: by actively responding to online content, they can compare their opinions to those of others and expose their own views on very specific topics" (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada’s charming bilingual capital and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada’s past and present.
To the south you will find the Niagara Falls and to the north, the Muskoka region and its surroundings which have a virgin natural beauty.
All these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent on its own, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known to be luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam into the lands and this religion spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, at a time when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape road that connects Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended for any woman who travels to say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear an alliance (which should not seem too valuable).
Women need to realize that some cultural differences can lead to behaviors that they consider to be harassment; indeed, it is common for them to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing men’s advancements, and don’t be afraid to keep up (cultural differences or not, that doesn’t mean it’s acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sinners in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after destroying it had rebuilt it and renamed it Casa Branca, eventually abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading counters there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tahini, pottery, Moroccan items, nargils and bibelotes of all kinds, but that’s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located at the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city’s streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma must be researched to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for hiking trails of the mountains among the least expensive in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (moto taxi) to travel to Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a small race.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, “Tombuccio” has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" on PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the cities of the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located northeast of South Africa and runs along the Mozambique border to the east, from Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km2, this is divided into 14 ecozones, each housing a specific fauna.
It is one of the most well-known amusement parks in South Africa and is considered to be the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation rights for the park.
It may be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card that gives access to some South African parks, as well as all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main center of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that draws Hong Kong’s horizon has been compared to a glittering bar chart, which is revealed by reflection in the waters of Victoria’s harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and join the Kowloon seafront in front.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the highlands of the north bank.
This is where the British colonists invested, so it seems to me to be a good starting point if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest belt of coastal mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/marecage areas.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, where you can find about 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the interdistrict bus station (located on the other bank) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakarta/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often complete, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese caboteurs, who are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a hub bridge that overlooks the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, the date on which Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
Guaran<0xC3><0xAD> were the largest indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence farming.
Other indigenous tribes that populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycur<0xC3><0xBA> or the Payagua, survived mainly through fishing, hunting, or harvesting.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as “the giant province of India”, was born out of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its Aboriginal character and identity.
Argentina is known to have one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo courts of Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas.
In addition, tournaments and smaller matches are sometimes organized here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and places where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only island bank located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a currency commonly accepted throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted.
On the neighboring islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even though it may be British and US currencies. Talk to the owners in advance in order to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Malouines outside the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is located in the south of Ecuador, the winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to the summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical area and summer temperatures exceeding 30 <0xC2><0xB0>C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it’s colder than the thermometer says.
There are really no “rainy” and “dry” seasons: the rainfall is almost constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are nevertheless wild species; please do not feed them or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, it is necessary to stand at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may appear, the bison, the elan, the original, the bear and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, know that the smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid transporting or cooking fragrant foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a tragically famous naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally held in the city, during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, as Auckland is on horseback on two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and allow you to swim safely, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburb of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very frequented by families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming there is safe.
The main local beer is the "Number One", a fairly ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the "Manta".
There are plenty of French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink local tap water safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "cream coffee" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all the signs and pay special attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, in the north of 1770, box jellyfish arrive near the beaches and estuaries of rivers, which can also sometimes be seen outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most of them are afraid of humans and would get away with it.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat is in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
The reservation in advance gives the traveler peace of mind to know that he will have a place to sleep once he has arrived at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, airport/airport shuttle service, or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They may also withhold the reservation for you if you need time to reflect on the offer or provide you with other documents necessary for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any change or request must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider this to be an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the music event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed camping area.
Remember that even if the musical shows are finished on the main stages, other musical shows can continue until late into the night at other venues of the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noise at the level of the most exposed cabins.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by customers. There are rarely windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of dishes, drinks and entertainment in order to maintain the good mood of the guests and to keep them in place.
On some sites, it is the premises that offer free alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, drinking alters the judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone travelling by car at high latitudes or crossing the mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice or glacial temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can’t drive as if you were on the bare asphalt.
During the blizzards, it can fall in very little time enough snow to block you.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfall or powder or by condensation or ice on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most striking moment for many visitors.
In the current language, the term “safari” refers to a trip to the African land, and especially to the savannah, with the aim of attending the spectacle of capturing wild animals in their midst.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and standard equipment makes it possible to observe them well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you’ll see them better with twins.
A walking safari (also called a “walking bush”, “footing safari” or “footing”) consists of hiking for either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, after hosting the 1964 Games.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement announcement, you may be faced with a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, the date on which the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing about 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have an iron and a ironing board that can be borrowed, even if there are no rooms in the rooms, which are easy to dry.

In some localities it is enough to boil water for a minute; in others it is necessary to do it for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that they do not know in their area of origin.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation, or, in the most severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some localities, duty-free shops offer an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers to countries where taxes are high can sometimes make considerable savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated terrains in the hinterland.
If you don’t have the habit of driving on country roads, keep your mind open: steep slopes, narrow lanes and narrow curves predominate.
The speed limits displayed are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict compliance is even more important than before.
On the other hand, mobile service is surprisingly much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common: apples are cooked and cooked in pastries all year round, while cherries and plums point the tip of their nose in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often marry particularly well with a cup of tight coffee.

Indonesia has 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines present throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualification, it tends to designate foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavors that Javanese prefer being peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stilts are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: indeed, the user’s feet can stay stuck there.
If a rider is projected from a horse, but has a foot taken in the trunk, it could be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth and rather narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially the English, have safety bars that allow a tripod to fall off the saddle if it is pulled back by a horseman who falls.
Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley – The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many different large walls and granite cliffs.
From the top of the peaks, the panoramas of the mountains are impressive, and mountaineers from all over the world are constantly discovering new paths that can be reached on the slopes, where the possibilities are unlimited.
Winter downhill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sledging to clear a snowy track with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many aficionados, sometimes called "ski bums", who organize their entire vacation depending on the ski in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings showing skiers date back to some 5,000 years BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century; the first recreational ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking.
This is similar to alpine hiking skiing, as well as mountaineering, without generally incorporating these activities, which are practiced on rugged terrain and require the use of much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to travel a little longer distances than on foot – but you will very rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on ski slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. In classical circumstances, travelling through several countries involves having to carry out several visa applications and undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions a bit like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the borders without passing through the passport checkpoints.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each of the member countries of the space, which saves time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition to determine whether a manufactured object is an antiquity. Some tax agencies define assets over 100 years old as antiquities.
The criteria vary according to where one is located; in some parts of the world, as in North America, the age limit may be lower than that in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be considered antiques, even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Renal farming is an important means of subsistence among the Sami and the culture that surrounds this trade is of great importance for many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer farming, they lived on fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using the reindeer primarily as sledding animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people practice modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.

Travelers who have had a hard time adapting to the new culture sometimes have a lot of difficulty adapting to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some habits of your original culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers to a new country have to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers and travelers returning home.

The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: the island of Livingston and Deception, where the caldera flooded with a volcano still active offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern part of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reappear to form the 360-km-long Ellsworth Mountain Range and cross the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinelle chain, includes the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson massif, which peaks at 4892 m.
In remote locations, without a cellular telephone network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone does not usually replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have an unobstructed view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure boats, as well as shipments that have remote data transmission and telephony needs.
Your local phone operator should be able to tell you more about the connection to this service.
Those who plan a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them choose this possibility.
This formula is particularly appreciated by young people who leave school, as it allows them to take a year off before college, without compromising their studies.
Often, having followed sabbatical year courses abroad can actually give you a better chance of doing graduate studies in your country.
As a general rule, registration fees must be paid to follow these educational programs.
Finland is a destination of choice for pleasure navigation. The “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don’t necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are actually large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing pleasure is a national pastime in Finland, on the basis of a boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, this is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises are characterized by an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only travel on land with cruise tours, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, in Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see by looking at the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the sea edge and no visit of this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
Don’t be ashamed of it: it’s no different from the personal fears and fears that many people experience when it comes to other things.
For some, understanding something about the operation of airplanes and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not having control.
Transport companies are well paid to carry out rapid deliveries. Often, as part of an urgent repair, the issue of deadlines is crucial for the documents, goods or spare parts that relate to them.
On some roads, big companies have their own planes, but on other roads and for small businesses, there was a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on some routes, it would have taken days to pass the unloading and customs.
The only way to make it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Air regulations will not allow them to send a baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you intervene.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to spend a large sum of money for this privilege (or better yet, to ask your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for the business class, and eleven times for the first class!
In general, it is unnecessary to seek discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of travelers who are willing to pay very dearly for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their rates on a case-by-case basis.
