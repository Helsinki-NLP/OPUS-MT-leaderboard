Welsh MPs are worried that they will “look like Muppets”
Some of the members of the Assembly (AM) were surprised by the proposal so that they could be called members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP) in the future.
This was due to plans for the council to be renamed to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the House of Representatives from all political spectrums are concerned that they may become the subject of a report.
A Sabor MP from the Labour Party said his group was concerned that the name “matches with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside of Wales: on the Welsh twp means stupid, and pwp means pigeon.
The Parliamentary representative from the Party of Wales (Plaid Cymru) said that the group as a whole was "unsatisfactory" and proposed alternative solutions.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" to changing the name, but that the MWP in the speech could quickly turn into Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Sabor Committee, which is currently preparing the name change bill, said: "Of course the final decision on how Sabor MPs will be entitled to be on their own."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that found broad support for changing the names of the councils in the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to what the members of the council will be called, the Committee was inclined to call "members of the Grand Parliament" or MWPs, but the MWP option received the greatest support during the public consultation.
The House of Representatives is proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach a consensus could lead to a headache for House Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the council, including rules on disqualification of council representatives and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, the House of Representatives will have a decisive vote on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonia to hold a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether they want to change the name of their country to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a possession of Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the initiation of the process of its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would not accept the referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the change of name is simply the price that needs to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells have been silenced as churches in Harlem fight for survival
“The older people I spoke to said that in the past there could be a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
“There’s no one else today.”
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“People today are socializing in a different way,” he said.
“Bars no longer represent the living quarters where people regularly stay.”
When it comes to churches, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think and “early or later it will find itself again at the beginning.”
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where people will live who will not help the remaining churches in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “so the day will come faster when those churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that the residents who enter those apartments will become members of those churches.”
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved in the 1930s.
The Black Congregation, which maintained worship nearby, took over ownership of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson and a boycott of merchants on a small 125th street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed the hiring or promotion of blacks.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but as the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a series of bells, the so-called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played on the carillon in July used a second name: "cultural goods" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who has been playing on a larger carillon at Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What is taking place in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and builders of construction works, some of which were brought to the church by lay leaders and others by episcopal dioceses.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish made up of laika, wrote to the diocese in July due to concerns that the diocese would "try to transfer costs" to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in the engagement of architects and builders of the construction works sent by the sections.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old Marine Dog Injured During Diving for Lungs in California
According to an official statement on Saturday, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for a lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster hunting season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends about an hour and a half Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then took the group to the scene of the attack to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was an excitement about the caught lobster, but then realized that he was shouting “He bites me!
He bites me!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy he noticed that his entire key bone had been shattered.
“I made sure everyone came out of the water: ‘There’s a sea dog in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of marine dog responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue team captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a sea dog had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous type of sea dog.
Giles added that the victim suffered a traumatic injury to the upper part of the body.
Authorities have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for investigation and safety of the swimmers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sea dogs in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury’s is becoming a competition for chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic countertops in the style of department stores and engaging specialized retailers.
As part of a large entry into the UK beauty market worth GBP 2.8 billion, which continues to grow in parallel with the decline in sales of clothing and home equipment, larger cosmetic counters will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expanded to additional stores next year if the next year comes.
Investing in cosmetic products is one of the ways that supermarkets try to take advantage of the shelf space that was once intended for televisions, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s representatives said they would double the size of the range of cosmetic products to 3,000 products, including for the first time and brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing assortment of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with areas for certain brands similar to stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of boutique decorative cosmetics, so most products will be suitable for vegans, which is what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfume retailer will trially use concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first one opened last week in Croydon in South London and the second one opened at Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and returning to everyday shopping for small amounts of food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to work harder to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the outlet will look more like a grocery store as the supermarket chain tries to resist favorable stores such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s introduced Argos outlets to hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitats departments, because two years ago, it bought both chains, which it claims prompted the sale of live food and made those acquisitions more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to refresh its departments of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products has not been successful.
Sainsbury’s entered into a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but this ended in a dispute over the distribution of pharmacy revenue in its supermarkets.
The new strategy followed after Sainsbury’s sold his pharmaceutical business to 281 store Celesius, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, three years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan by listing a range of luxury skin care products in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to provide our customers with a more comfortable environment.
We also invested in the special training of a colleague who will be at the hands of customers and give them advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and available location means that we are now an attractive destination for purchasing cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in old shopping habits."
Peter Jones is ‘wrong’ after Holly Willoughby quits <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract
Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones left to “cook out of anger” after TV host Holly Willoughby gave up a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his brand to focus on her new deals with the Marks & Spencer and ITV chain
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of homewear and fashion accessories Truly.
Their brand is compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The show's host, This Morning (37), announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragon’s Day show Peter Jones to cook out of anger by pulling out of a profitable joint venture at the last minute to focus on her own new great deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "crazy" when a golden girl on television during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million meant that she no longer had enough time to devote to their business.
This job was compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double Willoughby's wealth estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
This was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would secure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to retire surprised everyone involved in the job.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to the start of the entire line.
At Marlow's headquarters, the warehouse is full of goods that are ready for sale."
Experts believe that due to the departure of the show's host, This Morning, one of the stars in the UK in which it is most profitable to invest, the company could suffer millions of losses due to the large funds invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and blankets.
And that could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby's mother and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as CEO in March.
Couples spend the holidays together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as head of ITV's I'm a Celebrity Show.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We don’t want to comment on his business activities.”
Tough negotiations, and then we fell in love
He joked at the criticism he would get in the papers for comments that some might consider “unworthy of the president” and for having such a positive attitude towards North Korea’s leader.
“Why did President Trump give so many concessions?”
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news leader.
“I didn’t make any concessions.”
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But the denuclearization talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore on Saturday, North Korea's chief diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North had not noticed the "appropriate response" from the United States to North Korea's disarmament activities.
He noted that instead, the U.S. has still not lifted sanctions aimed at further pressure.
In his speech at the meeting, Trump took a much more optimistic stance.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We are at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – a break in missile launches, help free the hostages and return the remaining U.S. troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It’s so easy to act as president, but instead of 10,000 people waiting in front of this crowded arena to enter, we’d have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd of people right in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population is displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear about not seeking international assistance, so it’s all a bit problematic,” Ms. Sumbang said.
Although the Save the Children organization is a team that will travel to Palo, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the Office for National Disasters, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palua to see if international agencies would be allowed to engage in efforts to provide assistance.
Considering the constant underscoring of the soil in Indonesia, this country is still sadly unprepared to bear with the wrath of nature.
Although shelters in the case of a tsunami were built in Aceh, this is not something that is common on other parts of the coastline.
The absence of a warning siren at the Pau tsunami, although the warning was in force, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And at the best time travel between numerous Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to take care of the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Pal, but it takes him at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's decayed structure was the basis of President Joko Widodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Yokohama is struggling with a lack of financial resources, and next year new elections are being held.
Joko is also faced with the pressure of remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fight in the streets of mosques, arches and shootings and other primitive weapons.
See also: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge killed by goal to equalise against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal with a score of 1:0 for Chelsea.
He shifted the ball to his left foot before shooting it at the opposite tripod.
The ball flew high above the goal to the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually escaped Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped towards her and entered the net.
“It was a challenge to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to get as close as possible to the goal, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once. I didn’t think too much about it and I just shot.”
Chelsea led by 1-0 in the semi-finals after beating Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the ball back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> during that match before turning somewhere in the half of the field and rushing to Liverpool's half.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> made a quick addition in the middle of the field.
Then he directed a beautiful passing ball that brought Hazard to the goal.
Hazard surrounded the defence and hit the ball with his left foot in the net on the opposite rack next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play a club match against Napoli in the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will host Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the state disaster department said on Sunday morning.
A spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference that a large number of people were reported trapped in the ruins of a 7.5-magnitude building that felt Friday and caused waves as high as 6 meters.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is full of remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after the woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was launched this morning after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old girl was found at 07:55 with stabbing wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, and the 32-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked people in the area to call if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still at the beginning, but I would like everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to speak to us and see or hear anything suspicious.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is critical to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in the building.
This afternoon on the scene came friends who think they know the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police have said that the closest relatives of the victim are in the process of informing them.
The taxi driver who lives on Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that no one should enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take several hours before they can return to their apartments.
A police officer reportedly told someone that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared at the scene of the crime in tears.
He kept saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 14:00 in the fenced area there were two police vans, and another was parked directly outside.
A large number of police officers were standing inside the fenced area and overseeing the housing block.
Anyone with any information has been asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, referring to Minutes 247 dated September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument to take place in the midst of a debate on the ‘breaking of history’
His pursuit would be poetic justice for the almost Taliban's destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts executed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's attempt "stupid" and "an attempt to end history."
John Goldsmit, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the debate currently taking place regarding the removal of statues, it was imperative that Oliver Cromwell’s character before the Palace of Westminster become the subject of debate.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not something Cromwell ordered or spent.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The wonderful revival of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of a 19th-century way of thinking and part of the historiography of a person many still consider worthy of honor.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwella is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament from external pressure. Of course, in his case it was the pressure of the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely credible opinion is the subject of a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure who represents one side of that division.
His achievements in the role of the Lord of the Protectors continue to be worthy of honor and honor."
Pork killer killed by Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, pigs attacked and killed farmers in a market in southwestern China.
A man named "Yuan" was found dead of cut-out arteries and covered in blood near a stand at a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, China's Southern China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig on May 30, 2005, in Xining, China's Qinghai province.
He reportedly arrived on Wednesday with his family from the neighbouring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, a relative found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pigeon was open.
He said there was a large man in the stable of pigs with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kg had bitten the breeder to death.
Guiyang's evening news reports say a relative named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and swollen."
A security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else as police collect evidence at the scene of the incident.
Yuan's family and the market administration are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely happens, pig attacks on humans have already been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig had settled a Welsh farmer with a tractor while his wife had not driven the animal.
After the pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as an “oxidizer.”
“They’re just played.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rains to the southwestern United States
As announced, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it crosses the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But over the next few days, Rosa will bring flood rains to the area of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 05:00 Eastern time, Rosa blew at a speed of 140 km/h, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southwest of the site of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, a low-pressure area is created and moved to the US West Coast. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to suppress a deep layer of tropical moisture in the north-west direction.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture, in interaction with the surrounding low-pressure area, will cause the formation of strong slopes in much of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous torrential floods, mudslides and possible landslides in the desert.
A deep layer of tropical moisture will cause the formation of slopes that will amount to about 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Even 25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapid deterioration of the conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is by no means advisable to go to the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical storms.
Heavy rain could turn the canyons into wild rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local storm winds and dust gusts.
Approaching low-pressure areas will bring local heavy rains on parts of the coast of southern California.
It is possible to harvest in an amount of more than 12 mm, which can cause less muddy bumps and gravel roads.
It's going to be the first wet season in the region.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday night and early on Monday morning before they cover the wider area at the end of the day on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread on Tuesday to the area where the borders of the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah are being touched and will last all day on Wednesday.
In October, major temperature changes across the U.S. are possible as the Arctic cools, but tropical parts will remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the heat behind the summer heat will continue to grow and expand again.
In most of the central and eastern United States, the beginning of October is expected to warm from 27 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates the high probability of over-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks a tense testimony of candidates for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political accountability has continued, and reporters have suspended a regular schedule to announce a turnaround at the last minute of Friday: an agreement reached by Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona that the FBI will conduct a uniform investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh was in a drunken state and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a burning testimony, said he was absolutely sure it didn't happen.
The hearing on Friday was likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number cited in Nielsen’s report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
It was not immediately available the number of viewers for other networks that broadcast the audition, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually also has trouble measuring the number of people watching content in offices.
To make it better for you, it's an audience that's in number similar to the one watching American football play or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose studio guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during a full-day hearing, Nielsen said in a statement.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
There was still a lot of interest after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning recorded protesters yelling at him as he tried to go to the Justice Committee hearing with an elevator.
A few minutes later, he was caught in the eye of the police while he was being watched live in front of CNN's cameras.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?"
They said to him, "You have power while so many women are helpless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator door closed it would say more at a committee hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks watched live when the Judiciary Committee was supposed to vote to refer Kavanaugh's nomination to a full Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigate the charges against the candidate over the next week, which Democrats in the minority demanded.
Flake was partially convinced by the conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons, and then a few more senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, in another interview in the same issue with her on the cover continued to criticize her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal is that the UK and the EU should pay each other "toll customs fees".
The murder of Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dytheon Simpson suspected of LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on charges of non-compliance, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost glasses in the clash.
Police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and reported that they had found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB, a CBS affiliate, reported.
After Simpson's investigation, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde and killing him.
A security deposit of US$350,000 is required.
The East Baton Rouge County mortuary office on Friday released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The police department is grateful to the Louisiana State Police Task Force on Refugees, the Federal State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for their help in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their "resistance and search for the truth."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 183-cm-high winger grew up in Baton Rouge where his father Wayne also played basketball for the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desperate" and "shocked" at Wayde's death.
"That's what we're always worried about," Wade said.
Vulcans throw ashes at Mexico City
Pepeo, which spews out the Popocatapetl volcano, has reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after heightened activity in the crater and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The center was followed by multiple tunings and underscores.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in Mexico City's neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Catalan separatists and police clash on the eve of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters advocating independence clashed with the intervention police and thousands of people joined the anti-demonstration march to mark the Catalan polarizing vote on the separation.
A group of masked separatists who were prevented by the intervention police began shooting police officers with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
The fighting broke out later in the day when police used sticks to calm the fighting.
For several hours, the independence groups chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness", and the unionists shouted "Long Lived Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital due to minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, the local press reported.
Tensions in the region seeking independence have not subsided a year after the October 1 referendum that Madrid declared illegal, which Catalan separatists celebrate.
The vast majority of voters opted for independence although the exit was small because those who opposed the split were mostly boycotting the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in fierce clashes last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region.
Groups advocating for independence spent Friday night on the streets to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
Demonstrations were held, but the protesters were forced to move on to the second round.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who attended separatist demonstrations with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cry for the happiness they could have voted for, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved a key, albeit close victory in last December's regional elections, Catalonia's independence parties are struggling to maintain momentum this year because their most famous leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detention, where they are waiting for a trial due to their jailbreak.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
“The situation is all tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders, announced to the investigative prison at the end of last year that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"Candidacy for the European elections is the best way to announce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after killing by car at home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after being killed several times in a Londonderry home.
The incident occurred on Thursday at about 19.30 BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective insp. Bob Blemmings said the yard door and the building itself were damaged.
It's possible that at some point, a sniper shot was fired at the car.
Hit Menge brought Livingston victory over the Rangers with a score of 1:0
Dolly Menge's first goal for Livingston brought victory
The new Scottish Premiership club Livingston surprised Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit his second defeat of eighteen games at the club's head of the Ibrox stadium.
Dolly Menge's hit proved decisive as Gary Holt's team lined up with the Iberians in a second.
Gerrard's team is still without a win in the Premiership this season, and next Saturday they play against Hearts, the leading club in the league behind eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday as part of the European League.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt has still not suffered a loss since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston has missed opportunities against dead guests.
Holt's team was supposed to lead even before they scored that shot, given that their straightness in the attack caused a whole range of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried, but there was a delay on the way to the goal, and after that Alan Lithgow could only broadly direct the ball after he cleared to cut a blow to Craig Halkett's head towards the goal.
The hosts gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can cause trouble to the guests
And that's how the key goal was scored.
The Rangers missed a free-kick stop, and Livingston designed the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson assisting the men who hit in the middle of the goal.
By that time, the Rangers had mostly control of the ball, but faced unbeatable home defenses, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly mostly had no business.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the blow.
Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor's legs were apologizing to Scott Pittman, and Lithgow had a wide shot from another organized attack by Livingston.
Long additions failed to cross Livingston's goal line, and two eleven-year-olds were not awarded - after Halkett's clash with substitute Glenn Middleton and one for hand play.
“Excellent” from Livingston – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from the Scottish BBC at the Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a great game and Livingston's score.
All up to one was excellent, so they continued to exceed expectations on that inbound journey.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since their return among the big clubs, but the great credit goes to Holt and the way he has united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant at leading an excellently organized defense, and Menga throughout the game did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worra to have a reluctance.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards that set a good game under Gerrard.
They failed to reach the ball until the end. They only once opened a hole in the home team and this is a kind of invitation to compete for the Rangers who are in the middle of the ladder.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an welcomed with mixed feelings in Koeln
On Saturday (September 29th) there was a lot of laughter under the watchful skies when the leaders of the Turks and Germans met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – the goal of which is to repair relations between NATO allies.
They have explored their views on issues that include human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Koeln to open a huge new mosque.
Turkey has the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police blocked the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but a large number of presidential supporters who came to see him appeared nearby.
And hundreds of protesters against Erdogan – including a large number of Kurds – raised their voices by condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The conflicted demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor whom some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others attack as an autocrat.
Road crash in Deptford: cyclist killed in car crash
The cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Street, on a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash took place months after another cyclist died after a crash and a driver fled from a crash site on Chiders Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday's crash site.
The city police said police officers were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relative.
Due to the accident, roads are closed and bus traffic is diverted, and motor vehicle drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Trouble
The prison administration said six police officers had been injured in a riot in a man's prison of a closed type.
The riots broke out in Long Martin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special "Tornado" troops were brought in to counter unrest involving eight prisoners and were limited to one wing.
Police officers on the spot were provided with assistance due to minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison staff have been hired to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of the staff received help from the injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that all those responsible will be handed over to the police and that we can spend longer behind bars."
There are more than 500 inmates in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was announced that the prison manager had ended up in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the intervention police were called to prison to solve a serious situation in which staff were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with torrential flooding (possible benefit for dry areas)
It’s rare for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it’s likely to happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert southwest and brings danger from torrential flooding.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued warnings of torrential flooding for Monday and Tuesday in the area of western Arizona, across southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach Phoenix late Monday in the rain and cross straight through it on Tuesday.
The National Hydrometeorological Service of Phoenix said in a tweet: “Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or depression in a circle of 320 kilometers from Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts 50 to 100 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 150 mm on the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest, including the Rock and Big Pool, there is a probability of slopes from 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated totals up to 100 mm.
For those out of danger from the torrential floods Rosa could come as a rescue because the region is hit by a drought.
Although floods are a great danger, some of these rims could be useful because in the southwest there is currently a drought.
"According to the U.S. map of dry areas, just over 40 percent of Arizona has been hit by at least extreme drought, the second-highest category," weather.com said in a statement.
The storm's course first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 130 km/h and was located 620 km south of the site of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moved north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm found its way into the colder waters of the Pacific, and so it weakened.
Therefore, the coast of Mexico is expected to approach on Monday afternoon or at night by the force of a tropical storm.
Rain in parts of Mexico could be strong and poses a significant risk of flooding.
“The amount of total precipitation expected in the area from the Baja California Peninsula to the northwest Sonore is from 75 to 150 mm, possibly a maximum of 250 mm,” weather.com said in a statement.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning on Tuesday as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and southern Utah until late Tuesday night.
“The main danger that is expected from Rose or her remains is very heavy rain on the Baja California Peninsula, northwest Sonora, and in the U.S. Desert Southwest,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will cause a life-threatening torrential flood and mudslides in the deserts and slopes on the mountain terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
Around 04.00 BST on Saturday at the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, an injured teenager was found.
He was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
The Avon and Somerset Police Department said a 17-year-old, 2 18-year-old and 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Police officers have asked everyone who has a video of the incident to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh suffered the anger and anger of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a pre-election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "suffering the anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and resolutely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at a hearing about the charges she filed.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in public service,” he told rallying supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republicans running for office in the middle of the presidential term.
“Five weeks have made us one of the most important choices in our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I am,” he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said the Democrats’ mission was to “create resistance and obstruction.”
A Republican leadership aide told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of people have died in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to rise.
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people had died, many of whom were driven away by huge waves hitting the coast when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Pal on Friday when in the dark waves of up to six meters high struck the coast, dragging many of them to death and ruining everything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When a tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately run and died," Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, dams, houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survive,” he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palua.
Photographs from the air published by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake that coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the massive quake on Friday matched the double force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the building and added that 540 people were injured and 29 are considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of casualties and damage may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palua, in an area called Donggala and closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications have been completely suspended and we have no information from the Donggala."
"There are more than 300,000 people living in this area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers had been sent to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a plethora of criticism over the lack of information that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials say the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of the building can be heard panickingly warning people down the street about the upcoming tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the water wall collapsed on the coast, carrying buildings and cars.
The Reuters news agency was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that led to a disruption of communications around Palua, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
According to the competent army, it began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still needed food and other necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palua on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has claimed more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
“Although World Vision staff from Donggala successfully arrived in the city of Pal, where employees were drawn to the Tarpaulin tents set up in the courtyard of their office, they passed through the scenes of destruction on the way,” Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched rescue wheels in the disaster, some have complained that foreign humanitarians with great expertise have been prevented from arriving in Pal.
According to Indonesian regulations, the financing, supply and engagement of personnel from other countries can only begin if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Red Cross.
“After the government says ‘OK, it’s a national disaster’ we can accept international aid, but such a state has not yet been declared.”
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami fell on Palo on Friday, friends and families of those still considered missing still hoped that their loved ones would be one of those wonders that alleviate the black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Saturday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, head coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those captured at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were his students.
“Given the many years spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled that after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, which expanded to the paraglider community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitions from Palua that took part in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a gray dot, instead of two blue dots.
“I think that means the messages are not delivered,” he said.
The thieves stole 26,750 U.S. dollars while charging ATMs at Newport on the Levee
The thieves stole 26,750 U.S. dollars from Brink's employees who filled a ATM in the center of Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, the Newport Police Department said in a statement.
Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement that the driver of the car had emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While busy with it, the other man “came to Brink’s employee behind the wheel” and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in the ATM.
Witnesses have noticed more suspicious people fleeing the scene of the robbery, but police have not specified the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changing my name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
In a Twitter post announcing the change, he wrote: "Live will officially be known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
The show's authors said he replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled it for "emotional reasons."
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current artistic name, West has previously stated that the word has religious significance for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year in an interview about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s me, it’s us.
It started from Kanye, which means “the only one,” in only Ye – it’s a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything in us.
The album itself is a reflection of who we are.”
He's one of a number of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And West's former co-worker, JAY-Z, played with versions of his name without a cartoon and with a cartoon and written in big letters.
Mexico's AMLO says it will not use the military against its citizens
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he will never use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday promised in Tlatelolco Square that "he will never use the army against the Mexican people."
Military troops fired during peaceful demonstrations on the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at the time when left-wing student movements began to spread to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to those studying and by opening a larger number of free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities attract young criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
“As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it invests in research in the field,” said Kai Fu Lee, an artificial intelligence investor and expert in the field who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment followed after various parts of the U.S. government announced plans for artificial intelligence, although the U.S. lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence in principle.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the first country by the number of AI innovations by 2030.
“A double increase in the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and that we are looking for the next big discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
“A double increase in investment could double the chances that by the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence it will come to the United States,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee’s book, AI superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and New World Order, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the CEO of Innovation Ventures, which invests in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon worked on an AI system that won the best American player of the game Othello, and was later director of Microsoft's research department and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee praised the U.S. government’s previous technological competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
“It’s not China that leads academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired the brightest minds from the university to work on artificial intelligence research in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that PhD students in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
China's state council announced the next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
“The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial resources to individuals in academic institutions similar to the National Foundation for Science and other state organizations provide financial resources to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to involve partners from the activities and academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of the Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of US$2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonia voted in a referendum to change its country's name
On Saturday, the citizens of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that could resolve a dispute with Greece that has been going on for several decades and which has blocked Greece from opening negotiations for accession to the Euro.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia, and Greece claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents the dispossession of its territory and has vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed on a proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the exit will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
A question on the referendum ballot read: “Are you for membership in NATO and the EU with the acceptance of an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, say it is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the break-up of Yugoslavia, access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians so that they could live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because that means safer lives for all of us,” said Oliver Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote was not legally binding, enough MPs said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities were reported until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent during the last parliamentary elections of 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, it’s our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjosa Tanevski, a voter from Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko, in Strumica on September 30, 2018, joined the referendum on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje and received chairs in front of the tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised heads, not as servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to receive us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring so much needed investment to Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority will support the referendum, as more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said the “positive” result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will vote in the referendum, which is below the required response.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV's Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the exit must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes through Brighton's entire defence to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England defeated Brighton's defense and took a 2-0 win for Manchester City.
Aguero made the victory crazy simple, reaching a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received an addition in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
He went through three Brighton defense players and then got to the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opposing players in the green jerseys.
He bypassed one of the defenders, and then overtook a few of them on the edge of Brighton's space.
He then added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The English striker from the first attempt returned the ball to Aguera, who threw the right ball into the right side of the net and defeated Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some difficulty with his foot,” Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We wanted to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're happy he scored a goal at the moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues an early lead in the Premier League.
That shot was scored in the 29th minute.
During this game, Aguero won the ball deep in Brighton's field.
He beautifully added the ball to Leroy Saneu along the left side.
Sane pushed the ball a few times before Sterling got to the stand.
The Sky Blues striker put the ball into the net just before slipping into the car.
Manchester City are fighting Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 am at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to prevent the advancement of the Rockies
Since the Nationals players were eliminated from the playoffs, there was not much reason to insist on a new start.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes Sunday's win against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, get into play.
The Rockies on Friday night with a 5:2 win over the Nationals at least secured a spot in wild-card play, but still hope to win their first title.
“While we’re playing for nothing, we can at least throw away knowing what the atmosphere is here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I’d witness this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in that?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a Sunday starter, but are reportedly willing to offer Scherzer to play.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up in the pitch on Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
Washington's right-hander this season achieved a score of 18:7, a winning run average (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds changes.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
During his speech on the importance of Republican voters' exits in the general election, the president boldly commented on his choice of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge.
“Everything we’ve done will be on trial in November.
It's another five weeks until one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the big, big ones – I didn’t run, but I’m actually in the race and that’s why I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump continues: “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this is happening right now.
Their intention is to retake power in any way; you see evil, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to overcome to take over power and control; that's why they want power and control. We're not going to give them."
The Democrats, he says, have a mission to “resist and interfere.”
“You’ve seen this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, evil, corrupt, and lying.”
He spoke to Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee on behalf of the Senate, which caused a loud public outcry.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leave the document in public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for a document — it was really a bad body speech, the worst body speech I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer accepting different opinions.
It does not tolerate the expression of personal opinions.
I was not too surprised when the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I am the last in a series of Labour Party representatives who were told they were not welcome – all because of what we were told in our mind.
According to my colleague, Joan Ryan, they behaved similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized in the censorship proposal for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy Corbyn did not agree with the previous leadership.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour Party branch meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years I have been working as a local Labour Party representative, the meetings of the General Council on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, nowadays, many meetings take place in a different tone, and the promise of a "kinder, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as the co-workers I thought would share similar political opinions with me began to demand a drastic change of opinion and to take positions that I would otherwise never agree with – whether it was a national security market or the EU’s national security market.
Whenever I address the public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there is a buzz of offensive words on social networks calling for my resignation, rejecting the centre’s policies and telling me I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I've had more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments I've been given are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of a colleague who is confronted with an avalanche of sexist or racist comments on a daily basis, but never ceases.
One of the aspects of this political era that disappointed me the most is the tolerance of offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with every proposal on distrust or change of electoral rules, we are becoming an increasingly narrow-minded party.
Many times in the last two years they advised me to raise my head, not to be so loud and told me that then everything would be okay.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the neglect of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who abandoned my school multi-purpose classroom, I have wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most – either as a local councilor or minister in government.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East could have been misled about my political stances and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would like to say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country is pulling towards Brexit that will negatively affect households, companies and public services, I do not understand the desire to lose time and energy to my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of revocation or political benefit will deter me from acting in the best interest of yours.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 unbeaten Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat affected the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of the day in Tennent's Premiership League.
They have now reached the top of the ladder and are the only undefeated of ten teams.
In the end, superior defenses and better use of opportunities led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had a reason to be satisfied.
"So far we've been tried in every game and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose Club said: “In honor of Ayra, they took advantage of the opportunity better than us.”
The 14th-minute attempt by Grant Anderson by Frazier Climo led Ayr to the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance to raise the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of the unrealized.
Climo increased Ayr's lead to an 11-year-old before, in the half-time itself, he scored a goal and made a stand-alone attempt to change the result for Ayr at 17:5 on the eve of the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, who realized Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then a long break occurred due to a serious injury to Ruaridha Knott, which they took on the bearings, and when the game continued, Ayr continued to play well with the attempt of Stafford McDowall by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again forced an additional player to pay, with the unrealized attempt of Bruce Colvine at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to destroy the Clima that did not have a ball; from the penalty line, MacPherson made a placement behind Ayr in a full-blown breakthrough.
Climo realized, as he had done almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe received a high blow from David Armstrong and sent side player Gregor Henry in the fifth try of the home team.
The star of the Still Game series seems ready for a new career in restaurant business
Ford Kiernan, the star of the Still Game series, seems ready to continue working in the service after it was discovered that he was appointed director of the licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in his favorite BBC series, which is a screenwriter and one of the stars, along with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last to be aired, and Kiernan seems to be planning to dedicate his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source for the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wants to engage in "growing restaurant activity in Glasgow".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will grant it access to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol the sea center with the elevators in La Paz.
The flag of the color of the ocean has been reported in public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon or the Cretaceous: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to bring him back.”
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of a lost sea coast in favor of Chile during the 19th century conflict over resources is still alive – just like the longing for re-launching the Pacific Ocean.
While Bolivia is awaiting the verdict of the International Court of Justice expected on October 1, following a five-year trial, the hopes may be at the highest level in the last few decades.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, is optimistic about the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
The crowd of Bolivians across the country will watch the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens and hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's position that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate the resignation of the sovereign sea of Bohol.
Evo Morales, a Bolivian charismatic autochthonous president who faces a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, could also benefit from Monday's ruling.
“We are beyond the reach of the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will judge in favor of Bolivia and that a little of that would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the final hearings means that the case “was not complex,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interests, they may have backfired for the last four years.
"The question of access to the sea has been adopted by the current Bolivian leadership," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' war rhetoric buried every good will of Chile, he believes.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the dialogue, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court has made the decision unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an "unprecedented opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "stop 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most beloved presidents – used the maritime issue as a political pawn.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“It’s an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past.”
North Korea says it won't get nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be nuclearly disarmed if they could not trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to keep the promises of the day during the meeting of the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
The comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be inclined to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, coming more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said the sanctions continued because of "empty imaginations" and that the U.S.'s opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War would not put the North on its knees at all.
Washington is not inclined to support the declaration without Pyongyang first taking concrete steps to disarm.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's serious intention to relinquish the arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion magazines reveal that the last line of the big ones covered their heads on the way to luxury shopping in your neighborhood
If you want to improve your collection of hats or completely cover the sun, do not look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne on the fashion runway presented a line of tangled sheaths to the head for their spring and summer collection in 2019 and delighted fans of style at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats this summer made Instagram, and these designers sent their creations that attract attention on the runway.
The example that stood out was designed by Valentino, and it is a large beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like ring that completely "taken over" the head of the model.
Other bulky add-ons included jewelry-encrusted shells, magic hats, and even pineapple, but these add-ons are not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had curly lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than high-fashion pieces.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a breather and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
If you follow a big fashion expression – happiness is on your side.
The stylists predict that huge caps could come to the luxury shops in your neighborhood.
The huge hats fit perfectly with the subtitle "La Bomba", a straw hat with a circumference of approximately 60 cm that has been seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand that stands behind the extremely impractical hat that has subdued social networks on the fashion runway has sent another big creation – a strawberry beach bag almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that wore it.
Zagasito’s orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia slices and white leather lunches, was an exhibition copy in the summer collection of Jacquemus’ La Riviera for 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
The stylist of the famous and famous, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags in luxury stores for next summer. Since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large fashion accessories.”
John Edward: The Language Skills the World Needs
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of excellent test results, and the added weight of this give individual and joint successes in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the career they want to pursue and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement this school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a favorite and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it goes to his heart."
This statement is a powerful reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results from this year's final exams show that the highest scores in the languages were achieved by students of independent schools.
A total of 68% of the students who taught foreign languages received excellent grades.
The data collected in 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of students received excellent scores for the Mandarin language, while 72% of students learning German, 69% of students learning French and 63% of students learning Spanish also received the highest scores.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, languages as elective subjects are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as in other places.
A survey conducted by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17 % of employers are unable to fill their jobs due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more an imperative to prepare young people for careers.
As more and more jobs require knowledge of languages, skills are key in the globalized world.
Regardless of the choice of career, people who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the benefits of such long-term skills.
A person who speaks multiple languages can communicate directly with strangers, which gives them an advantage over competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey involving more than 4,000 adults, 75% of respondents in the United Kingdom do not know a foreign language well enough to communicate on it, and French is the only language that speaks a two-digit percentage of respondents, namely 15%.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland, every school offers different languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their program, while others will choose the languages that are considered to be the most important in the UK in 2020, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, independent schools will always have a diverse selection, as well as teaching staff who are expert in the field.
Scottish independent schools allow children an environment in which they will learn to prepare and equip themselves with the skills necessary for success, regardless of what the future holds for us.
One cannot ignore the fact that, in today's global business, knowledge of language is very important for the future of each country, so it must also be reflected in education.
Thus, knowledge of modern languages should indeed be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer a choice of language, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Council of Scottish Independent Schools.
LeBron will play for the Lakers for the first time on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans will soon welcome LeBron James' first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in his first pre-season game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We still don't know how many minutes he'll play.
“More than one and less than 48 minutes,” Walton told the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is not likely to play the entire game.
After training earlier this week, James answered questions about his plans for the Lakers preseason, which consists of six games.
“At this stage of my career, I really don’t need a pre-season game,” he said.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin a campaign with numerous rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned rallies that Trump will hold next week, including brief visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet cast his vote for a new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming election because there is a risk that Republicans will lose a majority in Congress after the November vote.
What time does the Trump rally in West Virginia begin tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled to take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearing of Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has sparked controversy over allegations of sexual abuse. The Senate's confirmed decision is already a week before the FBI's investigation ends.
But the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans achieve an election advantage in November.
That’s why Trump’s presidential campaign headquarters said the five rallies scheduled for next week are aimed at “stimulating volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“The majority in Congress is so important to the president’s plans that he will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter the raging campaign,” an anonymous Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The gathering, which will be held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh," reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month on Saturday. In that country, he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senate Republican candidate Patrick Morrisey from West Virginia, who is behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must help him improve the rankings in the polls,” said Simon Haedar, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team left its heart on the field ahead of individual crashes on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the pair's breakup on Sunday afternoon may well be exactly what was meant to reverse the Ryder Cup.
"The wheel of happiness turns" is a phrase that is especially true in sports and in which athletes believe, and especially in competitions like this.
To whom is the wheel of fortune now favored?
“They had six points and now they have four, so I think happiness is on our side right now,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
The Europeans are ahead with four points, while the remaining 12 points remain until the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in the back and encouraged his game in pairs with Justin Thomas, with whom he won three out of four points after a full-day game.
Spieth has played killer from tea to green and can serve as an example to others.
The cheerleading chants became louder as Spieth and Thomas reached two points behind, all culminating in the key path that Spieth reached with an unsolved result.
After the 15 hole game, a similar cheering url followed, in which hope and faith can be recognized that Americans can turn it all around.
“You just have to concentrate and think about your game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for the players now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who have won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup sensation.
The European odd but irresistible pair has the maximum number of points and can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but he also avoided a bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as a back nine on Friday morning.
This winning streak, as well as the incredible energy connecting Fleetwood and Molinari, show that they are exactly the players to win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two of them that can seal the victory of the Europeans as the sun sets over Paris’ Le Golf National.
Maybe both take the win at the same time on different holes.
But it is too early to talk about the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly managed Alex Noren and Sergio Garcia, who had a great performance in the couple's morning game.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes on the playground buried the Spaniard and the Swedes in a hole from which they failed to dig.
However, on Sunday there will be no one who will help individuals to dig out of their hole.
It’s fascinating to watch couples’ games closely because you can see the interactions of the players in the couple, hear the tips they give and those they don’t give, as well as study a strategy that can change at the moment.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far, and on the last day they come in with a significant advantage, but this pairing has also shown that the U.S. team has the necessary fighting skills, which some, especially Stateside, have doubted.
Europeans on the last day of the Ryder Cup come in with a lead of 10 : 6
Europeans after Saturday's games in pairs on the last day of the Ryder Cup enter with a significant advantage over the US of 10:6.
Dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two wins over Tiger Woods led with four points difference at the Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn in an effort to win the trophy that he missed in Hazeltine two years ago was more powerful than the American team in the morning games in pairs, achieving a score of 3:1.
The U.S. team showed greater fighting in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points was already great.
To win the trophy, teams of Jim Furyk must collect eight points in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood was the first European team debutant to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood", were the second pair to win four points in a pairing in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball, they turned out to be the top scorers in the game against Woods and U.S. debutant Bryson Dechambeau in a 5–4 win.
Woods, who did not show the best performance in two Saturday games, made some brilliant moves, but now has 19 defeats out of 29 games in fourball and pairs and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning fourballs to get back in the game with partner Henrik Stanson and suffered a 2&1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the world's first and third-best player.
But the Europeans didn’t quite go as far as being anointed during a pleasant day south-east of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday and set the ladder high for their U.S. team.
They first beat Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter 2&1 in fourballs, and then beat Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the entire history of the Ryder Cup, the team that was behind four points managed to return to individual games, although Fury's team only needed an undecided result to keep the trophy.
After two days in a row, it seems that their Sunday counterattack will be hard to fall.
North Korea says it has "no chance" of unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's foreign minister on Saturday told the United Nations that further sanctions are increasing distrust of the United States and that there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly last year that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" to halt nuclear and missile tests, dismantled a nuclear testing station, and made a decision to halt the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
“However, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States,” he added.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we don’t have faith in our national security either. Under such circumstances, there’s no way we’re going to unilaterally disarm first.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "progressive" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would gradually lift sanctions, his statement is significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current U.S. president and leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," while Trump was confident.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean War that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has conditioned Pyongyang to give up nuclear weapons before that.
Washington has also ignored calls for a reduction in strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists that denuclearization be carried out earlier and increases pressure by sanctions to forcibly achieve its goal, and even oppose the 'proclamation of the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is just a delusion of people who don’t know anything about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases distrust."
Ri did not mention whether there were plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US president spoke about earlier this week in the United Nations.
But the minister said Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in had held as many as three meetings over the past five months and added: "If South Korea had sought denuclearization, not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come as far as this."
Despite everything, the tone of the speech of Minister Rija was vastly different from that of last year when he spoke in front of the UN General Assembly and stated that targeting the continental United States of America missiles was inevitable after the evil President Trump called Kim "a man-made missile."
Trump, who threatened last year to "totally destroy" North Korea this year in the United Nations, praised Kim for his courage to disarm, but added that more work is waiting for them and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea executes a denier.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no timeframe for denuclearization and added: "It doesn't matter if it will take two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “Implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue strictly until complete, final and verified denuclearization is achieved.”
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to halt funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Rio at the UN General Assembly and then said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea called him after hours because of “gangster demands.”
North Korea has agreed a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and the nuclear complex that will be realized if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He added that Kim revealed that these "appropriate measures" relate to the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilisation of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard attend a course where they learn how to rest well.
A new course at Harvard University has enabled all students to get a good night's sleep in an attempt to combat an increasingly widespread culture of learning with caffeine and sleepless nights.
The academic found that students at the world's best university often have no idea about the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, devised a course he considers to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He came up with the idea of a course after he gave a talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, "Why did I just find out about this at the last year of college?"
She said no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help in academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University's Health Service Paul Barreira said the University decided to introduce the course after students were noticed with a serious lack of sleep during the week.
A one-on-one course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a student dorm where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how a lack of sleep affects success, and how important a sleep routine is.
During the lecture, students learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons is then displayed that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect health,” added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride for full-time learning before exams still exists, says the professor, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is an ever-increasing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality sleep. Sleeping also helps in the fight against obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it into a state of starvation and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler devise a course after attending his lectures at Harvard's first year.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to extend the course to the entire campus.
As a next step, it plans to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar subject before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to turn on the alarm during sleep, as well as during waking up. They must be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" that emit screens of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Mengin goal defeat Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after Dolly Menge's hit hit a missing defense of Steven Gerrard and finished the game with Livingston's 1–0 win.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first innings after a 4:1 win in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games, so his team now lags eight points in the Ladbrokes Premier League.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers seemed to be out of inspiration and didn't seem to match the result.
As the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third with only one event behind Hibernian.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence sustained a head injury when an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes on the sides and thus stretched alongside Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livingston squad who took the measure last week and would be delighted that his well-designed squad had stifled every attempt by the opponent.
The Rangers may have had more possession of the ball, but Livingston has achieved more with it.
They had a chance to make an appearance just two minutes after Menga was kicked out of the game for the first time, opening space for Scott Pittman to head for Allan McGregor's goal, however, the midfielder missed the opportunity.
The deep free kick of Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass an inaccurate blow to the rear rows.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game they seemed to play with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that the judge should have sentenced him to 11 in the 15th minute after his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not consider Columbia's request.
The Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half, but one blow to Liam Kelly's former goalkeeper, Lassane Coulibaly, and a foolish blow to Ovie Ejari, did not pose a big problem.
Although Livingston's 34-minute play slowed down the game, no one can deny their efforts.
The Rangers have again failed to take advantage of Jacobs' deep-backed ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson who retained his grip and selected Meng for a simple end to the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had a momentary effect because the winger added the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into exactly the same game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett made one long blow after another.
Holt's side could extend the lead in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide corner outing.
Ranger's replacement Glenn Middleton once again sought an 11-year-old because he broke up with Jacobs, but Thomson took a look this time around.
Almanah: The Invention of the Geiger Numeral
And now follows the page from our Almanac in the show "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a few days...the birthday of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from this invention a device known as the Geiger counter was later developed.
The mainstay of science since that time, Geiger's numerator has also become the mainstay of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Colorado" in which the main roles were played by seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it, for God's sake?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear atoms reacting to radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: “Look at this, you can hear it!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” bad cells and destroy them
“The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment.
The procedure involves extracting cells of the immune system from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
The cells are treated so that they can "recognise" a protein that is common to many types of cancer and then re-inject into the patient.
The experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has been receding for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves extracting cells of the immune system from the patient, changing them in the laboratory to be able to “recognise” a protein called HER2 that is common to many types of cancer and re-injecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and colon cancer," explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting cells of the immune system from the patient and their “learning” how to recognize cancer cells was successful in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after hosting the Saturday Night Live show, took part in discussions about Trump and supported him, wearing a cap with the caption "Let's Make America Great Again".
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was screened in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a breakout performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the evening called Ghost Town during which he wore a cap with the caption "Let's Make America Great Again", he continued to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often and they tell me, 'How you like Trump, he's a racist.'
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the video of West's speech on social media was transmitted by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to upset West with the announcement.
Also, West complained to the audience that he was being told behind the scenes about the cap he was wearing.
“I was upset behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go anywhere with that hood."
They abused me!
They said I drowned," the Washington Examiner reported.
West continued: “Do you want to see the bottom?”, and said that he would wear his Superman coat because it means they can’t tell him what to do. Do you want the world to progress?
“Try with love.”
Variety magazine wrote that his comments had at least twice caused the audience to get upset, and members of the Saturday Night Live show were embarrassed, while one person told the magazine: “The whole studio was silent.”
West was last called in as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
West's performance of the song "I Love It", dressed like Perrier's bottle of mineral water, amazed many.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the head of the TPUSA conservative group, who posted on Twitter: “One of the most courageous people: THANK YOU for being a MAFI.”
However, show host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was simply “his own and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes or by supporting his ‘art’) whom I believe to accept and spread an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he would now "officially be known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the late music legend Prince changed its name to a symbol, and then to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder of a knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder of a man at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police have reported that the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast Criminal Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the prosecution.
Star of the series Game of Thrones Kit Harington wakes up to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for the role of Jon Snow who plays the sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy of the Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor leaned on the hero's cat stereotype, saying that because of such TV roles, boys often feel they have to be strong to get respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie from the Game of Thrones series, admitted he wanted to "very decisively" deal with the problem.
“I personally feel very strongly at this moment – where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
“What did we teach men as they grew up, in relation to the problem that we now see?”
Kit believes that television, thanks to the very masculine characters on the screens, could be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What was born and what was learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets, and that makes boys feel like they have to have those particular lines of a man?
I think that’s actually one of the big questions of our time – how can we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong for the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be filming the sequels to the Game of Thrones series after the end of next summer and said that he "finished with the battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a new performance of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of the film producer and his brother being robbed.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks meeting Rose's wife was the best thing that ever happened to him while filming the Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife filming that series, which gave me the family and the future of life,” he said.
Rose in a fantastic series that won the Emmy Award played the role of Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported an increase in new cases of disease of 14%
China has reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases of the infection have been transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, the Chinese health authorities said that people who are infected with HIV in this way almost did not.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV by sex is a constant problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is a large one.
Studies estimate that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman because of conservative values in the country.
Many cases of transmission of the disease in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of efforts to address this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of staff of the public has submitted information about the GOP senators, calling it “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Representative Maxine Walters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia.
A Los Angeles Democrat says the claims are being spread by “ultra-right wing” individuals as well as websites.
“Lies, lies, and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The data allegedly contained the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, and was published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a hearing in the Senate regarding allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address revealing the source of the publication of this data belongs to the Waters office, as well as information about the representative's staff member, reported The Hill newspaper.
"These unfounded statements are completely false and absolutely false," Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and untrue allegations – is not responsible for the leaking of those data.
"These unsubstantiated statements are completely false and absolutely false."
Ms Waters' statement quickly attracted critics on the Internet, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
“It shows that Waters doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do shouldn't be angry.
He can't be rude.
The motive of the accused shall not be reviewed.
It has to be calm and stable."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Barbara Walters' reaction to criticisms by Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who competes in the general election against Waters, also announced on Twitter.
"That's important if it's true," he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that her office had informed "the law enforcement authorities and law enforcement agencies" of these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she continued.
Review of “Johnny English: Again on a Task” – Not Interesting Rowan Atkinson Fights a Spy
It is now commonplace in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems that so in the new screening of the action series "Johnny English" whose first sequel, "Johnny English", first aired in 2003 and "Johnny returned to the big screens on English screens in 2011.
Will the twisted own satire about how obviously worthless we are to become a new national export opportunity?
Johnny English's incapacitated eyes and rubber face are again allowed to complicate situations, while his name says more than anything that it's a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinema isn't in English.
He is, of course, an outspoken secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to a "diluted" glamor reminiscent of Inspector Clouseau, has a dash of character Mr. Bean and somewhat reminiscent of the boy who sang one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire."
His character is also inspired by a traveler and mysterious world man once played by Atkinson in the now-forgotten television commercials for Barclaycard and who is the oligarch of chaos.
There is one or two good moments in this latest release of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the propeller hit his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but the humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually exaggerated, especially now that "serious" movie titles like "007" and "Impossible Missions" offer elements of comedy themselves.
Humor feels like it's meant for children, not adults. In my opinion, Johnny English's twisted events are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's silent gags embodied in the character of Mr. Bean.
The assumption that the UK is in serious trouble is now already a widely accepted fact.
Hacker broke into Britain's most secret web-based spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents, to the horror of an agent in office, who unfortunately appears briefly to be played by Kevin Eldon.
It poured a glass of Prime Minister's patience, an overbearing and warlike character who experiences a complete breakdown of the system because he is politically loathed: Emma Thompson is trying to faithfully portray a character that should represent Theresa May, but she didn't quite get the material to do anything with.
Intelligence advisors reveal to her that all active spies have been compromised and will therefore need to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And this person will be reckless Johnny English head and chin who is currently employed as the director of some sort of school rendition, but the story teaches how to become a secret agent: here he has a few handsome gigs because English teaches rocker-style spying.
The English quickly take them to the government premises for an emergency meeting, where they meet again with Bough, a former partner and his eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an overly enthusiastic submarine commander, played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely wasted.
And so the two members of the Secret Service of Her Majesty, who are all doing absolutely wrong, return to action and meet the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an exciting journey with absurd and ridiculous events: disguised as a canoe-flavored French restaurant, they challenge a huge mess by smuggling a luxury yacht on Voltaire, and English provokes a complete anarchy by trying to use the virtuosity of how the virtuosos use the virtuosos.
Everything was done properly for this last sequel, but no matter how attractive and repulsive the film still contains a subset of children's elements.
It's a pretty central achievement.
And as was the case with other Johnny English films, I wondered again whether the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would match his talent?
The Labour Party has rejected a plan for the British to work four days a week and get paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider a radical plan that the British would work four days a week and be paid for five-day work.
The party reportedly wants the bosses to pass on to the workers the savings achieved by the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) and give them an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea could be "engaged" into the party's economic agenda and plans for the country to be in the interests of workers.
The trade union congress supported the move to a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
“A four-day work week will not be realized overnight, but it is a desire that fits in with the approach that this party has towards balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not accept this desire in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not the party’s policy and the party is not considering it.”
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week’s Labour Party conference to work out his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to transfer power from the hands of “indifferent directors” and “profiters” in municipal enterprises.
The Chancellor’s plans in the shadow also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to return their entire stake because the Labour government could make “debts” based on perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include employees on the company’s board of directors and create inclusive equity funds to give 10 percent of private companies’ capital to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency's conclusion could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility that the FBI would discover something that would prompt them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said going to the debate, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after the instructions were given to you, and asked, 'Did you do that?'
He was determined, unflinching, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, seemed to be carved in stone.
“I’m determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and I really should have a strong accusation to change that,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has absolutely denied everything,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people she appointed could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved anything in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive star list and an equally impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only the performances of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real purpose of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay a VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "work" such as volunteering, sending an email to the world leader, phone calls or any other meaningful way of raising awareness about their goal.
But how successful was the Global Citizen considering that he had 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to demand a call to action, or just another case of so-called “clitivism” – where people feel that by signing an online petition or tweeting they really change something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters who sought to achieve a range of different goals.
He claims that these actions have been an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to the amount of more than $37 billion, which by 2030 will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements that stemmed from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the funds secured have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and executives in the UK who are committed to "helping children develop to their full potential", with the promise that after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the world's citizens, they will provide 35 million donations to the charity.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can achieve that social injustice of malnutrition becomes only a melting pot in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Foundation, to the public at a 2018 London grassroots concert.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the “The Power of Nutrition” project that will provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
The Global Citizen replies: “It will be a long and arduous journey and we will never fail.
But we will succeed, as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements have succeeded before us, because together we are stronger.
The performances of Janet Jackson, Weeknda, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e belong to some of the performances at this year's New York event that will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy as a “block” to prevent Russia’s energy exports <0xCC><0xB6> Minister of the Interior
Washington can, “if necessary,” use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said in a statement.
Zinke said that Russian involvement in Syria <0xCC><0x88> particularly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government <0xCC><0x88> is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason Russia in the Middle East is that it wants to sell energy in that area, as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,” he said.
But, in his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the openness of maritime routes and blockade, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at an event hosted by the non-profit Consumer Energy Alliance group, which in the U.S. presents itself as the "voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually the same.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less the use of fuel and the replacement of fuel,” he said, and for Russia it “serves the same trick” in fossil-fuel-dependent economies.
The statements were given at the same time as the Trump administration's intention to increase the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this sense, officials of the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is worth $11 billion, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position sparked a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country gets involved in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the possibility of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts State Senator
Massachusetts State Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" the candidacy for president after the midterm elections.
During a direct meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for president.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means a woman at the head,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren delivered an opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying that "this country is heading in the wrong direction".
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most Warren voters don't think they should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe's Center for Political Research, fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed greater support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% of the vote for a potential candidacy and 48% against.
The other prominent Democratic nominees discussed in connection with the potential 2020 presidential race are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin recalls PTSP Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence that occurred on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through after his return, is comparable to other families who feel the effects of PTSD and other wounds that our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience at Donald Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem that was silent for both his son and other war veterans, saying that "they come back a little different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots are, and all other members of the army, gave to this."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla City Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support the review of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy to deny asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and counties filed a friendly report on Friday in Washington to provide support to an asylum seeker who is challenging politics, NBC News reports.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against Sessions filed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who backed Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which come from a large number of asylum-seekers in the U.S., as countries facing ubiquitous gang problems and family violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has changed the Immigration Board's 2014 decision to allow immigrants who do not have documents to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombian District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications are settled on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances of the lawsuit, and such a ban violates that principle,” the court’s friend said in a report.
Lawyers further argued that policies that deny entry to immigrants harm the U.S. economy, arguing that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a policy statement on June 11.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems – not even all the serious problems – that people face on a daily basis around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palua as the number of victims doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“The situation is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her boy who was shaking in a fever in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palou.
“The ambulances bring in the bodies every minute.
The government is running out of clean water."
Residents are seen returning to their destroyed homes, sifting through flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, were cremated.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured back and shoulder, rested in front of the Palou Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous strong subsequent earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he spoke of the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to be saved.
I think I was trapped inside the rubble of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Maltreating’ Through ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published four pages of a long ad in the U.S. daily newspaper that promoted the mutual benefit of U.S. trade with China, a U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of abusing U.S. propaganda press.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday drew attention to a paid addition to the China Daily in Iowa's top-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials described in a statement to Reuters as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliation at the start of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, China's main exporter of agricultural products, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branstad said that China “now doubles this mistreatment by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press by putting paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, you will find limited voices of opposition at a newspaper kiosk on the streets of Beijing and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on the disturbing Chinese economic path because the media are under strong pressure from the Communist Party,” he said.
He added that "some of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspapers were concerned.
With Kavanaugh's debacle, Republicans distanced voters ahead of midterm elections, analysts warn
As many Republicans stand with Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and defend him over several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming midterm elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event have been quite agitated, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their voice.
Such things can't come back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell University School of Syracuse, said in an article published Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubt that Senator Jeff Flake's last insistence on conducting an FBI investigation would be enough to calm down angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, a Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted, “It’s cold coming!” as Republicans in the Senate Hall were preparing to continue Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond all expectations,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say they’re already at a high level, which is true.
But they could be even higher, especially among women in suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, although they don't like the president, often don't run for election."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault by a Supreme Court justice candidate, analysts point out that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
“It’s a real mess for the Big Old Party,” Michael Steele, a former Republican National Committee chairman, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just a committee vote or a final vote, it's not a question of whether Kavanaugh was sent to the reserve bench, it's also about how Republicans got to it and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of the U.S.-based group Priorities, said in a statement.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about who they will trust after witnessing Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more leaning on him.
A new survey published by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in the truth of Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh is safe or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations that Ford has made, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that she was shown her genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that develops on the basis of Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose a place to store their data and people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee found that the intention behind Inrupt was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said, thinking of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own “personal network data storage” or POD.
It may contain contact lists, obligation lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that the decision about who can access what information is completely user-friendly.
This is what the company calls “personal data-enhancing”.
The idea for Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a contract to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, development engineers from around the world have been able to build their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which all of their business models would be completely reversed overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a press release on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate about net neutrality.
Even as Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the Distinction of Priests from the First World War with the Victoria Cross
The celebration in honor of the only priest of the Church of England who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter in World War I was commemorated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper and never found out he had received the greatest British military honor.
The memorial stone was discovered by two of his grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's undertaking for which he received this recognition.
According to the report of the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Channel of St. Quentin "through a very dense fog and under heavy fire that came from the direction of the battlefield and the machine".
He later rushed to the first ranks and with "incredibly bravery" led the squad forward before rushing to the Polish top without any help and burying three of the military ranks.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s works were “something I know I could never achieve, and that inspires humility.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the parade orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the bravery of a true hero shows through the support that many people will give."
Fans of mixed martial arts stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got Peppa Pigs.
Imagine this <0xCC><0xB6> staying up all night watching a series of Bellator 206 matches to make it impossible for you to track the main event.
The San Jose program featured 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the UK they aired live on Channel 5 at night.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for each other's match, viewers in the UK remained in shock when the broadcast was interrupted by Peppa Pig.
Many were not at all impressed after only staying up until early in the morning due to the fighting.
A fan of Twitter's children's cartoon break described it as "some kind of sick joke".
"According to state regulation, this content was not suitable for broadcasting at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Jupi, <0xE2><0x80><0x9B>Ask Peppa<0xE2><0x80><0x9B>."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said he would align his schedules to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“When I think about reprisals, I think we can probably fix something,” Coker said.
“But the transfer is there at six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to accomplish anything until Sunday comes to us, when there will already be a Monday with them.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the transmission was interrupted, there were a lot of copies that weren't even friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. The problem is the state nature.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six, which we're going to do. We tried to give more to our fans, but we exaggerated.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels “inferior” about sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality—but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said he was not aware that “everyone is not like me” until he went to high school.
In a statement to the Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights in order to give others "hope".
He also said his victory at the Olympics was less important since he became a father.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a stripper on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less valuable" to others during his growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity over others have been real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He says he wanted to prove he was "someone and something" so he wouldn't let anyone down when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medal has become a prominent person who advocates for LGBT people and has used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke in public because he believed he was happy that he could live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give others "hope".
A three-time world champion said he was surprised by falling in love with the man <0xC3><0xA2> American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an oscar, who was 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you’re so young you go through so much,” he said, referring to his first Olympic Games when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, saying that it was hard to find someone the same year without experiencing similar ups and downs.
In June, they became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "full perspective" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, the whole story would be about ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than the Olympic gold medals.
“Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was if they bought tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to be in the first place.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you're not going to be here long enough to be in the first place,'" he said.
"I held his hand while he was breathing, and only then when he stopped breathing and died did I finally become aware that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won bronze.
“All I knew was that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life – jumping in front of a domestic audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It was also an inspiration for the selection of the first song <0xCC><0x88> "Proud" singer Heather Small <0xCC><0x88> who performed in it during preparation for the Olympic Games and on which she always sat .
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to fully return to form to avoid an awkward turnaround.
Mickelson, who plays a record twelve times in this two-year competition, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the club in Saturday's four-ball and four-seater games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the United States, a five-time winner spent the day cheering and developing his game at the gym in the hope of correcting what is bothering him.
Never the most accurate player, not even at the top of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding Le Golf National, where a long uneven terrain routinely punishes inaccurate punches.
And if the field itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francescom Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who won all four games this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, come to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man <0xCC><0x88> more than that and could not say.
“He fully understood the role he had today, he patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“There’s a lot of confidence.”
He's famous and has contributed a lot to teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I figured there would be more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we should do it.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Falda's record on Sunday by the number of Ryder Cup matches played.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup that has never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence has also brought certain intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with people, and he’s a great guy for that,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than the game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of individual matches Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant race.
Danac made his debut in a game at Valderram in 1997, where Captain Seve Ballesterosa's team had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a tight difference of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 <0xC3><0x98> 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You always remember that we had a big advantage in Valderram; we had a big advantage in Golfline, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but with a tight difference," Bjorn said, after watching the team win in 2018 with a score of 5.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you will play with full force.
Get out on the field and do everything right.
Nothing's over until the floor is advertised on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
I talk all the time, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are well aware of who is standing against us – the greatest players in the world.”
Enthusiastic about the performance of his players on the hard golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run against the ore in this.
Tomorrow we have to face a different animal.
Tomorrow's the main individual performances, and that's something completely different.
It’s great to play with your partner when everything goes well, but when you’re there as an individual, at the end of the test are your golfer skills.
This is a message that you have to pass on to the players, and she is that tomorrow they have to give the best of themselves.
Now leave your partner because he has to give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they did with their fellow players, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those big turns last day, as he was part of a winning team in Brooklyn before ending up as a loser after Europe performed a "miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very start like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this advantage starts in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
Accordingly, we organized our squad and placed the boys as if we were, you know, trying to perform the magic tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead the counter-attack and confronts Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter face off against the other Europeans in the upper half.
I decided that this group of guys is going in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said of selected players for individual matches.
Germany's new warship is on standby
The German Navy's latest frigate was due to be launched in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but will not be ready until at least next year due to malfunctioning systems and cost increases, local media reported.
The launch of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the leading ship of all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, reports the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying problems after delivery hit the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, commissioned by the Navy back in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As it is known, it will have a strong top, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period <0xCC><0xB6> it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates over a period of up to two years without returning to the mother port.
However, constant delays mean that the most modern warships <0xCC><0xB6> that are said to allow Germany to display power abroad <0xCC><0x88> will already become obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
Last year, the F125 frigate hit all headlines, when the German Navy officially refused to let the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that would render the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be managed by crews of about 120<0xE2><0x88><0x92>1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 less than those of the older Bremen-class frigates.
Also, it has been shown that the ship is dramatically overweight, which reduces its efficiency and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is twice the weight of similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to improper hardware, the price of the entire project <0xCC><0x88> including crew training <0xCC><0x88> is also becoming a problem.
It is said that the price has reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) <0xCC><0xB6> compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Navy was actually "punching ships capable of deploying".
The official said the problem had increased over time, as the old ships were put out of service and there were no replacement ships.
He expressed regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class could join the navy.
The National Foundation Listens to the Secret Life of the Whistleblower
New research conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use landscape in hunting for food.
There is hope that the results will explain the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists at the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will be followed by ordinary and wet dwarf bats, as well as brown long-tailed and river bats in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the bat throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile inspections using handheld detectors.
A detailed analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the whistle vote and what kind it is.
Then a map of the habitat and the report will be created to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS's nature protection consultant, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help in determining the benefits of working on habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest surfaces for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by constructions and works on the layout that affect shelters and the loss of residence.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as well as mussels and certain chemical treatments of building material, and attacks on pet cats.
The schisms are not blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated eco-holication techniques to find bugs and obstacles on the way to their summer.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, inspection of the shelter and sometimes rescue.
The organisation has even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threada estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten species of bats that inhabit Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the property is an ideal area for them.
"We have a huge space for bats here at the Threave," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good homes.
However, there’s a lot more that we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and at other facilities will help us better understand what they need for progress.”
Stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting maintenance work inside the building, since the unintentional destruction of one leg can kill up to 400 women and young people, likely destroying the entire local population.
They are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative for the Scottish Association for the Protection of Mosquitoes, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their population progresses."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape as lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Cristiano Ronaldo has accused him of rape, which he described as “fake news,” saying people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers will be sued by the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was charged with raping an American named Kathryn Mayor in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 at the time to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers hours after the indictment, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the allegations as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” says the five-time Golden Ball winner in the camera.
“They want to be promoted using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” added the footballer with a smile.
Ronald’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they have called an “unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek compensation for “moral damage in the amount that corresponds to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in the last few years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the soccer player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99 percent" was "a good guy" that was ignored by that "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that he was in agreement.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and was photographed in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "feared of reprisals" and worried she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to cancel the deal because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve as part of a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million transfer.
Brexit: The UK will ‘forever regret’ what car manufacturers have lost
The UK will "always bow out" if it loses the status of world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK told the BBC that, in the event Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
A Japanese carmaker said the impact of waiting at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston <0xCC><0x88> engine, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis <0xCC><0x88> produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“It is my position that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will experience a production shutdown at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnastone.
Other car makers in the UK have expressed fears about leaving the EU without a deal due to possible consequences for cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is related to risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just-in-time" basis, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a disruption at the border that the industry says could lead to a delay and a shortage of parts.
Toyota at its Derbyshire plant couldn’t hold more stock than it needed for a day, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr Clark said the “Chequers” plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We have to agree. We want to achieve the best possible deal that will allow, as I say, not only to maintain the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers shows that we absolutely need to be able to continue this very successful range of supply chains.”
At Toyota, they could not say how long production could be halted, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnastone for 24 years and is a member of the United Trade Union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, after these jobs go away, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled for another week" as the fight for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the election, ties between Trump's associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question is whether Trump will fire a deputy state attorney, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, but for months he has been blowing up the tapes in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wire-carrying to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid the announcement that he would just resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't" like to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid overlap with a Senate Judiciary hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey For, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a unified FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's claims, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week, taking into account everything else that happens with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'll always love the press."
Some journalists would dispute the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of a press conference was not a result of reprisals against the "theatrical behavior" of television reporters, although she said: "I will not oppose the facts to be exchanged."
Then she announced that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president organizes more meetings to answer questions than any president before him,” she said, adding without giving any evidence: “We analyzed the numbers.”
Short talks will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to ask the question directly to the president of the United States, that’s infinitely better than talking to me.
“We’re trying to make that possible often, and you’ve been able to see it in the last few weeks, and it’s just that you can talk to the President of the United States that’s going to replace a brief address to reporters.”
Trump regularly gives answers to questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are very rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, a free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of assembled journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to EU workers at the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU staff at the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and desire to remain even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to pay the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal, which are moving towards the expected decisions this autumn, have continued.
But the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible scenario without a deal.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the contributions of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare services and help patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers line-up player Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after suffering a head injury in Saturday's loss to Vanderbilt Commodores with a score of 31<0xE2><0x81><0x84>27, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
“He came to the playground line and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put him on stretchers and sent him on further searches.
A representative of Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there are no "details on the type/range of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of playing experience, plays his first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five runs before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 runs in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom
According to the new plans of the Conservatives, foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help the homeless
This step will neutralize Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters.
The tax increase will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Riznica expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters by promising to provide more favorable housing solutions and focus on those with high wages.
The increase in tax will be charged by individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will contribute to government efforts in the fight against homelessness.
The additional fee <0xCC><0xB6> to be charged to the current fee, including an increase that was introduced two years ago to other homes and properties purchased for the purpose of issuing <0xCC><0x88> may be up to three per cent.
Riznica expects this move to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents who do not have a residence in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first property to join the company of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country <0xCC><0xB6> especially in the capital <0xCC><0xB6> have become "city of ghosts" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help more young people get to their first home.
He accused major construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking but not exploiting the country, and urged Mrs. May to give up quotas on affordable real estate in order to correct the “disgrace over the housing situation” in Britain.
Corbyn announced the proposal of a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and the end of nothing-caused delegations.
He also wants to give the Councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to the renewal of the British dream that the life of every new generation should be better.
And that means repairing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies established abroad, can buy homes easily as well as valuable Britons.

Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his “ultimate ambition” is one day to become Scotland’s manager.
Scott (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which currently occupies third place in the Premier League, with three points less than the leaders.
This summer he moved to the Light Stadium after he led St. Mirren again in the Scottish Football Championship last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it,” Ross told BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and that always pulled me back.
But this opportunity could only come true if I were successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors at the helm of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardycea, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Cania.
Former Alloa Athletica boss says he didn't feel fear because he inherited so well-known names in such a big club after he had previously rejected calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The success for me at this moment will be measured by whether I will be able to return this club to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club there again.”
Ross only completed the third year of his managerial career, after a period when he was an assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month experience as part of Heart's coaching staff.
He then helped Alloi recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of the fall to the title-winner next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” Alloe recalled taking over.
“I really believed that managing is what’s right for me, more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I did a good job, made a solid income, and enjoyed quite successful moments.
But the game can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management seems like the right thing to do.
I’ve always wanted to manage, and now I do. I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I’ve ever felt in my life.”

The perfect time for a pint is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, as research shows
The summer heat wave has increased revenue for British pubs that have struggled with finances, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that pubs and bars achieved an increase in revenue in July by 2.7 percent, but revenue in restaurants was reduced by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from the business consultation of the Office of the Chief Controller of Business Books, who collected the data, said: "Continuing the good weather and England's participation in the World Cup that lasted longer than expected meant that July would be more like the previous month of June, the last half of June.
The drop of 1.8 percent in restaurant revenue in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where mostly drinks are served have made much greater profits under the same conditions as the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where food is mostly served have also suffered from heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Apparently, people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed breweries and bars, beverage sales grew by 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, RSM’s holiday and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to selling on the foreign market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle with difficulties, although the drop in sales of 4.8 percent at the annual level will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
A long hot summer couldn’t come at a better time for the locals where food is served, and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August provide the much-needed respite.”
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the growth in the share of brands.
The sales tracking system in the Coffer Peach Tracker industry for the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses data on the efficiency of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and an industry reference value has been established.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents.
The study found that one in five children, some of whom are just 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
The news has raised fears about the release of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” account that shows their parents
One in five children, some of whom are just 11 years old, open secret accounts on social networks that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “false Insta” accounts – references to a photo-sharing website.
The news has heightened fears about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they use a clean “main” account to show their parents, while at the same time having private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website has found a teenager who has encouraged other words to “force me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC Conference of Independent Schools, showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 years have two profiles, half of whom admit to owning private accounts.
HMC boss Mike Buchanan said: “It’s mind-blowing that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the 'voice of an athlete' on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most distinguished Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to take advantage of her wide experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making him a member of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won a 200- and 400-meter race at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, out of his total four Olympic golds and is now a regular BBC expert, after a passing ischemic attack he could no longer walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was hard, but he completely recovered, he learned to walk again and today for the exercise of agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Opinions shared on the Internet about advertising for a traitor who compares mothers with cows
The publisher’s advertising company that mothers who breastfeed their children compares with the cows that encouraged the muse to share opinions on the Internet.
To mark the launch of a product that is claimed to be “the world’s first silent wearable digger,” consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom the new digger gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows with music whose lyrics read: “Yes, I muse myself, but you don’t see any tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed, this isn’t vime, it’s my breasts.”
Then there is the refrain: “Pump, pump, feed the baby, pump, pump, kiss your lady.”
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it illuminates the "horrific" dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except for stealing their children a few days after birth,” one person wrote.
Elvie's publisher discreetly fits into the breast pocket (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “Understanding traumatic for mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a cheater for mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone added: “Totally unnecessary advertising.”
Others defended the ad, in which one woman admitted that the song was “smiling.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The milk issue made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I realized it the way it is.
It’s a great product,” she said.
Another person commented: “This is a fun advertisement aimed at moms who give milk (often in their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like ‘the cow’.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with discreet traitors placed in the chest.
The concept of the campaign is based on the realization that many women who give milk say they feel like cows.
The Elvie traitor, however, is completely silent, has no wire or tube and discreetly fits into the breast pocket, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even go out during the betrayal.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother, commented: “The Elvie launcher is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
The real parallel between the portrayal of women and cows was meant to focus on betrayal and all its challenges, while at the same time in a fun and understandable way demonstrating an incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time that the traitor Elvie has reached the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion runway for designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased despite the fact that the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children under the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those previously arrested had not been recorded in criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors in the country are illegal, and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
Therefore, we continue to search for these individuals,” Mr Albence said.
According to the statements of the shelter workers, with the aim of speeding up the procedure for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, and not after 60 days, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear through a videoconference call, not personally, in order to bring their case to court for obtaining legal status.
Those who do not meet the criteria for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to the statements of the shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer the children remain in custody, it is more likely to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outcomes or attempts to escape.
Advocates said that these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, it is very likely that signs that the child is struggling will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to the tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to greet friends can cause a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would “follow suit with them and act accordingly.”
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, while millions have been left without their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "the fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared" of terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mostly exercise and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees not to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in restoring Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a massive attack by Syrian forces with the support of Russia on the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that the military action would be aimed at jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra front linked to al-Qaeda, “which will be eradicated.”
U.N. Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition soon to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and open the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the committee's work should be limited "to the revision of articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump should win the 2020 re-election unless, which many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the recall and the scandal end his presidency prematurely.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential final ever!”
There is currently no sign of a spectator's murder.
Since 2014, viewership in the strike term has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the strike term, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" surpassed the viewership with as many as 3.5 million viewers over the main news broadcast evenings.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” about a government secretary who becomes president after the Capitol-destroying attack.
Nell Scovell, author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
He recalled driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He said, "Because he's laughing at me," she told Mrs. Scovell.
There is a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the abortion law from Roe v. Wade’s lawsuit, whether immigrant families can reunite with the health of the global economy.
Excluding is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, you exceed the level of an informed citizen when you catch that for six hours you've been watching a group of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used sources of "deep background" for his book "Fear", about the coat of arms by Paul Manafort, about a $15,000 pip, and about a $50,000 pip, and a $15,000 pip.

He couldn't separate himself from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face to face with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung over.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.

The money from the outside slips into the most uncertain mid-term election race for Congress
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a surge of money, thanks to the congressional district reform that resulted in two candidates running for the same seat.
This newly remodeled district of Pittsburgh's suburban area highlights Democrat Conor Lamba, who won a seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is contesting against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th-old district, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The cards were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties had been unconstitutionally curtailed in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has launched a campaign-funding fight between the main party fundraisers, the Committee for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the widely followed special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
This position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the district with a 20-point lead.
Political analysts have given a slight advantage to democracies.
The U.S. should punish El Salvador for providing support to China, and then withdraw.
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varrell of Panama and owned a hotel in Panama until partners kicked out the Trump organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to invite U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore," spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
But the sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high rates of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar rally last year, which was seen as progress in efforts to prevent the movement of migrants.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held, effectively terminating any consideration of the punishment for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their report was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History (disambiguation)
The next draft could be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, which is now being widely available to the public.
Mr. Mueller has also reportedly directed his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of its attack on our elections.
If a majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibilities in that body, just as he prepares to appear again before the electorate, and perhaps eventually even with a jury of his peers.
There are many such "ifs" and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trum's fall is inevitable - not even those like him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, only that the West opposed and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflection, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans are now faced with several of these points of inflection.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspapers reported that he secretly proposed the recording of the president last year and speculated about his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the recently ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair—or if he has been confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?”
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for Congress, which Mr. Trump will call for accountability?
If we fall on these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's dream.
But I believe we won't fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime he once held in my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on that table with a cuckoo cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic about facing Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that their victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the G-League group.
The knee injury prevented a linker named Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season until a 2–2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game believing we could achieve something and we pulled the point.
We may have been able to steal the game in the end, but generally speaking, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
“Last year was definitely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and changes at the club itself, but now there’s some good feeling.
The guy is good and the guys really enjoy; the training is good.
Let's hope that we can continue now, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they want, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of Nationwide respondents said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to start the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for caring if you don’t express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to talk about where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay these costs.
Your choice of long-term care financing can include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with a monetary value that will help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own wealth – as long as you have money.
Organize your legal documents: In the root, prevent legal battles.
Hire health representatives to identify a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider giving full power to manage your finances.
You want to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure payment of your accounts if you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the tiny details: Imagine that your aging parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Enter the details in the written plan to be ready.
“It’s not just about finances, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep that plan in your hand."
Man shot several times from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times by air rifles while returning home after a night out.
The victim, in her forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a “sudden act.”
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a major earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pal on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Since communications were interrupted, aid officials could not obtain any information from the province of Donggale, areas north of Palua that are closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree quake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palua after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palou and Donggali, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Dongdala is a county that stretches for more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of the Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in the Dongli.
Tsunami also hit the western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A sudden earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the destruction of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the fall of the building.
2018: Large earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on family violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from the town of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaskan state police.
According to a police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su and remains on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where on the question of explanation of the crime, he stated "unfortunately, of course", the network reported.
The fuel is charged with three Class A offenses, which means it could be in jail for up to a year and punished with a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable by one day's imprisonment and a $2000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence, and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state linked to the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior with PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Friday.
The 7.5-degree quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Networks for electricity and communications have been discontinued, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck a direct proximity to central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, there are videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palou when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Seek Rare Death Penalty for Suspect of Terrorist Attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfulla Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York in which eight people have been killed – a rare punishment that hasn’t been carried out in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saip, 30, allegedly used a truck to rent a Home Depot store to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he had climbed pedestrians and cyclists who found him on the road in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these points lead to a possible death penalty, in accordance with the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury of Saipo hit a 22-point indictment that included eight counts of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors typically use in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “significant planning and preconceived thinking,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out as “offensive, cruel and corrupt.”
"Sayfullo Habibullahevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Encin<0xC3><0xAD>a Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drakea, Ariela Erlija, Hernana Ferruchija, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pag", Olejandra Umian Pag.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since New York’s Southern District last prosecuted the death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a federal case in New York in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of fasting in the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he was doing, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching ISIS videos on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, according to the indictment.
He also asked to carry out the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, police said.
He said he was not guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipo, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, not to accept the admission of life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative member of parliament says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to “mobilize the people’s army” during a protest at a Conservative conference.
The former leader of the United Kingdom's Independence Party said politicians had to "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics because one of Therese May's MPs suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would so far "come out" that Mr Farage was a Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faced in reconciling her deeply divided ranks is highlighted by the Tories tending to the remnants who join a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep her "Chequers" compromise plan in the middle of the attack by Brexit supporters and the rest of the EU.
The Allies insisted that she would continue efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the "Leave Means Leave" campaign rally in Solihull that he wanted to "reject the Chequers".
He proposed that Mr Farage should be given the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was the head, we would have been out by now," he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we must throw out the Chequers.”
Noting his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to bring our own laws into our country.”
Mr. Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British changed their opinion and that they wanted to stay is completely incorrect."
Conservative and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also on the run, addressing reporters with the words: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who actually were the ones who took to the streets and elected us.
Please reject the Chequers and start listening."
In a statement, May said, “The prime ministers retain their jobs when they deliver on their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians must be forced to "feel pressure" if they are prepared to ignore the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us – people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them, ‘You’re not going to get through this.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic public, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit, to feel pressure.
We are mobilizing the national army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the remnants marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A large number of activists have been smuggled by the Tories against Brexit following the group's launch this weekend.
Labourman Lord Adonis pleaded with the Conservatives for the security problems they experienced with the party's app during the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the ‘Canada plus plus’ plan, for the unrestricted state of the border, for the free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s all a farce.
“There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday at a direct social gathering with citizens in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It's been at the center of speculation for some time now that it could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
He asked her if she wanted to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means a woman at the head."
Arrested for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in a shooting with the death of Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims who took place on Friday.
Baton Rouge police have released information on the arrest of Dytheon Simpson (20), at 11 a.m., at a conference for ET journalists.
On Friday, they released a video of the murder, seeking help in identifying the man from the footage.
Sims (20) was killed early Friday near the University of Southern campus.
"Wayde Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result," Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, told the media on Saturday.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being at the scene of the crime and possessing the weapon and killing Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
Sims, a 3rd-year 198-cm high student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the top 10 last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world champion's title after his order secures victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that the team's order will "play a big role in the race".
From the starting position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went to boxing and left Hamilton to enter the market at first, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the boxing one lap later and exited behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the wheel-to-wheel action which left Ferrari's driver in dire danger of falling behind after a double move in defense of the third offense.
Max Verstappen started from the last row and was seventh to the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race as he gave up his tyres to reach a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally made it to boxing in the 44th round, but failed to accelerate his pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was hard because Valtteri had been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he was the real gentleman who let me through.
“The team has done a really great job to make a formation finish,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not publicly release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she accuses Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "evil and ugly and dishonest."
"The only thing that can happen is the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, ugly and dishonest," he said.
“When you look at publishing and leaking information to the public, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leave the information?
Remember her answers... did you leave the document in public – ‘ah, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let... No, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information had arrived from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I didn’t leave her story to the public,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep her a secret and I kept her a secret, which she asked for.”
However, her refusal did not come with the approval of the president, who at the meeting on Saturday night commented: "To tell you something - it was a very bad body speech.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defense of candidates for the Supreme Court, which three women have accused of sexual abuse, the president suggested that Democrats use these charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see the evil, the ugly, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they have to beat in order to get to power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5–3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars were looking forward to defeating Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday with a 5–3 win over Dundee on Saturday.
In the early minutes, the Giants came to the advantage of two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to equalization, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back into the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals from Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured the win.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who came from behind and defeated Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the two teams, and the Giants won in the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute, exactly 3:35, with Kendall McFaull's assist, with David Rutherford's assist to double the lead by beating Beauvillier four minutes later.
In the early opening of the game, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt enabled Cownie's equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure Giantsi finished the first third with the lead when he gave his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard led them once again to the equalization in the power measurement goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen for the first Dundee lead in the second third, and he took care of the win when his team was already halfway through the last third of the game.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, are the hosts of the Milton Keynes teams in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers in the plane avoid an earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic controller was declared a hero after he died while securing a safe flight with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have been washed away after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palua.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job at Mutiara Airport's Sis Al Jufri control tower, which was heavily rocking.
He remained to ensure the safe flight of the Batik Air aircraft on flight number 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports the Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palua.
“Our hearts are broken because of it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands of people, and the state disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Donggali, Sigis and Boutung is limited.
“It is believed that the death toll continues to rise, as many bodies are still in ruins, and many could not even come,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves, which reached a height of up to six meters, destroyed the Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency vehicles bring bodies every minute.
The government is running out of clean water.
There are small shops all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we don’t know what it will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pula on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man is being led as missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, which owns a plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now claims one man is being led as missing, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
In a statement, Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon, one of the passengers could not get on board.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an attempt to find the person in question.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers had been detained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
What caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
“That’s very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to break through the water that had dried up their waist to the exit in case of danger from the plane that sank.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming, and he suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who worked close to repairing the port also helped rescue by using a inflatable boat to transport people to the mainland before the plane sank in about 30 meters of water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in the accidents of PNG-registered air carriers in the past two decades, but none of them included Air Niugini.
An analyst exposes a weather review of the night in which a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor's office on Saturday ended the case in a retrial of a man who was charged with incendiary burning of a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The report described how he used data from his cell phone to agree to the move by the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which is contrary to his previous claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at a time when, according to his own claims, he was with a friend Michael Sanford, the police went to investigate Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "beat him because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The data from the cell phone indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis, some time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, calls, and contact information from the phone.
"He took it out of his life," Hale said.
The defense should start the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is an Enlightened Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to provoke a negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The band The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip-hop music has moved away from its beginnings filled with political messages and reflections on social issues.
They want to get back to their roots and make hip-hop again popular.
Artists such as Fugees and Commona are reborn in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
New York grandchild sues couple for cancellation after 'racist' message
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory termination after receiving a misdirected message from her mother calling her "one more black woman".
The couple deny that they are racists, comparing the accusation to “outrage.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction with her arrival on her first day of work in 2016 when she found out that her children's new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
“NEEE IS ONE MORE CRAZY,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in an "unpleasant" situation, and fired Mrs. Maurice, because, as she claims, their then-ex-grandmother, who was African-American, had done her job poorly, and that instead of her father, York had taken over from her father, Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for a severance payment and seeking compensation of $350 a day for a six-month period for which she was originally engaged, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that I can’t do such things,” she told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the claims that they were racists, saying that the termination of Mauricio's employment was reasonable to do, because of the fear that she would not be able to be trusted because of the insult afterwards.
“My wife didn’t think that she sent her a message.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“Would you trust your children to the person you were unfaithful to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on. "
Plasco said his wife was given only two months of maternity leave after the birth of the child and was in a “very difficult situation”.
"You're going to sue someone who's in a situation like this.
"That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the court proceedings are still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers would not identify with a talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who will read the book for the first time before publication.
It's very fun what we now know about Paddington's huge success."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a little stuffed bear to write a children's book, would be optimistic when his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was filled with happiness and sorrow after his death.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
“He was quite that guy and he wasn’t a cheerleader,” she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, everything felt like an achievement of his own child: you are proud of him, even though none of this is actually your work.
I think Paddington's success was watched that way.
Although it was about his work and his imagination, he always attributed the merit exclusively to Paddington."
My daughter died and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was urgently transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors were desperately trying to save her life.
“He regularly called to say it was really bad and to believe he wouldn’t get out,” Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
What I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
Medications given to her by doctors to maintain the heart's work slowly lost their effect and left her body system.
She died just before boarding, and then it all went away.
I just had to sit and wait knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything in me.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already saddened by the loss of her daughter at the time, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - who were unaware of the trials she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I lowered my head and my tears were pouring down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt a strong sense of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Messages of a woman in mourning on the bridge with the aim of preventing suicide
Two women who are left without loved ones for suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on the Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a chef with an infectious smile who had been waiting for a brilliant career.
“Everyone remembered him with his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy.”
However, before his death, he left the job because he was in “a really dark state.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that it will have a negative effect.”
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea with the cards “so that people know that there is someone you can go to and talk to, even if he is a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost her 15-year-old partner, Mark, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt sad, depressed, or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas he was at the very bottom <0xCC><0x88> when the children opened the gifts, he did not look them in the eyes nor wanted anything else."
She said his death was a great trauma to them, but that they had to overcome it: “It leaves a big hole in the family.
Whoa, whoa.
But we will continue to fight and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is coming to an end as FBI investigates
“I thought we might be able to bring in a little unity if we really managed to get something like what he was looking for – a time and scope limited investigation,” Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “disintegrate” amid a slump.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their trouble is driven by the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections come in just five weeks, on November 6 – if, as expected, Republicans do not go well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to bring the desired man to an election for the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush constantly invites senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
It will be voted in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break through with a decisive vote and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of refugees 'dropped' under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea fell after Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Referring to data from the U.S. Southern Alliance ministry, Park Byeong-seug said that last year there were 1,127 <0xCC><0x88> escapees compared to 2706 during 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors are tighter border control between North Korea and China and more charges that smugglers charge to people.
Pyongyang has not made a public comment.
The vast majority of refugees from the north eventually gained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South—which are still technically at war—have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in talks that focused on stalled denuclearization talks.
This came after a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broader sense to work to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for failing to make any progress since.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it does not take into account that under such circumstances we are the first to disarm ourselves,” Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unfit for service at the Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's candidate "hysterical" and said she was unable to serve in the Supreme Court because of her temperament.
Pelosi commented in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that a woman, if she ever behaved that way, would be called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said in a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied claims that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the introductory statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost screaming and choking as he discussed his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "a grotesque and co-ordinated smear" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved she could not participate in the Supreme Court's work because she showed prejudice against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself by making such statements and by the way he attacks Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Asked if he would try to repeal Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi shut down.
“I’ll say the following, if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not capable of not only being in the Supreme Court, but also not in the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v Wade Abortion Act because she is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings for confirmation, Kavanaugh asked whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
“It’s not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’” Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Justifiable criticism, anger that has accumulated for months and years—all of this can't be rid of without pay.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steine told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual. What do you think?"
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who used to be an executive director and who said that she was crying when she got angry, but she developed the technique that, when she gets angry and starts crying, the person she talks to says, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
And I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of the first jobs, in the office where men were dominated, was how, once when I was crying out for an unspeakable rage, an older woman—a cold manager I was always a little afraid of—happened to the stairs.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they'll think they've hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a foreign affair aboard the Monkey Business and pulled out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn’t need another one.
Someone called them "The Snowman and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already moved away, she was behind on fundraising, and vowed not to enter the race if she did not collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of the supporters, who gave men $1000, gave her only $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?” she asked.
While she said she was not going to launch a formal campaign, she was so obsessed with emotion and gratitude for the people who supported her, with frustration over the system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and with anger over sexism.
“You’d think I had experienced a nervous breakdown,” recalled Mrs. Schroeder’s reaction to the media.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what he'd put on my tombstone.
"She cried."
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The start of the U.S.-China trade war has stalled and, while the battle is far from over, the gap between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) of products, in fact taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing retaliated in some way each time, and recently imposed a tariff of five to ten percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to hit the US with a blow, and the world's second-largest economy will certainly not surrender soon.
Washington’s withdrawal could be achieved by dropping demands, but public submission to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war can provide positive support in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic strangulation in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed,” said Abigail Grace, a co-author of the Center’s strategic think tank.
Syria is ‘ready’ to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding the country that has been destroyed by a war lasting more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks in order to establish a normal situation.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were aimed at their daily lives and existence have now been met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in the restoration of a devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 <0xC3><0x98> 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for almost the entire tournament, sent the ball into the water at the first stroke, leaving the match to Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all rounds and has become one of the 4 players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the 1979 tournament started this format.
American Jordan Spietha kicked Thorbjorn Olesen out of Denmark, the lowest-ranked player on the European team, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, has lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the European with the most wins in the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop tears.
The year was tough.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy I won the cup again.
It’s all up to the team. I’m happy that I could help,” said Garcia, full of emotion after the European victory.
He passes the ball to his compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday won in individual games by the legendary American golfer, Tiger Woods, a result of 2&1.
“I’m incredibly proud of the victory over Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, and is right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finaw, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, U.S. captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At certain times, we have resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm wearing a hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to overdo it, I'm going to work with the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee, so we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take people off the hood.
We're overworked."
