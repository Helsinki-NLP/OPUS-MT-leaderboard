Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
This is a crazy place where young people are supposed to meet today.
A trench chapel where is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small farmers manage the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to days.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
Everyone knows this, who had to get excited because the car-navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas, an offer of the Bavarian Geoportal of the state government, are anything but current - but that is precisely why they are very informative.
Especially when you compare them to current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the wider area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bavarian Atlas is a patchwork carpet that is not recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called Urposition sheets, have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
These were created according to the Bavarian Surveying Administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.
Her client: Napoleon.
The French military leader has occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria – of course for military purposes.
Although the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: it was the present-day neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map.
Elector Max IV Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Authority.
The Urpositionsblatt f<0xC3><0xBC>r M<0xC3><0xBC>nchen dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek, like all others.
The comparison Before/Today is the most impressive on the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, as a district of Munich.
Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered tiles from the so-called "pre-recording", from which the basic tax was derived.
Small plots are no longer used by farmers there today - but by small farmers of the "Land in Sun" plant.
A large green area is distinguished north by undersending.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the venue of the Oktoberfest, was actually a meadow in the 19th century – and not concrete deserts.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt you can read not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the elevation "Auf der Luften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, people with crazy ideas were once blocked.
There the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer L<0xC3><0xBC>ften" was established in 1858/59.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the so-called Irren's complaint.
In addition, he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has been engaged in an exhibition with the facility.
For 280 patients, there was room at first, and later it was expanded to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient – the reason for the construction of the circular installation in Haar 1905.
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum M<0xC3><0xBC>nchen-Ost, one of Germany’s largest psychiatrists, has been located there since 2006.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people are now meeting in the Salesianum in Munich.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments.
Westly is the football pitch of TSV M<0xC3><0xBC>nchen Ost, east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015 the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural reference to the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed in World War II in bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was listed as "Maupt Platz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstra<0xC3><0x9F>e was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the Allied bombs broke many holes in the city centre.
A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval mining chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017 the stepping stone for the second S-Bahn line take place.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and the hole at the Marienhof fills up.
Civil Rights Group Releases Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to people of color who travel to Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to travel through the state and to allow extreme caution to occur in a series of questionable circumstances.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win complaints of discrimination, as well as the state’s law enforcement agencies, which aim disproportionately at minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warnings, the NAACP said.
“They have civil rights violations that happen to people.
They’re being stopped because of their skin color, they’re being beaten or killed,” said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP, to the Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints at such a frequency that we haven’t heard yet.”
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances early in the year after he no longer had gas during the state trip and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office, which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be detained than whites.
“The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People have to be willing to bring bail money or let their relatives know they’re traveling through the state.”
In 2015, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, which ranked the state in terms of the number of such violations in the country’s 16th rank.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states passed immigration laws, obliging local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU says will be used to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department to other countries, but recent interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Weidezaun project is elementary
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.
The CDU deputies Peter Wei<0xC3><0x9F> and Kordula Kovac took a picture on the spot.
Representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs at the Schwendemann family’s court.
Markus Schwendemann initially gave insight into his farm, where he farmed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplied 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated holiday guests in five apartments.
The "black forest milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
Only regionals come to the table of the holiday guests.
Since he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezaun project "elementally important".
I can't make a profit on such steep areas.
The green land area provides a lot of work, much needs to be processed with the engine sense.
“We have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography,” Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he did not run a bio farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is happy about the leader promotion".
At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that in order to allow the foresting of the areas could be extended for a long time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they will continue to operate," he said.
Farmers are often criticized for their support.
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced over the weideza promotion.
The open area is therefore 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be forested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of 71,500 euros, half were funded through leaders, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture.
“The big advantage is the durability of the fences,” Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac said, “You’re doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers, you’re not doing it.”
Peter Wei<0xC3><0x9F> also stated: “Best foods are produced here”.
The Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg Landscaping Directive (LPR) allows the state to promote pastures.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor belt designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be drag-and-drop manageable (increase above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by deforestation.
For the Fischerbach Weidezaun project 2018, the request is currently being made by eight participants with 24 parcels, who want to build almost 16 kilometers of fence.
The area of exposure is 35 hectares, the estimated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump’s White House is now taking over the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when you start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as much as any other – hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with CNN’s Jim Acosta about the president’s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have flattered him if he had done so.
But he attacked their significance, and in particular the significance attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base 17 years after the completion of the monument.
As Miller Acosta chimed, “I don’t want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller is actually right, but as he himself put it, it’s not really about history.
It’s about the contemporary response to the rousing words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: “Your tiredness, your poor, your oppressed masses who yearn for it, to free the poor, to breathe freely.”
There was never a time when the "poor waste" on our screens was better to see.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people in Trump’s United States are not welcome.
This conflict over the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is, in fact, a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus – and her friends, who were committed to putting their words at the base after their death – knew very well that they were carrying out a high-level political action.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a de-utilized classical figurative representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: the mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change that for a long time.
Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but rather is an early neoconservative who brings the American flame into the nightly world: “Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States."
It's pretty unusual for Limbaugh to have hit something here.
The significance of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted in seeing them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And of course, that’s not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch should not illuminate the way, but ignite the hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish team members from the UK
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
United Kingdom athletics chief executive Neil Black says the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad “will make a massive contribution to the team.”
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is being developed in Scotland" and the UK's athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we're going to continue it until we figure it out," Black said.
“I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the guy at the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it’s absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medallists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m line, while Eilidh Doyle was selected by the team to be the team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her Captain's speech was incredible," Black said.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or trained, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in was great."
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in her fifth world championships at the 400-m hurdles, says it’s “unbelievable” that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes in the World Cup so far was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle-distance runner Muir leads on this path and has set five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is yet another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scotsman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots not only belong to the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and in the finals.
“The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor to know that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me,” she added.
“Obviously, I’m very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on podiums.
What about my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it’s really important to focus on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it’s just going to be such a great atmosphere out there.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don’t apply for a public office if you can’t tolerate voter invoicing
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He hesitated in the criticism, for sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stupid, we are led like the sheep to battle."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
The governor’s staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with “Well, and?”
“It’s just Facebook,” many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is incredibly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation’s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and playfully debut his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking people coming to the governor’s side – which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees with public tax dollars – is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokesman Amelia Chase defended the governor’s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whips online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who talk to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not a troll.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and non-profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment section of the newscast "The Post".
“I don’t appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they’re misjudged by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens.”
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack", others would probably call "foreign language".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence protesters.
This is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for harassing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this issue fell in Virginia last week.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the era of affordable port had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers doubled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers joined his leadership.
And even then Washington had an anonymous troll.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with the United Kingdom overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project’s online papers.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, diversity of opinion and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led in the Archerfield Left side to the final round last year before losing to Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we’ll see how it achieves its glory with this event,” Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he set this place up.
He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It feels really special," said the Southport-based player.
“I couldn’t defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.”
Gary Orr, who arrived on the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“It always means a little more when you play at home,” said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I’m happy with how it went so far.”
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Less lung cancer caused by passive smoking
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
“According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths a year are due to passive smoking,” said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994.
At the time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove to be very complex
The construction works in Villinger Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e are in full swing and "are somewhat in time", according to the head of the building yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, as much is hidden in the underground, which is not noted in the plans.
Traffic, which constantly hinders construction work, is a major problem for the Stumpp company.
“The ignorance of the drivers of red lights and barrier grilles is already enormous,” reports Heinze.
The road is closed and only the bus lines are allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already quite exhausting.
But fortunately, we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt,” says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold Land
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the colloidal tube is removed and swallowed with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work, for example washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless space serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavy, and there are soldiers here.
“No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.,” she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public handshake before the occupying forces.
An existing movement that rose up for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island.
The journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour morning car rental.
There is no public transport.
The city, with about 19,000 inhabitants, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and corrugated roofs that have been converted by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing these clothes,” Degei says, pointing to her vibrant, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt, and her bright skirt.
"In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold land.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion worth of wood resources.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for Papuans, who ensure that Indonesia’s powerful military maintains a stifling presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papuan tribal highlands in the 1970s were genocide, according to the Asia-Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
“We Will Lose Everything” says in a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which contains reports of atrocities of the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture – rape and electric shocks are particularly popular, according to another report – and the brutal deuterbration.
“It’s difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened as Papua’s resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province’s population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the population-rich islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to stay here.
“Migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papuans,” said Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital.
“It cost the local Papuans – the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua – their market.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address the inequalities and violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former roommate secured 27 of Papua’s 29 districts – including Paniai – on his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel cheated.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored,” You says.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took the lead in her tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking were hunting and beating the group with their rifle pistons, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance – running in circles and imitating a bird song – from Papua’s Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began to sniff stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldier via an internal radio: “If the masses resist more than three times, they will shoot them dead,” it says in an official document from TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Jeremiah Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
“When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist,” he told TIME on the porch of his colorful wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, lots of shots were fired," he added.
The native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, who witnessed the shootings, was a witness.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said John, who, like many Indonesians, carries only one name, which TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they were attacked.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Papuan police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many others injured.
The news of the killings was only 'filtered' to Jakarta the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi held a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical grievances in Papua.
“I want this case to be resolved immediately, so it won’t happen again in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he had set up an out-of-court mechanism to address historic human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations, but there are processes that need to be carried out," he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “everything is regulated by law,” he said.
Wiranto, who has been charged by the UN for “crimes against humanity” demanding more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor’s bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been documented, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim disbelief.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress,” says John.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
“I’m scared,” he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
“After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me,” he says.
The shootings did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai's Deiyai neighborhood.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company’s location office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots at them.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
“We were so panicked, we’re afraid there will be revenge,” said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here.
"I hid in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and to withdraw the mobile police brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a nuisance to the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is also out of reach.
The people here build everything they eat: especially notes and fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papuans and new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own companies competitively.
“The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting by international media remain strained.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp were deported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi’s campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's restless eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbors of Papuas.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations and told reporters in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it is difficult to conceal the evidence of human rights cases."
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and pressed him "We want freedom", according to a source who also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
“Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Paniai shootings,” said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a rogue military, are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, regard their vote for Jokowi as a “guilty” that he must repay.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai victims performed one last symbolic act of mourning: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and military station.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they don’t let the perpetrators forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” Yacobus said with a lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for the second time
A fire found its way through one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-meter-high, 79-story building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house in just two years, which is accidentally called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the fire.
"We slept and we woke up at the fire alarm and when people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil protection authorities said the fire fighting units set the fire at around 4.00 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it is working on providing housing for the affected.
The incident can resurrect questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rises around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from cladding, exterior cladding to decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police said they believe the system of plates for insulation and cladding at London’s Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Further Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has met with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport was to play Davis Cup single on only two wins, not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, which are often very long, but also very appreciated for this reason, are thus preserved in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of member states voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was hardly missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions,” Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the applications.
Even after many objections, the proposal had already come to the vote to postpone the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: Thus, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host the first round in the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements for training places, etc. will be simplified and players will have to complete fewer official media deadlines before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travellers bring banned items to the plane, a survey finds
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent of items intentionally or unconsciously smuggled past the U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while carrying accidentally banned knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered late that they were travelling mistakenly with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people — conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. — also found that younger travelers were more likely to miss the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were Generation X members.
The most common objects that were intentionally bypassed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying objects with blades through security checks, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought prohibited drugs into the plane.
The company said it had asked travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods had been brought through airport security and how many had done it intentionally.
It’s no surprise that the people who carry the most smuggled goods – knowingly or unconsciously – were the ones who fly the most.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of it.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of the items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a long time, people thought that TSA could view books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel their order
Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far submitted that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has for the first time revealed a different, less glossy figure: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk has frequently offered more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay back the 1000 euros (in the US 1000 USD and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation deposit" completely.
There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk said in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, Tesla does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge for the ambitious growth targets lies not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 – all models combined – will be 500,000, 2020 will be one million.
The demand for it is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.
Those who order a "Model 3" today can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new, never-before-tested production roads without major interruptions with maximum exhaust.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, then the incompatibility of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company can not prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in scissors.
EPA chief Pruitt resigns for delaying Obama-era rules to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit that had been brought against his previous position in a federal appeals court.
It is a deadline for states to meet the 2015 standards for near-Earth ozone on October 1.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma’s attorney general before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone on to block or delay regulations that are opposed by the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for Pruitt’s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration that obliges oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his return to Ozone Standards simply reinforce the EPA’s willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
“Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waits to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation,” said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
“We don’t believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that it gives us seriously.”
However, the EPA’s statement said that Pruitt will at some point use its “authority to delay and all other legally available powers” to ensure that the regulations are “based on a sound policy and the best available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re-enactment of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Representatives of the public health and the environmentalists cheered on Pruitt’s surprising exchange rate.
“It’s worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the air protection manager we breathe in,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight against the Trump administration’s ideological crusade to turn to environmental polluters and their special interests.”
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm is invited to a serenade.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes, "It's a unique provincial quintessential."
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the W<0xC3><0xBC>rttembergese Urkundenbuch: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen, including the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
According to the wording of the document, on the hill of Tumling, besides the former parish church, there was also a ruling court, to which the church or the right of patronage belonged and not the other way around.
There were also people living there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamts Freudenstadt from 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still to be seen today in the local image of Tumlingen, was the "mountain" of the third, the ruling settlement core of the village.
Old maps from the time around the year 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.
Patronage law originated from early medieval church law.
A lord who built, equipped and occupied a church with a pastor continued to own this church and could also inherit this own church.
This was connected with the right to employ a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger ones of the two broke up at Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be issued later in the Second World War in 1942.
During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648), the window sills were struck and the bell cords were stolen.
The roof was leaky.
In 1796, French troops were stationed near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumling Hilarius Cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from H<0xC3><0xB6>rschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower tower that still exists today has been preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Retennern" as a successor to Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
As organisers, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens invite you to the St. Hilariuskapelle for the sixth serenade on the old cemetery on Sunday, July 16.
This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt K<0xC3><0xBC>bler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Entrance is from 3.30 p.m.
A roundabout takes place in front of the cemetery to balance the Serenade.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest", the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope that many supporters will be able to maintain the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for tummlings and eardrums.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as confirmed by Serenade organizer Walter Martini.
Association wants to have the approval of wind wheels checked
"Boisheim refuses" does not see a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council.
The association "Boisheim refuses" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawfully done.
The association argues that at the time of approval on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, since at that time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind energy plants are in principle possible, but at the same time, the concentration zone causes an exclusion of the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
These zones are intended to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier, due to a change in the land use plan, it had not approved the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf district government due to a form defect.
"Because of the lack of planning legal requirement, the approval decision issued is still unlawful and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of Boisheim's board of directors.
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the City Council has again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval by the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This excludes at this point the granting of a permit for the establishment of wind power plants by planning law".
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received from the district of Viersen since last week," a spokesman said.
The circle takes them on the occasion of re-examination of the matter.
However, they are not expected to cause the procedure to stop.
In view of ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the district did not want to express itself in content on Thursday to the argument of the association "Boisheim refuses".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning the construction of four wind turbines each 200 meters high on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is directly involved, had entered into a pact with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind power plants, the electricity needs of around 11,400 households can be covered - this corresponds to about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-seater households.
NEW Re aims to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer Viersens City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind energy plant in <0xC3><0x9C>bach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crash together: Woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at about 10 a.m. on the L 333 between low-wall manhole and bogel (Rhein-lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The road was closed for hours.
According to police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich with her car drove the L 333 in the direction of Bogel as a companion with her 53-year-old mother.
City and retailers plan "Home-Shops" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are due to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to attract residents to the shopping boom in the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian K<0xC3><0xB6>nig, announced, the "home-shopping" weekend is intended to raise awareness among customers about what offers the city has to offer away from the usual supermarket goods.
Accordingly, a market with regional providers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic companies are expected to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city center are to invite you to the "Midnight Shops".
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation, commercials are on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, according to Christian K<0xC3><0xB6>nig.
The city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
With this, the trade association and the city go to another stage of the project "Attractive city centre".
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the Fountain Festival as well as open-air Sunday, conversations with all businessmen and hosts to move them to active participation.
Attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be re-opened or re-opened.
These include tourists and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city center when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalizing the city centre - up to landlords, the businesses of the entire city and associations.
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network, which had partly widened, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in M<0xC3><0xBC>hlhausen, said that five Thuringian cities are participating for the first time on the third "home-shops" day nationwide.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, S<0xC3><0xB6>mmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should “advertise for the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities more strongly,” says Streig.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can directly influence his/her own environment with his/her purchasing behavior.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people have been injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine others injured, some of them heavy.
According to the fire department, another injured person was in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
At first, a missing person was also later found dead.
The dead were school employees.
As a result of the accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump put pressure on Mexico after leaked transcripts of phone calls due to border wall payments
Transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president mocked him for publicly attacking the wall and reportedly told him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump started his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia was to be taken "sad", "we" and "dumb" and that the existence of the trade, which was mediated by the Obama administration, would make him look like a "depp" after he banned the U.S. from surrounding areas.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Relaunch racist lynching as Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and crashed onto Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with guns to block its way.
The leader of the mob – a middle-aged man in a needle-striped suit – took a long train on his cigar and looked checking through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates swerved in fear.
"We want this n---- r Roger!" the man shouted.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams broke the silence when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22nd, is just a reenactment.
But then when a sling is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience came out with very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
“It’s really inconceivable that in all these years, not a single person has been arrested – even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the succession.
“It’s a dirt stain on a story, but it’s a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights lawyer.
For him, the adjustment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
“We want prosecution, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,” he said.
“We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.”
A court physician lays a bedcloth over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynx on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been on foot for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions across the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court made it possible for the black citizens of Georgia to cast their vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farm boy Roger Malcom ran a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Hester had slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But then as they moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynching mob surrounded the car.
“As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and arranged the murder,” concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, destroyed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks makes it even more pronounced.
“It was an election-right massacre,” he said.
They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: “If you register and if you vote, then this will happen to you here.”
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual reenactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Her portrayal is evident, grasping, and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many want to believe no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to look, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
“We don’t want to talk about lynching because then we will be confronted with its uglyness in all of us,” she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
Samples for this year’s production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors – a dozen white and the rest black – were pushed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-recorded overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He has played the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
“I feel dirty because I’m not,” Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this story alive because we don’t want to go back to those times.”
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcom, who yells at the horse and annoys him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n---he, disappear from my property!"
Rascona answers the fire.
There's a pause.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) bursts out laughing.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still quivering.
"I just don't think white people at the time said 'a--he'."
"Yes," joked one of the other black actors.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R'."
And that is where the energy shifts in the room, a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and with repressiveness.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning gown, stands over the corpses of the actors and performs Billie Holidays' grieving lobrede "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the road.
They have all experienced Georgia’s pressing humidity for nearly eight hours as Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now that you are standing in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song ring out, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the body name.
Children holler at their heads, register the fake blood and the still bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," murmured a little boy, as if he wanted to remember it.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynching rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then breaks into their arms crying, the emotional load of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
“We know it’s not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chats excited about the set-up with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance.
“It’s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do it because they look like you,” she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today it's just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone holds Brooks Hof at his table, he eats and remembers the civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the show next year.
“The adaptation is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horrors of what we have endured, but it’s also a moment of learning,” he said.
“It’s like if we don’t learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
He who does not study his own history, who does not know his own history, is condemned to repeat it."
"G<0xC3><0xB6>tterd<0xC3><0xA4>mmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf sets out on a colorful stage in front of a gigantic, six-story setting.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) optionally shows a shady street corner including Wall Rest and Donerbude in Berlin, a "plaste and elast" logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
There is an open Mercedes old-timer parked in front of it, where the reindeer girls pose as rockers, or alternatively an isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf’s guiding motif – money, power and greed – which is drawn by his “ring” staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), smashes a body into the trunk in Hollywood manner and gives the Kravallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the gloriously fizzy garden that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he hits Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Oak) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with a strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and Conductor Janowski, who humble themselves and bends their hands to the Merkel Raute.
There is great admiration for the festival orchestra, which shows up on stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in casual casual clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly awaited.
Had he still had to have a valid pipe concert in 2013, five years later there was great cheer in which the individual "buh" calls were made.
Festival director Katharina Wagner is expected to be pleased.
"It is noticed that the audience has grown up with the "ring" in a certain way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The public has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also grown an understanding of its way of thinking.
I have a positive summary.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
During their volunteer year, they work in several places.
Anywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
I have also been working in the school all day.
How are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
They are now 26 years old, so a late volunteer.
How's that coming?
A lot of people: I did an apprenticeship.
And then a construction engineering degree, let’s say, successfully completed.
I realized for myself that it’s wrong for me and I want to do something different, working with people.
And then I wondered what you were doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, then you can see how it really is on site, maybe in the focal point.
And was it so?
A lot of people: I’ve collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social sciences in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably in the Jugendamt Herne a social worker training and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not unusual to have several different places of employment during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from old age to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was the right thing to do.
I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Other than in engineering studies?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in mind who each have a very different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, or a teenager who has been taken out of the family - you always have to take care of it individually.
Very interesting.
And you weren't afraid of touch?
A: I’m not the type for that.
It is an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also times when there are negative moments, but life is like that.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and cuts dividend to revive business <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The British education group Pearson said on Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces.
The job cuts, which General Manager John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, come in addition to its previous restructuring, which already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, in a third cost reduction program, Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) to revive a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it achieved an increase of 1 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter have been injured, a NATO statement said.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were killed in the incident in Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month – on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement that the explosion took place on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an “improved explosive device carried by people”.
The statement said that all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh, is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombardment in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country’s deadliest militant attack since U.S.-led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs on increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the country’s military and police.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government, its policies, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA overturns decision to delay Smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration, according to which states are required to curb the smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push forward the so-called “Ozone Regulations 2015” and said it showed the agency’s commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA’s intention to delay ozone regulations – which are expected to measure pollutant emissions in a part of the country – to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards by October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the District of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s government has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says will boost economic growth.
Efforts, however, have triggered a backlash by Democrats and nature conservation groups, who are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA website says breathing air that contains ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
City Council wants community space
In the end, the decision was clear: by two votes in favour, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a community space in the future senior housing facility.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take until the area previously belonging to the church community is owned by the community, there is no longer a planning obstacle for the project to be voted by a private investor.
There is a debate on this with regard to a Community area.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council do not intend to provide such a community space as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the senior residence, but openly into the municipality.
As an example, the word "strickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which has already been advanced in the autumn of last fall by the provision of funds for the running budget, is sweetened by funding options.
The building is located in the refurbishment area.
The establishment of a common area would be eligible, Tjaden reports, with 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
The proposal is intended to signal to the investor that it is not intended to throw a knot between his legs in this regard, the finding that both saddle - which is attached to the environmental construction - and pull roof - would be possible, which would reduce the height of the trap and make the construction more economical - would be possible.
Needless to say, this is not just Wilfried Sohmer’s opinion.
If it helps: unanimously he passes the board.
It’s not so easy in the community.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings of her own, with which one does not get along so well, for this reason one now leans out of the window in the common room, she says: "I'm having a hard time with that."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely speaking out for the common area - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to any wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area, you do not give a grant, but get a real counter value, which can be marketed in case of doubt, is the opposite.
Mr Staiger's request to split the motion accordingly finds three advocates.
This is how the original program, which Stefan Haller summed up: "If we make the decision in this way, we are taking a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: cyclist is being dragged on the road
When crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car on Wednesday in Garath and seriously injured.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder was coming from Hilden at 12.20 p.m. with his bike on the bike path of the Schwarzer Weg from the direction of Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the highway at the height of the road at Buchholzer Busch.
A driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the long field was on the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic.
He collided with a car driven by a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was dragged to the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue vehicle.
FC Bayern Munich have to give up David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the game suck against Dortmund.
With personal care, FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the cup winner.
The staff worries at the German football record-champion Bayern M<0xC3><0xBC>nchen will be bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 hrs/ZDF and Eurosport) at the Borussia Dortmund Cup winner.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti has to give up David Alaba in duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
In addition, the Munichers Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the last six Test matches, Ancelotti has been responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
“We know we’re not in the best physical condition,” Ancelotti said, adding: “The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn’t good at the end.”
But the 58-year-old believes in a performance increase in the first official mandatory game of the season.
“Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who is expecting a "difficult, intense game".
The duel of the two German football heavyweights draws the fans in their ban.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) said on Friday.
Walking in the resin from star to star
In the resin, the first "star path" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in G<0xC3><0xB6>ttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it said.
It combines nature, science, movement and athletic performance.
Members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-reachable installations at five to six locations" in Oberharz.
Question came St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegei<0xC3><0x9F> and Sieber.
The information on the tables should be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Freedom of movement is also a criterion.
Later, the star path is to be extended by train.
“On the star path, the viewers learn a lot of knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars,” the association explained.
In addition, they learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more brightly than another, even though it lies much further away.
It will also tell you which constellation a selected star is in and when it is best to see.
Since 2014, the association has been operating in the Bergst<0xC3><0xA4>dtchen St. Andreasberg the highest observatory in northern Germany.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often from there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy with the naked eye can be seen clearly.
At the initiative of the Planetarium G<0xC3><0xB6>ttingen funding association, there has been something similar in the university city since 2003 to the planned starburst - the Planetenweg.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its stars leads up to the Hainberg and to the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (Gleichen municipality) with the planet Sedna.
The stars with the individual planets – including the end-point degraded Pluto to the dwarf planet – are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super featherweight champion.
After Garcia’s victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I'm up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go down on weight.
And he has to move on to lightweights [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Lukte.
“This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for it,” Garcia said, and later openly expressed herself fighting at the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready..."
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter", and he may be participating in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko held on to the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-match champion from Riverside looks "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out".
Garcia said the focus was to show hit strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
“This is the fight that needs to be fought.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four injured after tyre patch
In an accident on the A7, four people were partially seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira probably lost control of his vehicle at about 4.30 pm shortly before the connection point.
The car slid right into the wreckage, where it slid over and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partially seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked north for about an hour, then traffic on the left lane could be diverted to the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three-chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 start of the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation will bring points in aue.
With the first game of the season, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result too, the two opponents would not have been against Braunschweig in 2:2.
“There were two opponents too much, and we have to take better care of Aue,” says the defender from Fortuna D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge, the triple chain is also to be further optimized.
And a gate after a free kick does not want to catch the fortunes any more.
"For the future, it will be so that no one will stand on the line beside Michael."
Hoffmann is convinced that, even after his experience in the preparation, his team can cope better with the three-chain than with the four-chain.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is confident of his cause, "because we have players who can build well in the three-tier chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gie<0xC3><0x9F>elmann," Hoffmann said.
"The premise is, but that we harmonize even better and we don't make so many mistakes in building up."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
“But whether you can talk about a failed start after a disagreement is not known.
The performance could be perfectly fine,” Hoffmann said.
“But if we get four points on Sunday and can focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a decent start to the season.”
His coach didn’t want to know.
“I’m only judging the start to the season after six to eight game days,” said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn’t want to talk about an advantage over Aue, just because the game of the Sachsen in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely due to a weather accident.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher as they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorite in the bones.
“But they don’t know 100 percent where they are right now,” says Fortuna’s insider.
Although guests from the Rhineland go as an easy favorite on Sunday to the meeting in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
“The fact that we beat them off just because we have the right to be in the top six is silly,” says Funkel, whose record is quite positive in just one defeat against Aue out of nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga to beat from the start," Fortuna's head coach said.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant".
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players at all on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which were subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Agency for Forensic Medicine (R<0xC3><0xA4>ttsmedicinalverket) started conducting the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they are expected to make the assessment of the age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationverket) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, the Migration Agency has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was “possibly 18 years or older.”
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person “may be under 18 years of age”.
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
“We don’t see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant,” he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "promote that the subject is 18 years of age or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that they will be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing people’s biological maturity to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say for sure, we shouldn’t do it as if we could,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudgement of a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is that if the person is just under 18, in this case it’s about 10 percent.”
Full of Plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance to the town of Lauterbach.
“We’re very good at the time, it’s going great,” says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road Safety and Transport at the Freiburg Government Bureau.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of refurbishment.
The construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the schedule will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete arched bridge that is clad with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance to the town of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30-metre-wide bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning and seven tons of so-called bridge cap.
This is an edge fastening, which is also used as an operating path.
On the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
Then the walker's path will follow.
The special thing is that these are manufactured parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Special fingertip feeling required the laying of pipes through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by hand-letter.
In addition, fish and cancers had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building’s courtyard building and the collector’s walkway towards Schramberg, traffic is regulated one-way by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher town entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed.
The cost of the three bridge renovations together amounts to EUR 700,000.
The whole thing is funded by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter protest at German potato salad
It doesn’t happen so often that parties pull on one strand, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), comes together, which is otherwise just hard to put under a hat.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel are part of a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on this day, because the AfD invites Rondell in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle to the "great campaign drive" according to the poster.
And well-known names start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the federal election on 24 September, and the deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD students, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the town hall.
A colorful picture that comes with it.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the One World Forums and one of the key organizers, is really happy: "Great, how many people have gathered here".
There is music and plenty of food, including a "German potato salad that the AfD could eat without problems," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, she shows presence especially at the station, which is just a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Volcanoefel reported that he had made an effort to attend such an event and received the grant.
The 45-year-old from G<0xC3><0xB6>nnersdorf had initially requested parking in Daun, but there was a cancellation because of the already built Laurentiusskirmes.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is glad that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event on the Rondell square, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
At 8 p.m. on Rondellvorplatz, a band for entertainment will provide various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal chairman Beatrix von Storch to deliver their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes just over an hour, the guests in the front square have a longer breath, but also there is expected to clean up shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can back down - no special incidents.
Posaune meets Trumpet
A rehearsing with the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli will be held in the Haslacher Klosterkonzerte series tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the Klosterkirche.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or just "Balkan Folklore" meets a classical German training with roots in blast music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in top European orchestras.
So Petkov is a solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a soloist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to exceed the limits on their instruments, but also to merge the limits of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds with the two as in a new outfit, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by the jazz award-winning Nils Wogram, classics, jazz and free play blend into a fascinating ensemble.
This core piece of the programme was first presented this spring with great success in Freiburg.
Renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it for the rest of their lives.
But I want to try everything,” Kristen Stewart says openly about her bisexuality.
“When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, ‘Oh, that was cool, what comes next?’”
Perhaps the most famous relationship of the Hollywood star was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who ultimately turned out to be bitter.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assured the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I would have played it?”
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived and seriously believed in dualism.
It has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not to be taken seriously.”
She especially suffered from it, according to "Bang Showbiz", but during school time, when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a bub.
I felt really attacked, scared, and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, ‘Girl, be proud of you!’”
In particular, the public does not like to explain their love life: “People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself in front of the whole public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening in an announcement with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me,” Justice said.
“Today I will tell you with many prayers and many reflections ... today as a resident of West Virginia, I will tell you that I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor.”
The announcement broke out in jubilation.
“Tomorrow I will change my registration with the Republicans,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would say it’s time to play another game.”
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not approve Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about 1.59 billion dollars.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening saying, “Governor Justice’s party change is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again.”
“With only 15 governments and the control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice’s announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is top-down without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message,” RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.
Coe praises “honest” Russian apology for doping scandal
World athletics chief Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the time for the country to get back into the sport.
Russia’s athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country’s banishment from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who got away with gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re-designed."
Coe said he was also "satisfied" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to re-establish Russia," Coe said.
“We need to do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will join the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria as neutral players.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for a reset.
Drug tests are still insufficient and banned trainers are still free to work, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Grief act for soldiers killed in Mali
At a mourning ceremony in North Hessian Fritzlar, around 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures.
On the unsolved cause of the crash, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
However, she called the two deceased pilots "experts in their field".
“We bow to the highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany,” she said.
The 33-year-old major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from North Hesse were killed on Wednesday in West African Mali.
Her coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a death guard of the Bundeswehr in the Fritzlar Dom Sankt Peter.
At noon, only the members of the church said goodbye.
After that, the mourning ceremony in the circle of family, closest friends, of representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as of politics began.
Among them were Hesse Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The mourners laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm on the shoulders.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Minister of Defense von der Leyen described the soldiers killed as "highly decorated" and operational.
The chief of staff had built up the flight operations of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, to which the soldiers belong, also stated: "If this crew could not reverse the crash, then no one would have been able to."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Minister of the Leyen: the deployment is dangerous.
But he is also of high importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were taken out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Federal Armed Forces did not provide any information.
Prince Henry doesn’t want a grave next to his wife.
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henry (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was shared by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is attached to the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn N<0xC3><0xB8>rgaard has already prepared a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband’s decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henry is buried is still unclear.
However, he has no intention of being added to his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a mockery of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After the accession of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would like to become king.
In 2016 he retired, and he also finished the title "Prinzgemahl".
As Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted, he did not consider himself equal to his wife – even after his death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokesman of the Danish Royal House, explained.
Where the 83-year-old’s final resting place will be, is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be added to his French homeland, but to Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for for for the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French nobleman, Margrethe had met in London in 1965.
He worked at the Themse in the French Embassy.
While his later wife had always flown the expressions of sympathy of the people, Prince Henrik had a difficult position in his almost 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik stated about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of socks, Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and which had the reputation of being the brand of social-critical intellectuals in this country, I could not hope for posterity.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed of myself.
Those were two mistakes!”
Prime Minister Weil wants to speed up new elections
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Niedersachsen Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) has lost the red-green government majority for a quick re-election of the country's day, but he does not want to resign.
Because he spoke on Friday for the dissolution of Parliament.
Earlier, the surprise departure of a Green MP from their Landtag faction in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the national election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The former Green MP Elke Twesten founded her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (W<0xC3><0xBC>mme).
“I see my political future in the CDU,” she said Friday in Hannover.
CDU Group leader Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn Th<0xC3><0xBC>mler would like to recommend to his group that they be included.
CDU and FDP together had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Greene had 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on January 14 next year.
Thamler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the Landtag decides its self-dissolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its next move on Tuesday.
The National Constitution also provides for the possibility that the National Day will deprive the Prime Minister of trust and elect a successor.
“Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be legally examined cleanly," Thamler said.
"You will be able to discuss all questions in peace if they are legally examined."
Th<0xC3><0xBC>mler called Twesten's step "but somewhat curious".
The politician herself emphasized: "I'm not a traitor.
I feel very good.”
She described herself as a follower of black-green.
The Greens called on the absconding MPs to return their country's mandate.
“Of course, we assume that she will return her country day mandate, which she received via the green country list, with immediate effect,” said the country’s presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan K<0xC3><0xB6>rner.
The group chairman of the Greens, Anja Piel, said: "We are extremely sorry for the decision of each Twesten."
She consciously decided not to make a statement in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no substantive differences, we cannot follow through on this step."
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters, but also a betrayal of red-greens," the Federal President of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to re-elect the country’s national day quickly.
The exit costs two-thirds of the cost of red-green in Lower Saxony.
The politician “puts her personal interests before the welfare of the country in her hurt vanity and frustration,” SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil criticized.
"It's a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty intrigue game and trying to beat political capital out of it."
Niedersachsen CDU Group leader Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn Th<0xC3><0xBC>mler wants to recommend to his MP to include each Twesten in the CDU.
The head of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the results of the 2013 national election with personal career drunk.
The CDU was at that time the strongest force before the SPD, but SPD and Greene had a very thin majority of one vote on the national day.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is speaking and responding in an interview with the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
Mr. Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to take a close look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamping pressure.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg loads.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house immediately shut down and has since become aware of Germany’s influence in close exchange with the authorities of the countries.
All information and risk assessment is available to consumers.
Trade, as well as manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are transportable and health-conscious.
If the maximum residue level of 0.005mg/kg is exceeded for eggs, they are not transportable.
Unloaded eggs, however, can be sold and consumed.
This time, the companies are not to blame.
Do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, the production companies do not face any immediate debt.
Rather, they have to rely on economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers.
Is it just the staff or the final responsibility?
However, it was the official controls that uncovered the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out by 100 percent.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent clarification of such events and the transfer to the public prosecutor’s offices in cases where there may be criminal offences are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete clarification from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers and consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
If an unapproved insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
By the armored means, manufacturers, dealers and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the unlawful use of the insecticide fipronil in the attitude of food-producing animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts will be clarified quickly and without fail.
How football’s financial rules affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar’s world record transfer from Spain’s Barcelona to France’s Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the governing body that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar’s transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary of several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar signs and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding by Qatar’s energy-rich ruling family.
Associations may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must counteract with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debts in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – should become a tougher matter.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can incur losses amounting to 30 million euros.
And although Platini has fallen out of the presidency in 2015 in disgrace, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to work to deter excessive spending.
“For sure FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future,” Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a package, it can distribute the amount for the settlement over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the dividend amount for the next five years can be calculated at 44.4 million euros in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million fine (then $82 million) which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League stay limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to outsource their financial oversight by winding up their revenue by companies that are affiliated with the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this to be legitimate income.
That’s exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of PSA’s sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar via payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup.
But PSG and Qatar have argued that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver could be easy to find out for the UEFA regulatory authorities.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar’s transfer, the people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke on condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly annoyed to see one of the best football players go, and she tried to prevent Neymar’s departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
“It’s a clear case of ‘financial doping’ with the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar’s ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that finances a club.
“It’s the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“As soon as a country owns a club, anything is possible.
It’s going to be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country.”
Swiss is looking for a new shoe supplier
In the past few years, Chocolate Frey has produced chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Northwestern Switzerland" on Friday at the request of the news agency sda.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very pleased with the current supplier Chocolate Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Around 17 million small, red-and-white-packed, 14 grams of lead guitars are distributed to passengers by flight attendants each year before landing.
The Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwestern Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: For a shoe manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
How many applicants there are in the new tender, the Swiss do not want to betray.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to work on a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Chocolate tables have been distributed by Switzerland on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migros’ daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The possibility of placing the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolate Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, customers of the First Class will be pampered with delicacies from the Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli Confiserie, in the Business Class after passengers Schoggi von Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi also distributes Chocolat Frey on short distances, both in business and in Economy Class.
Athletics - discus Olympian Robert Harting reaches World Cup finals
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic winner, had failed in the national World Cup and could only watch the discus competition from the stands.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far, qualified for the final match.
Nostalgia in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is at the same time nostalgic due to the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s grunge era (when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, to give to Elizabeth and to her star bank, for 2001,
As a cultural artifact, it is both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stabbing themselves at the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny kids who grow up - they still managed to make it impossible to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the cast-can principle, including a riff on the 1990s Stalker films like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Rocks the Cradle").
At one point, a character stumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates, and “a number of other things from 1991.”
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet lost his virginity.
And there’s another crazy-bad plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now backed by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's underpants from "Singles", whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could warm up this franchise like a kind of recurring "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I take as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the band "How to Supret the Movie"
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-to-west ring fight iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas as director, claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-nosed Gregor and an idealistic Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on television, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo<0xC3><0xAB> Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.
In six long episodes, it moves on, and the comedy isn’t fast or frequent enough.
Comrade Detective, edited to a lesser length, could deliver his Agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men devouring a bunch of Hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can make everything a bedrock.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and with their own.
Battle of drug mafia in the country
The police have been successful in a coup against the Italian mafia in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the state prosecutor’s office Konstanz reported on Friday.
Fifteen defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued against them.
In addition, the officials secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested at the same time in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two Italians.
The two are therefore likely to be shipped to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
A total of over 300 police officers were deployed.
Members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder as well as robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the prosecutor’s office has been investigating Konstanz against organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a huge exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
In particular, Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia were put on the agenda of the investigations.
An incident on May 27 in H<0xC3><0xBC>fingen, where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning, is expected to go to the band’s account.
How to Regret Big Gaps in Foreigners Register
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the register of foreigners in Germany shows significant shortcomings.
This leads, in part, to serious misdecisions in asylum procedures.
The Federal Government’s refugee management officer, Frank-J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Weise, said in a media report that there were major gaps in the Federal Central Register.
Lacks in the data recorded there could lead to "partially serious failure decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, cautioned in an analysis that is available to the "South German newspaper".
According to the register, 10 million people of foreign nationality are recorded, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality has not been good in parts so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 have been found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register".
"Failure to enter data can slow down return processes significantly," the report said.
In addition, EU citizens are included in the statistics on people who have to travel abroad, who do not have to travel at all.
However, such misallocations led “to a distorted debate about the handling of travel agents,” the analysis said.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently begun sending refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy once they have entered from there.
This comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabr<0xC3><0xBC>cker Zeitung".
According to the paper, the BAMF is conducting such procedures "in relation to families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - to Italy again since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was practically no longer possible, the newspaper said, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees from the EU state are responsible for reaching them first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that state can send him back to the country of entry.
To justify this, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the accommodation capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, a spokesman for the left-wing group in the Bundestag, criticized the decision: “Families with children are at risk of human rights abuses and a threat to child welfare due to the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system.”
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach already made the blood donation service available to other people.
At least one out of the 12 people who received the award on Friday.
Above all, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Greule, who now shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the congregation at the meeting of the council of the municipality honors the multiple willingness to donate blood.
“It’s brilliant how our bodies are designed to do this and we should pay respect to donors who provide their blood for strangers, even if it’s useless,” said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
“A single blood donation helps several people,” said Holger Maisenbacher, the district director of the Deutsche Roten Kreuze (DRK), because the preservatives are broken down into their components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
“This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second-best result,” said the DRK circuit readiness manager.
Obviously, the move to the theater a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Sch<0xC3><0xB6>ck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many booked Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave up 500 milliliters of their juice ten times each.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation dampened speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "slow" as it kept interest rates on family income in the midst of increasing pressure.
The Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to nearly 3% in the fall.
But she signaled that in the next few years interest increases would be needed to curb Brexit-driven inflation, and she said credit costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
The members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammut economic package, which was issued a year after Brexit.
It will require time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funds to banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion more under this system – with <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on real household income continues to burden consumption."
Among the interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "somewhat larger" extent than the markets expect.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would take place "step by step" and "limited".
The Bank’s downward corrected growth forecasts for this and next year stand at 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the forecasts in May.
It maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after this news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and fell 0.4% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.11.
The decision does not change after the latest disappointing growth figures dampened the rising expectations for an increase in interest rates and GDP rose from 0,2 % in the second quarter to 0,3 % in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to reach 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly by the end of the year after the bank.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and low wage increases, as the exacerbation first gets even worse before it gets better.
She added that monetary policy in the next few years cannot "prevent income decline," but added that wages will recover "significantly" at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after the interest rates fell to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote, which caused the pound to drop.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank’s last ruling on interest rates, the reputation for interest rates had increased as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the bank said this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess in relation to its 2% target was “quite” attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders are looking for business loud and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where existing deals expire and new mortgages end, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular.”
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drugs to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken prior to sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He said he was willing to fund the process after the appeals court last year confirmed a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the authority to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an “important new intervention,” while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called it a “decisive moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to sign up, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in a person’s body to prevent an HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Among those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a GP can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.
The program will be <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week after an international competitive acquisition.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, how it is used, recorded and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overcome the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the ongoing progress of more than three decades in addressing one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive of NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at people in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We very much welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority now must be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP testing medicine has been acquired, we’re on our way to protecting more than 10,000 HIV-infected people.”
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is conducted as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will help us get one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society."
The Great Life: Intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, narrowed down from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
“Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room,” Joanne says.
“I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day.”
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a shady layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an intermediate floor to make the most of the spacious ceiling height.
“I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement,” she says.
For this purpose, she commissioned Erfan Azadi’s Duck & Shed architectural and design studio from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot-tall ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
“The steelworks are pretty complicated,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, it was about installing the steel so that it had the right height for the function up or down.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height on top of each other - with much additional drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses by Joanne.
By perceiving a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
“A bit of engineering went into it,” explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“At the end of the day, you’ll sell the land – or how your property is valued,” Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“Materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home,” Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased number of square meters from something standard to something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave them.
Brothers Struggle for a $500 Million Real Estate Empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are in an argument over one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million.
Former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp debate about the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, collected since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis’ portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.
After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets.
A court record says that this means Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul owns it worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in a 2015 first affidavit.
Last Friday, after several failed hearings, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled out.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
“My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
The costs will increase in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy and delicatessen businesses from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little kid (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their property kindly to their sons.
“Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis corporate group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the company and Luke $26 million.
Both Lukas and Mark are, Paul says, “became bitter about the conditions of their financial separation.”
Colin has held back a lot, although he was a former AFL board member and after a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by SMS to say “I really can’t say much” because the case is before the courts.
“It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family names through the courts,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother’s demands.
“Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute,” he said, adding that he “still hoped for a solution.”
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
“Our case will be resolved by the courts in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to limit the president’s media abstention.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the White House's new chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the chief on a more even course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior officials on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that comes into the president’s hands.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he’s in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
“If candidate Trump was upset about an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting from positions that were convincing,” Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser to Politico, told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise price.”
- Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we others don’t know – that Trump’s tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions.
We’ll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump hasn’t sent.
If his employees have already managed to keep trouble away from him a few times, then their efforts have earned it.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from engendering controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House that is made up of competing parties are repeatedly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - fully engaged in this story - reported in May on the preference of the advisers to provide the President with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press releases, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is staunch about figuring out where these come from.
That’s exactly what happened in late February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being “the source behind a bunch of leaks” in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to harassment or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had falsely accused her in the past and revoked her.
Trump read the article and began questioning employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives".
How'd that work out?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the assistance of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards this summer to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the wanted heavy criminals are not known, of course, evidence from the population is expected and requested.
On Friday, Europol reported on the action that follows the “EU Most Wanted” Advent calendar from winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, it was called by Europol.
We have compiled 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online searches have so far been arrested, at least 11 of them due to post-publication information on the website.
Travelers negotiate a trench and return to the 'Millionaires series'
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are back with some determined travelers at war who have negotiated a trench pulled from the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside of a wealthy street of Solihull called the "Millionaires Series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out only in May, but were not deterred by a trench dug by the council to prevent their raids.
The tactile group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Curious residents have harassed the council of Solihull, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: “They moved there on Monday evening after being sent by Bentley Heath where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame to implement, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
Travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More came in last night, probably even more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long lessons to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I’m not happy to continue to pay my community tax if the council can’t even stop that.”
A resident who did not want to be named said, "It's ridiculous that we've just seen the last round of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you’ve even seen a horse in the parking lot.”
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull Police to take the necessary legal steps to move them forward as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Birkenhof Hotel becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Birkenhof Hotel by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenues from the court tax.
In the autumn of 2014, given the dramatic increase in the number of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation, which led to controversial discussions.
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed in the municipal council at the time.
But especially the mayor of Freudenstadt, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel’s location and spoke of serious interest in the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with its managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Birkenhof Hotel at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a three-star plus-category house again under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadter Object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Birkenhof Hotel, there have been building shed containers in front of the entrance for a long time, and once you enter the house, it will be clear how extensive renovation work is being done.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially demolished, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do until March.
“It’s actually a nice hotel,” Thomas Scherer says in a conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautiful citizen", as Thomas Schererer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
A swimming pool, a spa area and a meeting room are among the facilities.
One does not want to position oneself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at a high level of downtown, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise, with about 60 rooms, wants to expand, explains Scherer.
Both individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The views of the city are the same as those of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to establish himself exactly.
Just under a million dollars, he said.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to Vordermann, which is already clearly visible.
In an inner courtyard there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia case: US Special Investigator sets up Grand Jury
In the Russia affair about U.S. President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called grand jury after a report.
The board has taken up the work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote on behalf of people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper assessed the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
The broadcaster CNN reported that there are already initial allegations by the board in connection with a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of interfering specifically in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were deals between Trump’s campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation is expected to focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republican in the campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more of Trump’s private and business environment under wraps.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that Special Investigator Trump had personally stepped into the center and investigated the charge of whether the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine present evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to prosecute.
Grand jurys are therefore also called prosecution chambers.
They are usually turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The board can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor’s Office to invite persons to be taken into custody under oath.
According to CNN, allegations have already been made that revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those who participated in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then head of election campaign Paul Manafort were also in the conversation.
Law experts said on Thursday evening on U.S. television that the deployment shows that Mueller is not intimidated by his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end in order to decide on the prosecution.
Yet the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“Russia’s history is a total invention,” Trump said.
The theme gives Democrats a chance to “feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.”
His special adviser, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he knew nothing about the establishment of a grand jury.
But this also usually works in secret, he stressed.
The White House supported any measures that accelerated the Special Investigator's work in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that he will not be prosecuted against the president.
There is no reason to assume that something has changed about this, the statement continued.
But Mueller was only hired after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this dismissal, allegations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to obstruct the justice system.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigations against former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under a lot of pressure because of the investigation.
After the presentation of U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his staff.
This sparked speculation as to whether Trump wanted to fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent special investigator of Congress, such as in the Watergate affair with late President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the president’s urgings by the Justice Department.
However, several senators from both parties want to avoid such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators tabled bills on Thursday, according to which the special investigator could no longer be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Giant Iceberg Drives in Antarctica <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In the West Antarctica, a giant iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has dissolved from the ice sheet.
This was shared by the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs over a trillion tons and is 5,800 square kilometers, is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants to have registered researchers in the past three decades.
A danger to people does not come from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the break-up of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
In total, however, there have been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for about 30 years, writes the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact-based context.
According to many researchers, this may be related to global warming.
The now-broken colossus was so far part of the Larsen-C shellfish.
Shellfish swim on the sea and are fed by large glaciers.
As a result, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen C Shellfish is located almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula in southern South America.
North of this ice sheet, the balance of growth and decline had been disturbed a few years ago.
A complete shellfish has been destroyed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot of talk about the fact that the Larsen C shellfish is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is now.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and may break down if a piece breaks down at a key point.
Melting shale and iceberg does not increase sea levels as they swim on the water and displace as much water as it does after melting itself.
However, the loss of shale leads to the glaciers opening directly into the sea and being able to run off much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project to observe the Antarctic (Midas).
According to AWI, the Larsen C Shellfish is the fourth largest shellfish in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters.
It breaks down regularly there.
“Although it’s a natural event and we’re not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position,” said Martin O’Leary of Swansea University.
"This is the largest withdrawal since the beginning of the recordings," he said.
Among scientists is disputed whether the Larsen-C shellfish will now grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding: “Our models say it will be less stable.”
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not trace the break-up of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the fastest-growing regions in the world.
CDU wants to pay for staff
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is demanding to exit the Employers’ Association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the district has won 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now, 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them.
The teaching places at the circle are obviously very desirable.
Around 620 applications were to be registered for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 unoccupied places at the Mettmann circle.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and counteract the lack of professionals in the administration.
The management shall, at the request of the parties, "develop a concept for staffing and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of professionals, but also to counteract the applicant shortage in the future, it says.
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented, show concrete measures for cross-country skiers and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were not known before.
Other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a real "competition of public employers".
In addition, a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
This is the highest time to act, so that no more jobs are left unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter V<0xC3><0xB6>lker, the CDU’s group leader, is still going beyond the joint request with his party.
He recently made a big surprise on the circuit day, when he publicly questioned the personnel cost coverage and stunned the rest of the parties.
Peoples want to check all the possibilities that make it possible to leave the municipal employer association.
"If we do not come here in the short term to a satisfactory solution, the district administration with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the district-owned cities - should aim for a house tariff," V<0xC3><0xB6>lker said.
Thus, the CDU tries to pay employees and officials better than it actually provides for the public service tariff.
The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, there are increases or more money only if you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up, in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy strengthens the tone of NGO-migrating rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue to do so if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations.
“If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti’s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German relief organisation ‘Jugend Rettet’ because their team had effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way that made illegal immigration easier.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the detailed allegations made by the Italian public prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue zone," the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We can assess all the charges currently being brought only after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Saved', which Iuventa has been monitoring since October.
It is suspected that his crew will take on board hoseboat migrants, which will be delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor’s file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of circumventing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must first of all have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue efforts have so far declared themselves willing to stick to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring “substantial changes or impediments” to their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize-winning organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperate with the local mayors have borne fruit.
“In the last few days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe.
Rises and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and attractions.
For this, three friendly guides were available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome addition.
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
There were following viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Palatinate forest and the pre-arranged levels.
In the meantime, there were always longer increases, for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad D<0xC3><0xBC>rkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the viewpoint was at a point of view, connected by "floating" trials and moderate increases.
During the last two days many meters of altitude were again reached.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and entrance huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad D<0xC3><0xBC>rkheim, the bikers breathe in healing soles in the open air inhaler.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had met the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporty and culturally.
Console instead of lawns - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sports
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of fighting through wind and weather over the stadium lawns?
The fact is: e-sports has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business – including big stars, millions of fans and huge high-gauge tournaments.
This has also been recognized by the first federal league associations, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
The beginning was made in 2015 by VfL Wolfsburg, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and lastly by VfB Stuttgart, who in mid-July founded an esports department and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
“We hope that this will inspire entirely new young target groups for the VfB,” says Executive Board Jochen R<0xC3><0xB6>ttgermann.
He is certain that "there will be several more clubs on this train".
Next weekend, FIFA will host the first “Interactive Club World Cup” in London, where players from different clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
“Real football has to deal with, in particular, the 14- to 30-year-olds, that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future,” the 52-year-old said.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sporters under contract, one could be present online far more often in these markets than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is it?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or FIFA football simulation are contested at competitive level.
Longest, as in normal sports, have established leagues in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
Is this a real sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly in need of habit.
Ingo Frob<0xC3><0xB6>se has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German University of Sport in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions, which are also found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, it needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should not only exercise on the console, but also train their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Frob<0xC3><0xB6>se also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls are difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are traveling internationally, which is like a large global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million had been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.
This is very little compared to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.4 billion in the Bundesliga.
However, e-sports is “not far from the other established sports like handball, basketball or ice hockey,” write the Deloitte consultants.
Internationally, many countries are still there.
Major markets are Asia and the United States, where former basketball player Shaquille O<0x60>Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is a lot going on in Europe too.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports has been introduced as a subject of instruction, says Frob<0xC3><0xB6>se.
In the Netherlands and France, the Football First League clubs are now obliged, according to Dutt, to set up an eSports department.
"In the European comparison, Germany lags behind," explains VfB board member R<0xC3><0xB6>ttgermann.
Just to fall into nostalgia, and to explain the old times, today is no longer enough.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market.
“We live in a digitalized world,” Dutt said.
“You can’t just say that everything stays the way it always was in football.”
Poison egg ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
In the meantime, almost all federal states are affected by the poison-laden egg scandal.
Aldi S<0xC3><0xBC>d and Aldi Nord reacted and took all the eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that do not contain fipronil are to be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter Sentenced for Texts Pushing Conrad Roy to Suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months behind bars and five years on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said on Thursday at the hearing: “My family is uncomfortable.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until the call.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands, and eyes facing downwards when she was convicted.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," the attorney general told the court.
"She ended her life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility,” she said.
"She showed no remorse".
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “terrible circumstance that they completely regret.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that their “age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions.”
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy’s mother Lynn Roy, who said that “there is no day when I will not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything, and I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all the pain that we will carry with us forever.”
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she would be "followed" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
“Not having this one person I’ve been with every day since my birth is a pain I’ll always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in 2014 from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.
The case drew national attention after Carter’s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
“Hand you up, jump off a building, impress yourself, I don’t know, there are many ways,” she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being released two years ago.
Ms Knox, 30, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new FC Bayern Mini-Lahm
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern have won the Confed Cup for a big season – extra motivation is not harmful.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even though the extra piece of clothing was very, very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup of course there was no Philipp Lahm and also no Manuel Neuer, he made the tie awarded to him stick to his arm.
“The coach didn’t announce it,” the Confed Cup winner told back after his first deployment as Bayern captain.
Well, the standings could have run better than the 0:2 against SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also mean Kimmich that way.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been selected as the play leader in the C-Elf, consisting of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come out of the holiday.
Sugar is best distributed to those you trust a lot, who you want to keep at bay.
So who was chosen to join the legacy of Lahm, can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed, “That’s what you want as a player: to take responsibility.”
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old floundered over the field as a mini-lahm.
Right back, that's his position now, the white tie on his arm did the rest.
And even in this starting formation, Kimmich acted like the one who can best take the rudder in hand.
He gave instructions, tried to lead the unplayed troop.
He had the whole view, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal by playing his lack of fitness (didn’t work); Renato Sanches by getting out on the devil to hook up with the performance of the Asian trip (did not work); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas S<0xC3><0xBC>le by making their first appearance in the Bavarian Trikot not to be negative.
After all, that worked very well.
S<0xC3><0xBC>le ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defence, both acting sovereign.
The notoriously occupied Napoli storm was often difficult, and S<0xC3><0xBC>le also tried to succeed a few times in the construction of the game.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "wasn't what we hoped for".
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Game shift, pace change: "For this style I was also picked up."
As unusual as this Bayern world is still for the newcomers, one was seen after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye to his new teammates after a couple of knock-out statements.
There he heard an interesting sentence from S<0xC3><0xBC>le: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game."
After all, he doesn’t have to teach the new.
Alaba Motivates <0xC3><0x96>FB Ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our <0xC3><0x96>FB ladies
Austria’s best-known footballer reported on Twitter just before the game and wished the <0xC3><0x96>FB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian Legionnaire is a club colleague of <0xC3><0x96>FB-Captain Schnaderbeck and fiebert with our ladies.
The Tweet of the Austrian Footballer of the Year and the Champions League winner should be a special motivational shot.
The famous Bayern-Dusel might also need our ladies well.
Business Satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy Praises Wissing's Tempo
It was often inconceivable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies in the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time speak to the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes on the wishes of the economy, which has blocked Lemke all".
The biggest turning point is Natus in infrastructure policy: The gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country’s priority list.
This year, the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure, until 2021 the construction law will stand.
A role in the plans of the country is also played by the Western Trier bypass, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Roadmap.
The goal is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says Ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a way to support regional but internationally competitive companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier, as inspired by Wissing, is aiming for a Rhineland-Palatinate wine label to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports declining for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees an additional incentive for young apprentices in the new Master Bonus, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A prize of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1000 is provided for the existing master’s examination and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2500 if graduates become self-employed within ten years of master’s training.
The homework list for the country, however, remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts can be quickly created, but at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers who want to hire Wissing at the state-run facility, only 29 have been employed so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to be given to external offices.
Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country will invest more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 less in obtaining state roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also refreshing to see the expansion of broadband in the country so far.
In 2016, regional companies had rated the power supply in an IHK survey only with the rating 3.4.
They complain about burgeoning internet connections and interruptions.
Ex-Economic Minister Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe – where after four months of disagreements, she was already clearing the field again.
Audi aims to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash
A day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company was of the opinion that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the business as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emission rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install plants to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of horrifying the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen’s mistakes, which were able to use so-called shutdown devices that regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but returned under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could put a heavy strain on Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen’s profits.
This message has the fleet on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
For the Isar visitors to join us, a fleet will sail through Munich on Saturday, which has a special message.
If you go back to the Isar on Saturday, you will see a large river between Flaucher and Reichenbach Bridge.
And this is not a regular fleet, with Isar tourists.
But the builder wants to clarify.
On the river you can see a large info-transparent.
It shows a garbage dump.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ...", the understanding of the Isar as a protected wildlife stream should be sharpened.
Already last summer the fleet drove over the Isar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's Knolls and the Laughing Against Suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoonists, the knot noses of his characters are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentine still draws and works on a film.
His message: laugh, “because there is too much suffering in the world.”
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, the son of a Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.
During his early years as an artist, he worked as an illustrator for greeting cards, which frustrated him.
“The happiest day of my professional life was the day I lost in my job,” he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he managed to break through the late 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures pile up in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he still sits at the sign table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, plush animals and watches, his droll characters continue to be widely distributed around the world.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand footer as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is scheduled to come to the cinema screen in 2019.
“I don’t know exactly what they’re going to say, it’s weird to me,” Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That’s why he prefers the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without words.
Lavender from Provence Threatened by Climate Change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to drought-remembering conditions and disease-transmitting insects, which prepares scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions for severe headaches.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only appeals to holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, “Instead of having very long plant horns with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
The solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slowing of evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rh<0xC3><0xB6>n celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Kr<0xC3><0xA4>mer, Z<0xC3><0xBC>fte, merchants, vagrants or a Landsknecht camp are to be experienced in the city centre these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children to the office, which in 2009 was the target of a grenade attack, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and abdominal feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartel, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no break from the violence, and while the bodies are burning across the country, there are more and more journalists involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and until now there have been at least two deaths this year.
Among the latter is its publisher and its inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violence.
His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Panazel, wear his glasses with their glasses, wear their glasses, and wear them.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the murders of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are uneasy and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, Ibarra says.
“It’s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop,” he says.
“As long as we don’t know why, we distrust everyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce newspaper office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve River".
The gunman drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two adult children.
Rumor has it that Culiacan is free to fly around.
But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn’t matter that every day in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot in the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug lords that are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of “quietness” when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is blamed for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman’s sons, was published.
This publication may have angered the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He served as an experienced reporter for Northeast in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for brave and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious “Maria Moors Cabot Award” for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take on the task that comes to you as a journalist – either that or you’re playing the fool.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could fly like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his ruin?
His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and how to stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret runways and runways to move drugs.
“These things were not allowed,” Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high level of self-control and self-restraint.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The annoyance is, Riodoce publisher Andres Villarreal said that "sense is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa—just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce’s employees met for security training, no phones were suddenly allowed. Days earlier it was announced that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40<0xC2><0xB0>C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half jokingly, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It’s been months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week’s issue, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an expo on state spending, which focused on the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the state attorney’s office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite location of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost all political levels for the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at this location, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.
Just a few months earlier, the readers would have considered the column of Valdez as the best informed source about the kidnapping.
"In the past, we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender physique.
"Now all the channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez’s office has been turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists because the employees have become something they themselves would never have expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist at the prosecutor’s office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing down in organized protests "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings.
On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington, D.C., where he tries to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez’s murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth.
She has since requested that she be reassigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "encouraged" by organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with the organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Articleulo 19" has blamed more than half of the attacks on police journalists and officials in the past year.
“In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut,” Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “Here I am because of my reports.”
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with a headline on the front page titled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country.
It is a painful decision.
It’s hard to find work in exile, and they’re still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as is apparent to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and keep working, it’s a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition had already been completed, Riodoce’s editors sat on the boulevard in front of the office and drank beer, as suddenly all their phones began to buzz.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.
From the edge of the curb, they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens were shouting nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the police officers who were keeping watch to see if they were ready.
If they were scared at all, they didn’t show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the newspaper’s fallen founder, whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, Riodoce’s employees followed in his footsteps.
"How can you just think about it," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street for coverage."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though a terrifying one.
Now, researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian mining worker have been so well received that experts have described it as “Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.”
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "disturbing past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" referred to him as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurier that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the Cretaceous.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant feeder is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He found something missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clumps.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
“If you blink a little bit with your eyes, you could almost believe it was asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant feeder, although covered with an armor and resembling a walking tank, was likely threatened by dinosaurs eating meat.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white shield to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shade, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its environment and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurian family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully discovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of sheds and armor over his body.
They discovered counter-escalation, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although counter-escalation is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today's living animals.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by dinosaurs who ate meat from sufficient pressure, that evolution favoured the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use counter-scattering - think of row, zebra or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
“Strong predator behaviors on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been in the Cretaceous period,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the sea floor.
At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
“The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just shine a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he's in bed."
The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, flesh-eating dinosaurs, standing on two legs, passed through the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk and mummified in mud after death.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the tail to the hip.
The creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long on average and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that rubbed off his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant feeder was swimming through western Canada until a flooded river floated into the open sea.
But the dinosaur’s underwater burial preserved his armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the H<0xC3><0xB8>reste still cover hollow tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a lottery win.
The more I see it, the more confusing it becomes.
The fossilized remains of the skin still cover the hollowed-out tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole.'
In the heat: Mass caramelization on A8: Many Injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car crash.
There are numerous injured, kilometre-long dams - and gaffes.
On the Stuttgart-M<0xC3><0xBC>nchen (A8) highway, about 20 people were injured in a mass car crash late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, around 5 p.m., nearly 30 vehicles, including trucks, were forced into each other during a thunderstorm between the junctions of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg County).
At first, there was no information on the exact number of the injured.
These are mild to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the accident site.
The A8 was completely blocked towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backscatter was formed about ten kilometers long.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive obstacles on the opposite track - due to numerous gaffers.
The fire department noted the characteristics of the vehicle handlebars, which can now be expected with sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 6:45 p.m., a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It’s a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: you don’t hesitate to sit on the train and sleep.
Or you are deeply into his work and just have a brilliant idea.
And then: puff.
Comes the creator and awakens a mischievous one or rips the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the uncreated ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and thus devalue the ticket.
Currently, a test operation is running on two routes.
“If the offer comes up, we’ll expand it.
It will then be expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany," said a railway spokesman.
"Comfort Check-in" the train calls the ticket evaluation without Schaffner.
In order to use them, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which is what most passengers already do anyway.
You must also have purchased it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking a ticket anyway.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call his ticket under "My tickets".
The test customers will then see a button for electronic devaluation.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant arrives at the ticket control in place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an online ticket that has already been rated.
You can continue to sleep, work, and remain silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel by our train crew without any ticket control, simply check in at the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal,” says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Televerkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document that you need to present is missing.
The result is endless discussions between train companion and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the department or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket, and the creator eventually takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question: “Whose Streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis-born sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
“The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it’s still on the road,” it said.
Confused that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle <0x40>TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was in the process of tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown’s lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
“That’s wild,” Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She dropped her phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father wearing a sign with the inscription, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed in which a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer secured his gun and shouted, "I'm going to kill you... all animals."
"This is not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"That's not the kind of murder we've gotten used to and that we can call typical."
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and crying.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in theaters from the 11th century.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience, which consists of the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning “about the black experience and the black state.”
“You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?” she recalled what she said.
“We’re going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn’t right.
I couldn't take them with me," Ferrell said later.
“What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past.
She must know it and see it and be drawn into it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and black constitution and what we need to do to become free in order to free ourselves.
Even though I’m lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn’t personally experience any eclectic racism, she’s no different than the next black woman child.
I feel like I would show her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station, which became a camp area when activists were waiting for the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
“My activism has completely changed since August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come."
A few weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film’s co-directors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
Ferrell came up with a question: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
This skepticism has been nurtured by countless cases of people, often whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't focus their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already collaborated with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the field who is known for his activism around the death penalty inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team from "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us, we speak," Davis said.
“That was the main thing for me how these people are portrayed, because that’s how I’ll be portrayed.”
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience — to show that the movement “is not about a Messiah leader, but about a community that comes together,” Folayan said — she proved to be the film’s most open participant.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly show personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
“I felt like naked,” Ferrell said, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
“But I understood that there has to be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.”
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who have shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify as gay.
“Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole,” Ferrell said, “and that’s why we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the main burden of everything.”
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really being maintained by black women and many black women".
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action", in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity.
“She was the person who stirred up that energy,” she said.
“It’s no coincidence that even though she was on the front line, there’s so much at stake in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "A Chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and feels committed to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
From "Dream" to "Gro<0xC3><0x9F>enwahn": TV readers discuss Bit Gallery
The bit-gallery moves people, even though it hasn’t been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping center at the south end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold is hardly one of them.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While the one to the bit gallery says: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really classy" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Need no man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Greatness!" (Lars Scholz).
While the proponents build on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, which also benefits the other businesses, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the site on which the Farm Market Hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of the construction work, this will be over.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - namely to the beda square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying almost weekly in the farm market hall for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the peasant women are always very fond of.
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is an opportunity to maintain this offer.
There are other cities as well.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "When direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery, it comes to the level of rent.
But it probably won’t be too low for the new project.”
Eva Kilic: "What about shopping malls in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There are enough of them in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here – some for months and years.
But since there is not even a decent weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least keep the market hall.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, shop shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Shame, there are almost no more special shops and what is left of them will probably disappear as well.”
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping center with a market hall does not fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmers market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit-gallery actually comes.
Or does the ghost bit-gallery manage to drive all the shops out of Bitburg before?”
George Marquet: “It just won’t work.
And a shopping center that's empty doesn't need anyone either.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer’s market, rather than this gallery.
But for a farm market hall, thanks to the insanely many - as I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg no longer have a place.
If the farm market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
An appropriate similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost inconspicuously the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst threw a 35-year prison sentence after she made classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website public.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming Similarity.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and leading dissident whose conviction was overturned by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits of what someone with these genomic data might look like, has a sharp, though somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the formability of DNA data—the many ways in which it can be interpreted—and the meaning of it.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly since her puberty about identifying herself as a woman, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning was visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butt and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg said in a press release of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letter friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic “Suppressed Images”, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which envisioned a future in which President Chelsea would transform judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama, just days after the book was published, would demand Manning’s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, second-rate ways to further ignite the rigid divisions he should actually resolve.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature on it (the "i" in her family name is endowed with a heart), called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand footer of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show, by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the artist’s highly developed scientific lexicon) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
“What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn’t care about who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are,” said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, also visible.
“DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that’s 30 of those stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novelle.
She shows Manning how she shows up with a hands-free phone from the U.S. disciplinary barracks like King-Kong.
“If they cold your speech, they’ve won,” he says.
"So never keep your mouth shut".
“It came straight from a letter she wrote to me,” said the artist, who hails from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not personally seen the exhibition – as it was predicted in the comic book – but if she should do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulators, which collide like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning's statue), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
“In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation.”
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University wanted for murder
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford who are wanted as suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as evidence from the Cook County District Court shows.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stabbings.
A community alert system released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stabbings as murder, while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now on leave and had been barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
“This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation,” said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. investigating authorities in any conceivable way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
“The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, who said something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very gruesome.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
The management team of Grand Plaza released a statement to residents: "The police are currently working on the victim's timeline and background and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
“At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA’s roadmap to comply with the code describing the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sports.
Speaking on the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we won’t admit anything that doesn’t exist.”
Mutko’s words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In a conversation with the Russian outlet RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one is willing to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
In November 2015, during the doping scandal, RUSADA was ruled out by WADA from carrying out doping controls in Russia.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization’s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is “moving in the right direction” to be re-entered.
Aldi no longer sells eggs
This was shared by the corporate groups.
This is a purely precautionary measure, it could be further assumed that there would be no harm to health, the statement said.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been tested negative for fipronil-containing anti-laser.
Aldi wants to bring clarity and transparency to its customers.
The startups that will help your business not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of your e-commerce start-up with your employees, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful, or – even worse – deceptive.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
“There simply never was consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to engage directly with and engage with whistleblowers.
“You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel over the three years Glint won.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results – so you can re-borrow why.
Companies come to realize that they need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so that you don’t become the next Uber to be involved in scandal since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, a startup convert that helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber crash in disbelief.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
And if the Chief Executive Officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
“The court of public opinion has caught up with regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to be treating its employees poorly or behaving unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation, and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that he or she was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems previously hidden from executives sitting in offices in cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices – can be identified and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience,” said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Group.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the “social media came to its right” that companies realized that they couldn’t prevent their dirty laundry going online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
“If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful,” said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who also uses Conver as Conver.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are committed and committed.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it’s no wonder you’ll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change doesn’t come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
“If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, president of consulting at Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies relying too much on collecting data.
“Because if you don’t follow, employees will ask themselves, ‘Did you really hear me?
You're gonna take care of that?
And if you don’t care, why should I?”
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, according to Erret.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganise several teams within the company through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, and to add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better binding of employees in an industry known for high sales.
“If you’re not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you’re going to lose people,” Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose companies.
NCAA Eliminates Two-Day Practices and Makes a Long Day for the Bruins
It starts at 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players are chatting on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their jersey tops and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour practice before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6:30 a.m.
"This is a real treadmill for the guys for the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and it has actually extended its days – at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three UCLA training sessions should begin at 7:15 p.m. to meet the players’ already completed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and performed practical exercises for the first time during Mora’s six seasons in Westwood during the summer school.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises during August, 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA’s rule change, even if it adds another point to players’ busy routes.
“We put this huge burden on them for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora said.
“And they’ve just pushed it through, they’re sticking around, they’re great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great."
The UCLA will end its practice once the camp is over, which, given the clear lines of view of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been pitched with footballs that cleared a safety net behind a landing post, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season.
“We will use our security,” Mora said.
“This is a real problem, and it’s not much to think that people rent a room there and then stop there to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it’s a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking lot 8.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
I don't worry too much about that.
We have a plan.”
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reports to third-party fact-checkers and then show their results under the original post, the world’s largest online social network said on Thursday. It’s one of its efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using up-to-date machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and send them to fact-checkers that may show the results of the fact-check from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe it has also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential election, and Germany is backing a plan to punish social media networks in September if they fail to do so quickly.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-check will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to realizing which stories of fact-checkers are being challenged by third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share,” said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook News in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "connected article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a Comic Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a slip-up for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mob-like Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
“I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years,” he says angrily.
“What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.”
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the time of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It’s not Rhodes’ first book based on an archive: he wrote Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library in 2014, a project he unexpectedly found emotionally.
“I only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a doppelganger in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins,” he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smelled like smoke, because at that time a fire was ignited because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he were there himself.
I love the archives!”
For someone who has been beaten with old papers in such a way that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I overestimated my welcome greetings a little bit") all this seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing the archives, and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries digging.
He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners, and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and began to write".
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees were just starting to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said, "Oh, throw it on the attic."
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who possessed what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to have fought for the two families.
Guys, let everything go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive deeper into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
“There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380 in this book entitled ‘Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex’,” says Rhodes.
“The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe they’re both connected?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is depicted staging his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Scotney's Rhodes' favorite family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite greedy, constantly making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women – I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to promote squirrels.”
After the end of his role in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic book about El<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>mm<0xC3><0xA4>ki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
“I was sad to go again,” he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to finish the damn life again."
Campaign started: Over 300-year-old Marienkapelle hidden in Rh<0xC3><0xB6>ndorf
With the unveiling of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rh<0xC3><0xB6>ndorf, the city of Bad Honnef on Friday launched its campaign to introduce a new roof brand (round view of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too beautiful for us.
Or?", the makers of the action since yesterday ask on the posters at the Rh<0xC3><0xB6>ndorfer Kapelle.
“We don’t really think that (of course!),” they wrote on their website.
"But we're using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that something is better than it seems.
Basically, we firmly believe that we, as Bad Honnefer citizens, know very well the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"It is a matter of formulating a one-of-a-kind promise, one that gives the city a distinctive one-of-a-kind setting feature."
Finally, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef has an average of five figures to pay for its new roof brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
At the beginning of August each year in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on pensions and transports in the officers’ corps.
So too this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as in the past, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
Under the chairmanship of the Head of Government, the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence, Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the consultations.
Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in excess.
The government is pulling the strings in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, President Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah G<0xC3><0xBC>len, whom Erdogan sees as a wire drawer of the coup attempt.
A total of 486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt have been negotiating in Ankara since this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had called the coup attempt a "gift of God", giving him the opportunity to "completely cleanse" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really have the army in hand?
At the end of February, the newspaper "H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet" published an article entitled "Unpleasantness in the military headquarters".
There are concerns in the general staff about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in lifting the ban on headhunting for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
The cleaning up of the army and the security forces goes on anyway.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered a further 7,395 civil servants to be fired by decree, including 2,303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had been blackmailing the military.
The generals used to be considered the real masters of the country.
Three times they called upon their role as guardians of the world order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the military’s power step by step, not least by invoking the European Union’s reform agenda.
Former officers say Erdogan is pushing ahead with a targeted Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer who after the coup attempt sought asylum for fear of persecution abroad warned the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this is the case, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
Without a doubt, in the alliance after the purges there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army to deploy.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are “weakened,” say NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It plans to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill is to be discussed in both chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries are issued green cards.”
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
“This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show the knowledge that will benefit our economy,” Trump said in a statement.
Ministry wants to repair track for race ladder hut
Over the past few months, there has been a dispute over the future of the race ladder hut - now it is supposed to go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is planned to be built on the rough track on which the tourist train runs.
In order to secure the future of the race ladder hut in the long term, construction work on the track is expected to begin this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and refurbish the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, which is particularly important for tourism," said Transport Secretary Klaus S<0xC3><0xBC>hl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route amounted to about 2.5 million euros.
Of this amount, the country accounts for 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finalized, S<0xC3><0xBC>hl declared.
The Ministry and the S<0xC3><0xBC>dth<0xC3><0xBC>ringen Bahn as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
“The timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated,” said S<0xC3><0xBC>hl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
The race ladder shuttle will be ordered on a regular basis in December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations, especially for tourists.
In the past months, in the course of a pilot operation, it has been tested whether the route is being used by enough people to order it again regularly in the future.
The route is also highly constructive in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just as you thought it couldn’t get any crazier in 2017, comes a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their ascent seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
“People are making fun of them, but companies are delivering a lot of it, and we’re going to get to see them even more often,” Mr Sharkey said in the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm – with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it gets even more worrisome as many robots own the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventure" personality.
“Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible,” says the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day – just like real people!
She may be tired, fixed to conversation, or she may be "in the mood"!
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female qualities, the hints of rape, when one steps on Frigid (i.e. here: resisting) to go to Farrah, calm down.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?"
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing refinements point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notices their increasing popularity, they still remain temporarily on the edge of consumer culture.
But what sifts through the fringes can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap, however, that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who has argued that women have been sexually assaulted.
The most frightening aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Magd Report') is not the graphic images, the smudged bodies and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (if even with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, that they mimic the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
You can't separate from your companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that points to independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are decent slaves.
Or to put it in the 2017 speech: Maids
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense.
It has become a bipartisan of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the U.S. with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s chosen relatives.
We're all trying to get our filter bubbles to burst.
Less noticed is Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been dealing with the Republicans in our family for a long time, has visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she had fought with for decades because of politics, is suddenly and completely weird on the same side.
Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it seems to me in another context that this also brings with it considerable risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the dismal effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the terrible possibility that his buttocks will one day no longer be repelled.
However, there is an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be a concept of reason compared to his standards.
I find myself struck by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney’s quirky version of the madman – the dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) – both of which actually appear to be a very mild crime compared to Trump.
If Trump goes, the next Republican candidate only has to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immense improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in New York Park, and the best three dollars you can spend in town if you don’t need any caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals twist to look fearfully over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: The views of tall buildings get old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not suit the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I’m still not quite through the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage – the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn’t count – but a great roundabout in the north of London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on and all have a great time.
If I had been able to rate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced in a department store to rate my “experience” with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% drink money - this to buy something over the store table.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is needed.
The poor woman in the department store was grinning apologizing, while I was tired of the experience of giving her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
For the second time, Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrists, which he reported to prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steinkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting at her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he considered his girlfriend to be a nocturnal intruder who was hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to file this time against Pistorius Appeal’s six-year prison sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Criminal Investigation Agency said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of increasing his sentence to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth graders from F<0xC3><0xBC>tzen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and into the further schools.
Three of the drop-out students will go to high school in the future, four to real school.
School principal Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the B<0xC3><0xBC>rgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
The 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle that grows up in the chicken farm, but is then released into the wild.
To this end, the munter Schar performed a musical entitled "The Eagle in the Chicken Court".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it burst out of his chickens.
Instead of a chicken coop, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken broke out, the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain and vanished.
After that, the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank’s study.
The hens danced with the young goggles that carried the cylinders to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (cows), but belongs to it.
He will never be like a chicken.
Its purpose is to be free.
She wanted every fourth grader to feel accepted into his new school.
A word of thanks followed to the colleagues, the former head of school Michael M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, who always jumps in at school dropouts, and the parents’ representatives.
The chicken season is over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She dismisses her students after two years of teaching only very reluctantly, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she was able to rely on the fourth graders.
In the end, all the students had a song of summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy in the children.
Eight first-year students have already been enrolled for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Foreign Ministry said, quoted by television as saying.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested by police in Sithonia.
They were released on the same day while an investigation is currently underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camp and impose significant fines on anyone found to remain in a place not intended for this purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What Affected People Need to Know Now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do Diesel Drivers Have to Participate in the Action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust gas behaviour of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and Euro 6 in part.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetatin from ACE Auto Club Europa comments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
“The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have foam software,” says Anja Smetatin.
Their retrofitting has been arranged by the Federal Office for the Carriage of Goods (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet named an exact date.
Daimler has announced to write to every person affected.
If, however, an inspection is due, this will be done within their framework.
How long should the refurbishment take in total?
“It’s hard to say,” Smetani said.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on the political pressure.
"Because we have seen, the car manufacturers have not voluntarily acted on the issue of the environment so far."
How long will the update take?
The refurbishment itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It may be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is likely that foreign producers would be attracted, according to Smetanain.
Is there a massive price drop in Euro-4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But just in the regions where driving bans are threatening.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesels.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the prize winners does not want to come – out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
This year, as the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographers Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honored.
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the ceremony with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear, who is known for his progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not attend the gala.
The New York Times said: “This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights – even to deprive them of the means – and that’s putting me under pressure.”
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her views.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former award winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach’s urban builder, will retire next year.
The job is already advertised - suitable applicants are rare though.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work still makes him a lot of fun, as he conveys in the press conference.
He reports on varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application meets the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the next possible time.
Thus, taking into account the regular cancellation periods, there should still be enough time for work.
Since Haslach acts as a lower building rights authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present appropriate conclusions.
This function will definitely keep the city.
If they could no longer fill them, the citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for advice.
But close proximity to citizens is important to the city and to himself, says Wacker, who reports of a good operating climate as well as a good mood between authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have gathered, looking back on the Wacker with pride.
"We make the city worth living", he is sure about the building office and its employees.
But also in the future, various projects are on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla-Areal and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
Only the latter will be hit with around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right", Wacker estimates.
“All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
There is a lot of room for a city builder.
With Haslach’s own building yard and gardening, you can react to many things quite flexibly.
“You can move a lot,” says Wacker, and the design of the green facilities is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the segregating city builder.
Without it, the city builder bears a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end everything runs over my table."
With care and coordination, he can count on long-time employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been with Manfred Sch<0xC3><0xB6>ner (Diefbau) for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."
Because continuity is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you would like to inherit Roland Wacker, according to the city of Haslach, you should be able to present a completed degree as a graduate engineer or bachelor with a specialist architecture and have good professional knowledge in the fields of construction planning and planning law.
The city building office is subject to high- and low-rise construction, construction planning, land acquisitions, management of urban properties, urban farm with building yard and urban gardening, as well as lower building rights authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: Southern railway track blocked
According to police, the unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the railway crossing in the area of Leobener Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the incoming freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators are looking for two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the hours of the night.
Close to the scene, witnesses had observed a rosy roller and a bicycle driver.
“This goes far beyond a loudspeaker line,” <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch told the APA.
The perpetrator or the perpetrator would have put themselves in great danger and also threatened the train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement traffic, there could also be penalties for rail customers.
All in all, it should be based on a “significant” amount, the spokesman said.
The damage was repaired again on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be carried out without hindrance.
Almost ten passenger trains were lost on Friday morning, two of which involved long-distance traffic.
Freight trains did not drop out, but they were delayed.
According to <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bleeding, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation, this can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have created a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells.”
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet promote more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal mucus if the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral fellow Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, which was housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the gut microbiomes of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice’s guts were DNA-sequencing and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells but without them missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a gut microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cell, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells formed.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid – without the bacteria – to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: “The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic has signed a "genie", Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Chelsea's 40 million-pound signing began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the holdout role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira advanced as they wanted.
However, Matic had been ruled out of the Blues' pre-season Asia tour and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a “fantastic job” to fulfill three of its four priority new commitments.
"Three out of four to get, I thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've worked hard."
Boeing "paints" dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew off from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner across the U.S., which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was to be the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing has done this kind of advertising before.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New deep stroke for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: when Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, the Social Democratic Prime Minister always looked to Berlin with some concern before the elections.
Just no fires from the party headquarters, just no counterwind from the alliance - that was the main wish of the voters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching the events in the SPD-run state capitals with growing anxiety.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counterwind.
It was a deep stroke.
One after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
“This shows once again: Red-green simply cannot govern reliably,” said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising group exit of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the national election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Green Federal Business Director Michael Kellner has called on the disgruntled Lower Saxon Green MP, Elke Twesten, to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the will of the electorate.
Every two-party party must immediately return its mandate," said the Federal Chief Executive Officer and the Green Party's election campaign leader to the editorial network Germany (RND).
“This may not be true at all,” a SPD campaigner sighs as the new hiobs message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is there after the green MPs have transferred each two to the CDU without their own government majority.
It is the temporary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what comes next.
Misery began with the unexpected clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no longer, the comrades at the time calmed down.
After the national elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
This was also the case – and things got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the limelight, the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf-Pleite slid the party smoothly.
In the weeks that followed, the comrades gathered again.
Then, when they had just created new courage, came the G-20 summit of Hamburg.
And with him came the next stroke.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned down.
And because in crisis communication after that he did pretty much everything wrong that one can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Now also Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust gas affair and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has long been in critical condition.
Miese surveys were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, because of the recent weeks, it has tried to put more and more emphasis on the alliance.
The ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden even from fellow citizens around Martin Schulz.
They let him go because they promised a stabilisation of the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Because there is basically no blame on the internal party dispute of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz is not.
Sometimes, therefore, the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here, above all, at the segregated parliamentarian Twesten.
“It is intolerable and damaging to democracy, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else,” says Matthias Miersch, head of the party in the SPD-Bundestagsfraction, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to Parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but via the list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MP continues.
The logical consequence would be that she would give back her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestag faction, laments an "undemocratic maneuver".
“The will of the electorate four years ago was clear: the people have made Stephan Weil the prime minister,” says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the Bundestag election, to the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member is falsifying the election result," Oppermann said.
He asked me to clarify the background.
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further promises from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding for local core III
Anyone who wants to renovate their home over the years will soon be able to get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG City Development informed about this on Wednesday in Recvingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave another look at what has happened so far.
Since 1991, there have been refurbishment areas in receptions.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the country of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg took over two thirds of the total funding.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - after all, it is important to promote interior development as well, and not just to open new construction sites.
On April 4th, the Karlsruhe Government Bureau received information that there will be a Renovation Zone III.
The total amount of funding is 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros came from the country, the rest from the municipality receiving.
How does a rehabilitation area come into being?
One will, Schindler continues, examine where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in rehabilitating in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then also be shifted again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-country program "Social City", within which the renovations would then be carried out.
At the core of the programme are the revitalization of urban areas, the improvement of living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out object-oriented, i.e. per plot.
The area of rehabilitation would eventually be defined as a statute.
The authorisation period for the funds will run from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September of this year, the inventory would only be carried out once, in the context of which those involved in the remediation area will receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, the resolution is expected to be adopted as soon as possible so that the renovations can begin in the coming year.
Pietzschmann subsequently stated that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is a matter of assessing the urban maladministration and deciding when and to what extent it is being rehabilitated.
For the respective property, a refurbishment mark will also be entered in the land register.
Pietzschmann himself will come to reception again and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Lands", which is concerned, among other things, with the construction condition and the refurbishment intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "budget and housing questionnaire", information on the size, distribution and inhabitants of a living room can be made.
The blue "operating arch" is only to be filled when business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously a request for funding.
In addition, new building measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funds will work according to the "wind dog principle" - who comes first, grinds first.
You can’t “reserve” funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown to make a renovation "tasteful" for the attendees.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come home and car with a hand motion
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand gesture.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, an anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra charge of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House’s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights U.S. manufacturing last month costs taxpayers, according to the military, who were left to the TIME magazine, up to $24,000.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was on display alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
“I just wanted you to be aware of this because it’s such an unusual event with high visibility,” the HMX-1 commander wrote to his commanding officer, the deputy naval commander for aviation on the eve of the event.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on 17 July at around 7 a.m. for the event at 3 p.m., and remained so long until the lawn was cleared between 18:00 and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of the hours of service.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground at the aircraft during the time.
From the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
“One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case,” the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're locked up," replied the deputy commander.
The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a boost to the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But requiring their use only for a photo op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the president’s plane performed taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the president’s plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made in America' show - showing products from all 50 states made by American workers with American materials," White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights in the Washington area and in the South Lawn to set off the US president in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event included the training needs of the flight crew for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said the taxpayers took over the charge for none of the other requisites presented at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to U.S. Department of Defense hourly rates for the fiscal year 2017, however, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24,380 USD per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below this rate.
“Determining the costs for taxpayers based on the estimates for the reimbursement rates is highly misleading,” Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance, and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At this time, the former White House press spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to present things that are made in America this week,” Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be contributing to our national security, and I expect hundreds, if not thousands, of people to depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver’s seat of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before tricky task
The top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga joins the table runner Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will arrive in Kiel tomorrow from 11 a.m. at the Tabledritten Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five games of still impeccable balance, the top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained the sense of reality.
Team boss Marius Zay has at least respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation.
I think the team is very good in the back positions.”
For class and stability at Suchsdorfer SV, imports from the high north are mainly concerned.
“These Danes and Finns can even refer to bets in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles,” says Zay, looking at Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson (Sweden), S<0xC3><0xB6>ren and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“This is going to be as hard for us as ever.
You also need a good portion of happiness.”
The new team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for Blue and White could be given to Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman, who is still active in the Challenger tournament in Biella in Italy, does not join the Bundesliga team, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) will make his first use this season at the tournament in Liberec.
The undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still at the ATP tournament in Kitzb<0xC3><0xBC>hel on the ball yesterday with the white Russian Andrei Vasilevski.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, M<0xC3><0xA1>té Valkusz could also return to the team.
Not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still number one in the Junior World Rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills up the squad.
How America can harm the OMV
Donald Trump wasn’t really happy when he signed into law on Wednesday evening to tighten sanctions against Russia.
“In his rush to pass the law,” he said, “Congress has packed in some “unconstitutional regulations.”
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels froze against the US advance.
After all, the draft foresees punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Accordingly, investors of the domestic OMV have since been concerned, which, together with other European companies, co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2.
The threat is huge.
However, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are at his disposal.
"The press" has looked at which could defend the group and which could really hurt it.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be the centerpiece of Netflix’s hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which Pablo Escobar’s Killer reveals, Netflix’s series is not over yet.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first of which received its first trailer and showed the latest evil weights of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the richest drug trade organization in the world: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful pawns, they operate “like a Fortune 500 company” only with more state bribery and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Roll back: The city hires 46 kitchen assistants
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself again.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the urban children's daycares.
By 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the urban children’s day care facilities (Kitas) again under its own control.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Aid, this is a good news: "We were all very pleased".
Cooked is still out of the house: a caterer takes on this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 children's daycares in the Krefeld area, in 44 children receive a warm meal at lunchtime.
Last year, 2,800 children were sitting at the tables, and the demand is constantly growing.
“Middle-aged people don’t just eat children who are cared for 45 hours a week in the Kita at noon,” Pommeranz explains.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care if children stay until 2 p.m."
46 part-time employees have kitchen service from September 1st: they heat the dishes served, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give out the food, clean off, rinse and clean the kitchen.
“The employees are firmly assigned to a kita,” Pommeranz says.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the amount of hours.
“The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the Kita team,” Pommeranz says.
“So they’re much more integrated and it’s easier for kit management to implement pedagogical concepts.”
This is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare the food".
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the kids.
“They have a known power in the Kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people.”
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be carried out in the future by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only the quality improvement of the kitchen performance, but also the charm that it has proved to be the most economical for the city in comparison with the cost between own management and foreign distribution.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are re-established.
“But these hours don’t weigh as much as about 750 people in the education sector,” says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will run in the provincial council elections. Three women run for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate unrestrictedly and are involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process that coincides with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, elections will hand over power peacefully from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further strengthen Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women from a total of 3.6 million registered voters are registered.

Men try to rob a 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolpingstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, at about 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to phone the girl’s cell phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl’s phone and necklace, but it failed.
Without loot, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
Investigations are ongoing.
GMB Concern over Investments at McVitie Factory in Glasgow
A union wants to make sure that Biscuit-manufacturer McVitie’s managers have a long-term commitment to production at their Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had remained silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which manufactures, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would “be the first to know” if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company’s branch manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie’s “to express concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines will not be advanced.”
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said, "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and the Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and wealth, and against the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie.”
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross has only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continued engagement with employees and trade union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business – and this applies to all of our business areas and locations – to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our Customs Cross location, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the legacy of Tollcross as a production site. Should our operations on site change, employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this."
Did PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not be left behind in her pursuit of Neymar after she has made an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record crash?
The sensational approach has warmed the transfer window this summer as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
After finishing, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive player and the world’s highest paid professional athlete. PSG offers salaries of more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president about this prospect?
When Manchester City announced interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG’s best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players to sign with them, it will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the internationals from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers to Neymar.
Roller tossed and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator intentionally overturned a roller set in the K<0xC3><0xB6>nigsfelder Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in front of the property number 30 and thus caused damage to the vehicle’s lining of the property of over 200 euros.
The Schramberg police, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, ask for information.
In an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car met him on his trail, the driver of a VW Touran had to escape and touched the dashboard.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW was on the B 215 from Stolzenau on his way to Leese.
In the area around Stolzenau a car came to him on his trail, so he had to escape to the right.
The Touran driver touched the steering wheel.
There was damage to the car.
The driver of the car, a Mercedes Benz, had taken over a truck and continued his journey without caring about the traffic accident.
According to the accident, it may be good that the Mercedes driver did not even notice the accident.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the car to contact the police station in Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the cases of abuse relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is the opinion of author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to provide for discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are the Church", declared after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects from the former Regensburg bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig M<0xC3><0xBC>ller as well as from the cathedral master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Emeritus Benedict XVI.
It would be of great use to the Catholic Church if M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret over their own omissions or their misapprehension of the proceedings at the time.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticized the "two-dimensional" measure in reporting on violence in the courts.
With regard to the raids in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are “shameful and shameful acts” that should be punished and prevented in the future; but the “degree of media manipulation” is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethnic.
“The habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public to consider it normal,” Scaraffia writes.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with Bavarian Radio: "You like to go to church and this is a found food".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "beats were a very normal educational means" to "get ready with naughty children, as I was one".
They found it unfair to apply today’s standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of abuse, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger also often appeared.
Totally wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who co-wrote with Ratzinger the commemorative band "My Brother the Pope" (translated in 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is stated in the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the Bishop of Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 Domspatzen.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, states: "In summary, therefore, it can be observed that in many cases, forms of physical and mental violence were used by Domkapellmeister R.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and thus, in many cases, despite violence, even connect positive memories with him.
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger, in his opinion, is relieved.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "accidents of violence on protective orders at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became hand-held when a Domspatz did not bring a top performance musically.
How do you rate this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.
He has just been given eight pages, and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of co-parenting or co-conspiracy in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at the preschool also took place outside of its sphere of influence.
You can at least accuse him of learning about it too late or not taking his first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzen gymnasium on which he worked was felt by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "salvation", "heaven" and "better world".
The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also presents a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warmhearted", "popular", "pure", "competent" and "understanding", as a very kind teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and sweets and "carried by children"
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has already led to outbursts of anger.
The fact that he not only banged chairs and threw the key bandage on the floor, but also distributed earplugs and pulled all too naughty boys to the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologised for it.
However, it must be said that such methods of education were widely used in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, in parents as well as teachers.
Do you also know such breeding methods?
Of course, I think each of us was born before 1968.
I also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what is actually in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence in pre-school, these are free baggage items.
One wonders if it has more to do with his fame and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him.
The Bavarian Pope is still working hard for many who have never understood him.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
The media reported a great deal in connection with the report on the topic of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also charged with any involvement or collusion with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Absolutely not.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have confided in the chaplain.
Not even the parents were invited.
“I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it,” one of the victims said, “I felt very embarrassed about it.”
The real problem with the clarification of sexual abuse was and still is that most victims are silent out of shame.
If they did not even trust their parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional manner.
How, then, do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger’s role in terms of abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A student in question put it this way: "With regard to sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I think it... even for really absurd to assume that they have opened up to him... Bubbies are more invasive or clear or even more open than to their parents, interns, trust teachers etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear result: "The fact that students concerned in advance and/or their environment were entrusted to him could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger must therefore be free from any co-conspiracy.
Nor can he be accused of not preventing him or being brought to the notice.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these reprehensible crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was much of "violence" to be read at the Regensburg cathedral courtyards.
Georg Ratzinger, the former head of the cathedral, is accused in the report "watching away".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That is indeed the big problem, that in the coverage everything was mixed and mixed into a huge mix of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
This is, in turn, an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violent acts, as well as, let’s say, other charges.
In addition, the report deals with events from the period since 1945, i.e. from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible pedagogy of beatings, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were properly harassed and maltreated and suffered terribly, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions had to have prevailed.
However, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got the boys face to face when they were already at Domspatzengymnasium.
On it, as most witnesses emphasize, the topic of "preschool" was taboo.
One was just happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different at Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.
This is also true of Georg Ratzinger, who concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even connect positive memories with him".
At the very least, the accusation of looking away remains.
Despite all the efforts, however, the report was only able to define two periods in which he was informed of the conditions at the preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just starting to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was just not acting and responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this, he points out that "the punishment of beatings will continue to be practiced in pre-school".
Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when beatings were also banned in Bavaria for a long time.
Before that, they happened in a legal gray zone, as we all probably know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
You can’t say he’s always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the punishment of beatings at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "fall of anachronism", that is, the danger of assessing the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times and also not to what was violated in pre-school on reprisals and violence on innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was customary at the time.
It’s all terrible and I’m glad it’s finally being worked out.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. pulling earplugs and on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg period did Georg Ratzinger reflect in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Did the subject of punishment come to the fore?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, since the doms played only one side role.
Nevertheless, I do not hide in any way that he led a strict regiment there.
But it must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand for absolute discipline, it would have been hardly possible for him to form from the hitherto nationally known Regensburg cathedrals an institution of world-class, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and of his musical tradition (1987) and of Japan, the two in the same tour.
With cookies and candy alone, you don’t make a big singer out of rebellious boys, and you are faced with every success, no matter in what field, but always discipline, passion and self-expression.
What kind of person have you experienced in the conversations with Georg Ratzinger about his book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well, and I have seen him again and again as wonderful, humorous, thorough, deeply faithful and heart-warming people, from whom one cannot imagine that he could do anything to hurt even a plane.
I regularly get along with how many former court clerks still today, 23 years after his emeritus, regularly contact him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once strict with them are, therefore, clearly in the minority.
Most of the judges are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but he was also a kind person of respect that they still look up to today and worship.
And please, once again very clearly: all that is alleged to him are methods of education that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be happy that we have overcome this time for a long time.
But it is most unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, into the media scapegoat.
The evil intention behind it is only too obvious.
The report, which has just been published, relieves him.
Now the court would order a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merit and, without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, to finally make peace.
