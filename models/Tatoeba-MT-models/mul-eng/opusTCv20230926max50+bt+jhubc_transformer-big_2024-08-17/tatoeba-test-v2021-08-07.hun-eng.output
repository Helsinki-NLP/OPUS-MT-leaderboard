I teach Chinese language.
It's like they're pouring water on me.
I slowly realized that I misunderstood her.

Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your trust in my direction.
This happened at the beginning of last week.
This is exactly what happened on our wedding day, dear.
There had to be a reason for that.

I thought you were him.
I've threatened to kill my neighbor.
It hurts!

I'm under his influence.
It had a huge impact on me.
It's a dangerous accident.
It's a historical play.
It's hard to get into the practice that we were talking about.
It's hard to please everyone.
It's hard to please everyone.
I have doubts as to whether it will work.
It's getting really late.
She's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It’s time to start a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
Basically, it's your fault.
He's in the kitchen.
That's wonderful!
It's south.
This is my bedroom.
We have to prepare for the future.
You need a little rest.
It's never too late to learn.
I'm glad to see you again.
It is not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke alarm can't be turned off.
That's not the best solution.
That's not the right solution.
It's no exaggeration to say he's a genius.
That's no secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This is not the 19th century.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It's not appropriate to talk with your mouth full.
It's airing.
He's still moving.
Wow, it's really bad weather today!
Baromi dear!
Thirty meters long.
Time to go to bed.
It's too easy for him.
It's your turn.
This is useful information.
The heat is high at night.

It just didn't work.
It's gonna be dangerous.
It'll be dark before we get home.
He'll be ready when he needs to.
He'll be ready when he has to.
It will take a while to get used to wearing glasses.
He'll get it soon.
It'll work if I change the polarizations.
As a result, it looks bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like I don't need it here.
You'd like a haircut.
Looks like you're not feeling well here.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what matters.
This could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
This can save your life.
Maybe we'd like to try it.
Maybe I'll be late.
You have to wash it.
You have to report something.
It must have been love.
I'm sure they've been stolen.
I have to fix it.
It never existed.
It should never have happened.
Despite that, I lied to him that I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do my best.
I told him to come.
I told Tomin not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I already told you I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like it, Tom.
I'd have a question, too.
I've been swimming for so long.
I've been in the bath for a long time.
I got it.
I was on Route 58.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the animal hospital yesterday.
I took off my shoes.
I totally forgot about it.
It would probably be cheaper elsewhere.
The rain fell last morning.
It happened yesterday.
It's a lot.
I work two hours a day.
I traveled all over Russia.
I've been to the United States cross-country.
It's actually working.
It's really sad.
I tried everything I could to keep him alive.
I tried to forget.
I was trying to help Tomin.
I love my life, too.
I'm trying to keep you informed.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a nice flag.
It's a big cat.
It's a little early for a drink, isn't it?
It's a boring word.
It's a comfortable situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, paper at least.
It's a gray stone building.
It's a pet dog.
It's half an hour before lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen.
It's completely dark outside.
It's all mine.
It's all right, it's over.
It's nice and good theory, but will it work in practice?
It's all your fault.
It's already 7:00.
It's already in progress.
It's already ten o'clock tonight.
One of my dreams has always been to live next to a stream.
It's always the same note.
It's an environmental disaster.
It's a spice business, Watson, a spice, a dangerous business, and the more I see, the less I like it.
What a shame!
Too bad I'm late.
Too bad Tommy's leaving.
It's a pretty big freak.
It's a nightmare.
It's ice.
It is as much art as it is science.
That's the past.
He's in school.
Very dangerous sport, where even a small mistake can lead to serious injury.

Money-spending.
That's a weird question.
That's terrible.
It's been a crazy week.
It was a long day.
It was an amazing journey.
It's a cold day.
It's a tough day today.

Firefighter.
Me.

Closed every Sunday.
Closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold from home.
It's cold, I'm fat.
It's kind of cold.
Why don't you get yourself a sweater?
He knew that the bear loved the honey.
It doesn't matter if Tom did it or not.
That's perfectly normal.
All right, now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep.
That's very nice!
It's ready!
It’s not easier to start than to stop.
It's easy to be brave from a distance.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
It looked like the bus was late.
That sounds completely ridiculous.
It seems like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Looks like nothing's changed.
It looks very strange.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Tom doesn't seem to be in a hurry.
It's like you don't want this coming together for me.
I think you're being honest.
I think you're wrong.
Looks like we're going to have an extraordinary guest.
It's Chinese to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Oh, dear.
It's fair if they get the same pay for the same job.
It's not nearly perfect.
It's far from ideal.
That's yours.
You know, it's funny.
He's starting to get drunk.
He's getting serious.
We're going to be tough.
It won't be easy.
It's lucky to see a wave star.
It's good to be warm.
It's good to learn.
It's great that he was able to come.
I'm sure you'll laugh.
It's hard not to come to that conclusion.
It’s hard to believe that the weather has been clear and sunny so far.
Hard to describe.
It’s hard to find a place to sleep in this city.
It's hard to put into words.
Hard to say in words.
It's hard to steal a thief.
It's weirdly beautiful.
His head is disproportionate.
High.
The kids are already in bed.
Stop with the money-laundering.
It's warmer than usual tonight.
It's illegal.
That's important.
It is important for parents to stand on one side when the row is raised.
It is important that we help those who are in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You have to swim in here.
You can't breathe in here.
Inability to meet your expectations.
It is impossible to meet your requirements.
I don't know what tomorrow brings.
Unbelievable, you know?
It's inevitable.
It's inspiring.
It's just a feeling.
It's just over there.
It's just a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
I just don't want to die today.
It's pretty hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take it home.
It's nice of you to say that.
It's late.
It's been washed today.
It's like a seabed field, and the turtles, the seagulls, and the sharks above it, like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
It's me.
It's pathetic the way you live.
It's too cold to swim.
This is my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
It's my turn now.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
It's not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
He's not as careful as he sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
This won't happen.
It's not your job to change Egypt.
That's not mine.
It's not my fault.
Not negotiable.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This is not the 19th century.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It’s not about what you do, it’s about how you do it.
It's not worth it to yell at him.
I didn't talk to you.
I didn't tell you.
I didn't tell you.
There's no point in confessing to the priest if you don't confess your sins.
There's no point in twisting the past.
It's snowing.
It's obviously broken.
It's clearly impossible.
It's obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It's not a bad thing to think of some as farmers.
It's okay if you're hot.
“It’s been three months, and Tomi says he’s fluent in French.” “Well, he’s at the top of the dumbass.” “What’s the top?” — Dunning-Kruger effect.
Just three days.
It's on the other side of the park.
That sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's as if I'm throwing it out of the ditch.
He stretched out his wings.
That's amazing.
He's pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of these misanthropic theories is evident in the estimation of the working class, liberating imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars it has waged, and in denying the very essence of the idea of the infinite human war.
It's very urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are very few large gardens in Japan.
Is it true?
That's a really big number.
It's over there.
It's hard to ask someone how much they're looking for.
They say the Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they'll be leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston now.
It's so good to stay home.
He's still moving.
It's suicide.
This is technically possible.
This is the best book I have read so far.

You don't have to do that anymore.
It doesn't take much time.
It worked beautifully.
It works perfectly with the iPhone.
That would be dangerous.
That would be different.
It's hard for me to get out of here.
It would be pointless.
It would have been better if it had already been arranged.
