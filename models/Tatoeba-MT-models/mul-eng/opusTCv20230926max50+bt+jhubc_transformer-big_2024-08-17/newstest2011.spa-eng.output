What is counted? The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague does not know either Voldemort or the pastry shop
The new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD councillors in the capital will have to overcome, it seems, the obvious language barriers for the members of the Prague City Council and the municipal council to understand their renewed SDG colleagues.
The Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz period “examined” members of the new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Council to check their knowledge of the slang-marked language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary that used the flower and political nata of Prague during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been proven that the new councillors hardly understand those familiar concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is, I don't know."
“I’m rather a novice in Prague politics,” said Culture Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> during the “college” terminology exam.
And as for the veteran politician, Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted equally.
Maybe they know the concept of "golf hole".
"Perhaps it's the only expression of all of those you've asked me what I use from time to time."
"If not, usually in slang employment."
From the glossary, whose definitions published the newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz last June before the SDG voting congress, the editorial board chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the Prague municipal authorities.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "Prague's biggest golf hole", "go to the pastry shop", "tower's neck", "treason of the capital" and "blind".
Three councillors agreed to the test and a fourth, Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, who in the future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, directly refused to do so.
"I don't get into these things and I don't think I'm going to appreciate how the civic democrats are enjoying themselves."
“What really matters to me is how we will understand how to run our programs,” he said.
As has been seen, Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly would not have realized that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The word "Voldemort" says nothing to Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>; the only term he came up with in the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
“It’s the Blanka tunnel,” says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, who immediately adds: “But I know better from the news.”
“I’m going to have to take a language course,” he joked.
Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina is not the only one to recognize the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the Environmental Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
Afterwards, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort really is and Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even knows where to find that character; moreover, he suspects the meaning of "going to the bakery".
"I think it means going to a Prague company"; soon Plach<0xC3><0xBD> reveals that it is the headquarters of the Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek companies.
Like B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, it indicates that such knowledge got them from the news, but that it does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, among the socio-democracy there is no glossary so familiar of colloquial terms.
“I asked my colleagues, but it really looks like we don’t have anything like it.”
“Better, we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations, or word games with names,” says Prague-based <0xC4><0x8C>SSD president Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>, whose partymates call Hulda.
“In school I was called B<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>za, but I don’t know if my classmates call me that too,” admits his own nickname Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
The newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz tested the name and it works.
For his party mates, Weinert is D<0xC4><0x9B>da (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they partnered before the fraudulent elections during the party's sponsorship, is nicknamed "Igr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek" ("playmobil") by some of his peers.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that the Social Democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz even discovered other nicknames for this Prague president.
“The doctor of the rights of the bitches” seems to remember that Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava police academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of “witches,” as it published in a pamphlet
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually of advanced age, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who become witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men rarely suffer such a bell."
“It is also not isolated to healthy young women, because they help in the work and have children,” explains a nun who, in the state capital of West Africa Burkina Faso, occupies a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information booklet that should help prevent witch hunts.
However, this has a stick.
“More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso don’t know how to read,” warns the journal Die Standard about the disadvantages of written sensitization.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighboring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate accumulation of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was trapped in the oil used for ritual anointings.
He was caught in flames when the group wanted to “throw out the bad spirits” of the woman.
The isolation of the “witches” is supported by people of all educational levels.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted a 42-year-old Burkina Faso businessman as saying: “Human soul eaters have always been a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to pacify the witch hunt, in the Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
Gambian President Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt that allegedly had been related to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself by means of black magic.
“To help him he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president’s personal escort, were forcibly taken randomly chosen men and women from among the Gambian peoples to the president’s property in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
In the farm, the arrested people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that also caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay on the estate.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand detainees.
Bakala’s tenant: heats up with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The man, of advanced age and shyness, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "carbon magnate" Zde<0xC5><0x88>ek Bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried some documents with the new three-story leases: his, his daughter's and his son's, who is serving a sentence.
All three of them have just been caught up in the liberalization of rents.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns per month, the child will pay 4,100 crowns from next year for a two-bedroom apartment with a second-class separate kitchen.
“Furthermore, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler,” shows the man with his finger in his son’s new contract, over which he has full powers.
“But I signed it,” he explains, half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants do not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, the date on which they will publish a guide informing about how to proceed in these cases.
But in the face of this, man only makes a pledge.
“Everyone says one thing,” he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a great laboratory for testing liberalization.
After New Year will happen with the vast majority of the flats that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
Therefore, Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of the four in Ostrava and, Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to it a machine to pick up number.
"Rentaler 2011", can be read in a bright button of your touch screen.
When you press it, a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
Almost no time to read "157" and the number already appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the queue.
Soon after, an advanced marriage arrives to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: settlement requests, insurance issues, and similar issues.
The letters with the new leases will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the tenants of the majority of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty offers a 15 to 38% increase in rent on the cards.
On November 18, a special window opens in the customer service center for new rentals.
“It’s been running for a week, so it’s starting,” the workers who are in it when the client presents themselves as a journalist, after briefly doubting it, respond.
The liberalization and the old mining floors of Bakala are the most delicate topics in the area.
Before the elections, they were already dealt with high and clear by the Deputy President of Parliament, Ostrava-born Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, and now appear continuously in the newspapers in the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
“I didn’t even change the damn bathroom plate,” the man mentioned in the introduction said.
According to the workers, for the moment they are more than retired to check if they receive a rental discount if they sign on time, as promised by the special RPG offer.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15 will also receive half of the February rental discount.
However, the window of the mining “liberalization” certainly does not manage to dispel the avalanche of doubt.
“Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only asked about the rent in 2011 about forty or fifty people,” the window employee estimates.
In the meantime, RPG proposes on the web and in its tables to hold individual meetings about contracts when necessary.
If the two parties fail to reach an agreement on the lease, an independent judge will have to resolve the matter.
“It’s not a threat, it’s information about the only possible way to proceed and completely in accordance with the law,” RPG warns in its pages.
“No one is going to be judged here,” says one of Byty’s RPG employees and a man standing on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
“I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means of going to court,” he says.
But, immediately, the employee raises the doubt.
"We'll see."
“Mr. Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait,” he said.
Rental regulation will cease to exist in the majority of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
“Current rentals still do not even cover the amounts needed to maintain the community fund,” recalls Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, who adds that the careless state of the community fund that angers tenants is the main rent for the owners.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPGs were able to invest in apartments with rents four billion, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that stand out in red.
“The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties.”
“Furthermore, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per square meter per month,” it is stated on the screen.
Only increased by 38% the rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
“In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19.66 crowns per square meter,” says RPG.
On 2,600 floors, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalization will not impact rents by a blow, but will escalate between four and eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent increase (see the chart) again on the floors, mainly in savings in heating: new windows and heating.
People who sign the lease agreement will have priority.
Architects have understood that offices also need daycare.
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that they also hide inside a small nursery with everything their own to such facilities: color walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can come to her.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, whose study went out of numerous well-known buildings in Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-guardry.
The company employs about 90 people, mainly at the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, the nursery is one of the benefits offered by Arch.Design to its workers as part of its social program.
The builders and architects in this way have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of children.
The mini-guardry was an idea of Arch.Designu’s own employees and, with the support of the management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s mini-guardry is funded through the European Social Fund within the framework of the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment, as well as the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (a endowment of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) they were able to buy the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When you run out of funding (two years), the company Arch.Design has an obligation to keep the mini-guardry running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the company Economy Rating contributed to the submission of the funding application.
The attention of children is in the hands of qualified staff; in addition, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care. The nursery currently welcomes children without age limit, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since it is a "mini-guardian", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with the shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to adapt to the needs of the parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the contents of the mini-guardian program are comparable to the usual pre-school education program.
In it children not only play, but also receive a quality education: from basic learning to preparation for school, they teach to English.
The class not only has toys and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up late school children when they are away from their workplace.
Parents are more productive while they work.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a loyalty relationship between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is located among the companies sign that they offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened personnel marketing.
The house of bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Observe the interiors of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>
The roof looks like the tail of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs remember the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Because of its shape similar to a skeleton, the locals nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the innovative use of the stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of the scales and the ubiquitous gently curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
The cover of the house plays with dreamy lines, delicate colors and textures drawn from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, one observes a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought order.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, as it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpentia and the torsion of forms continues to surprise us also inside.
The corrugated wood copies the frames of the windows, the railings, the decorations of the doors, the mirrors and the signs.
The Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, located in the Eixample neighborhood at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA1>cia, emerged from the remodeling of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, initially insisted on demolishing the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s idea of making a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, made up of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> alone.
The architect Josep Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in their plans of the project came ornaments for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the facade.
On the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> was the beginning of Jujol’s successful collaboration with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Mil<0xC3><0xA1> and the Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> G<0xC3><0xBC>ell Park, in which other pieces of it are found.
Due to its organic form, the locals soon after its completion named it "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it "the house of the bushes".
It is also said that, at the height of the construction, the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia appears.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motifs.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> projected into the house a unique system for the central heating era with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
It may be strange to see his forty-five-degree inclination.
During construction, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> did not respect at all the building rules of the time and was not influenced by them.
Still, the construction obtained the corresponding permit from the beginning, although obviously in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years after its completion, the town hall was so impacted with the result that it requested to be corrected.
It bothered him, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, rather on the contrary: just fifteen days after the city council’s request, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> applied for (and obtained) permission to rent the two tallest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery of the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The house, of six floors, is completely crossed by a staircase leading up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with the modern concept of connecting space.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the halls and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>, not only got a new fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> plays with the light, white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and tragaluces.
The game with the two colors brings the maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb sunlight.
Anyone can visit the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and recharged apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits, they confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common area and the bush, including the roof terrace.
The price of entry to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entrance of other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly make friends with any resident of the neighboring houses and visit it at home.
How to choose the mattress and somier: women and men look for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really entrusts its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie down, i.e. the mattress and somier.
First of all, they must be complemented perfectly to suit specific users.
During the election, numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and somier is located is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them around more often.
If the channels of the center are not properly ventilated and, above, they are located on a firm base, they keep moisture inside.
When choosing a bed, it also influences the habits.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower and harder surface.
"Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep as well here."
"For his jaw-dropping shoulders, heels and hips needed mattresses with a soft viscoelastic layer."
“These types of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have time problems with the nervous system, so they get bad information from the joints and the skin,” explains Sylva Hadamczikov<0xC3><0xA1>, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italians Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You don’t have to be an NHL player to be able to appreciate the viscoelastics.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to its body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn around as after a hard game.
He just sleeps better.
Viscoelastic also acts as a protection against wounds.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of its feet, i.e., between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example singles, a minimum of 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple rule can be applied to calculate the width: when lying face up, you should have your hands comfortably bent towards the elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>, expert at Cechu <0xC4><0x8D>aloun<0xC3><0xAD>k<0xC5><0xAF> to decorators, who has been dealing with the problem of healthy sleeping and erectile issues for many years.
In the double rooms, everyone needs their own dreamer and mattress, so during the purchase you need to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the sleepers at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with spring interior a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to shapes and softens.
“By touching it with your hand or by settling on the mattress, you certainly shouldn’t notice the springs,” warns Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Each mattress requires a certain type of sommelier.
The fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe poorly and you can’t wash your cover, which is often done today.
And, since we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat each night, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) screen.
For this reason, experts reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime warranty.
However, everything has a but.
That’s why sellers give a tip: in mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of cleaning and washing the case carefully, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers are currently manufactured with zipper closure throughout their perimeter, so when opening them they are left in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their manipulation in the larger models (and for one person) when lifting the mattress can look like a fight between a weight and a weight.
In bed, instead of a dreamer, do you have a firm table?
Never!
As much for beds designed for one night visits.
However, you should make (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes in the table and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulated sheet sommeliers containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g., a combination of latex and coconut fiber) can be used, although it is always better to have a sommelier with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar zone can be adjusted and reinforced.
Articulated sheet lugs should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to reclination.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they perfectly "round" the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is something very important.
They are even remembered by mattress manufacturers who, in the "males", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are sommeliers with cross-structure or tablets with the so-called multitortion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the voltage is reduced.
It should also be borne in mind that even if you use the right mattress and somier, if you use a bad pillow (large and "soft"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should hold the head and the corners can only reach to the shoulders, so that the muscles of them can be relaxed.
The appropriate size recommended is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder cushion or softer area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with original mattresses filled with straw.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, organic mattresses are fashionable.
Oil-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, for example castor or soy.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soy.
“Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin,” explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh scent to forest or lavender.
There are also differences between men and women.
While men "refresh" with plant extracts of breeze, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women prefer to "warm" the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel more warmth.
The favorites right now?
Cold foam mattresses, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold foam and viscoelastic rigidities makes it possible to manufacture mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as health care.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and sommeliers.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a Memory memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 crowns.
The second one is available for free.
The era of viscoelastics with an open cell structure and high density began with the "cosmic" material of Tempur.
It initially emerged as material for NASA, because during the takeoffs astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, although also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents use people tracking devices to control their children
The fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also track people’s movement and thus contribute, for example, in the case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
At the moment the device is about the size of a box of candles, but will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were afraid of the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
“We’re all trying to tell ourselves that it’s not about spying, but another way to lessen the chances of a tragedy,” said Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
“I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they are put in someone’s pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases.”
“Most customers actually buy it for security reasons,” adds Pilin.
In their opinion, children should always know what "cajita" is for and how it is used in case of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> warns about the fact that if the child does not want to carry it, he will simply throw it away.
“Even younger children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they want to prevent them from controlling them.”
“In the past, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device,” Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> says.
In your opinion, it is questionable whether in case of attack such a device is really useful.
“If it’s a ready-made kidnapping, the author will almost always check if the child carries some kind of electronic device that can reveal his location.”
"Now it's the phone."
“As the use of tracking devices expands, it will also look for them, as their sale will undoubtedly be carried out with a lot of publicity.”
“In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack of a pedophile.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can be helpful.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a certain period."
"If you suffer damage, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person in question."
“The most expensive devices carry an integrated tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and remains stationary, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In your opinion, such a service can be obtained even with mobile phones with navigation, in which only special software must be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices that are similar in size to a screen box or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, for this reason tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential attacker may not identify the device."
“Or identifying it after a certain time, which can make the police gain time,” he adds.
Although tracking devices are carried on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology that is used for tracking vehicles.
It is the verification of the position with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone communicating the current position.
The army has enough wicks to encircle the whole of the Czech Republic, but they only last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of mecha to catch explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of mecha to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the wick is two years, four at most.
The army bought the explosives wick from the STV Group, a.s. for forty million crowns.
The General’s staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of wick saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometers of wick per year.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnicians, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is nevertheless decided that, in such a case, such maneuvers should be carried out with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, high command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want exemptions from either Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr and Army Captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way could it be justified that the army spent sixty kilometers of mecha.
That's the equivalent of 25,000 explosions.
Even if it were, the army would have enough stockpiles for more than ten years.
On the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two meters of mecha, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of engineering or special units) sufficient stock for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally recently to Minister Vondra because they say they barely have ammunition for various weapons, so even shooting practices for money are limited.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also don't understand that we repeatedly buy such amounts of mecha."
“But it’s their decision and they’ll certainly know why they’re acting that way.”
“For us, the military is a good customer that, as a company, we try to satisfy,” admits STV Group Commercial Director Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek defended the hundreds of miles of mecha, saying he would also have stockpiles of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, of STV Group, indicates that the mecha only has a lifespan of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, of two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its service life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, when buying 445 kilometers of mecha, it got a discount.
“They cost us 60% less than last year’s order of 244 kilometers,” said spokesman Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the Ministry of Defense’s shopping center.
Just to compare: the annual mecha consumption of police pyrotechnics, which eliminate World War II ammunition or that left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters in years.
In addition, the police always only ask for the fair amount to exhaust the ammunition before its useful life is over.
They decided it for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and, in addition, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of wick can be achieved.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in ending tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: it will have to remove hundreds of kilometers of old wick, which is now being bought "cheap".
So far I still live from the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest helped Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun sell his hotel franchises.
The last edition, won the contest "Entrepreneur of the Year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun de Liberec.
His success story seems to come from a movie.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad, he realized that in Liberec there was a lack of quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he met with seasonal work abroad and a bank loan he bought a house that was half-empty composed of five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year at university, he was really brave.
"Currently, the quality-price ratio of accommodation in our area pushed me to do something about it," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
He began renting the first rebuilt floor to foreign workers.
All of the income he earned was reinvested in the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room guest house.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he gradually opened in Liberec four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,” the number one entrepreneur said last year.
"This sale of hotel opening licenses greatly helped win the 'Entrepreneur of the Year' contest," added Pytloun.
The victory increased its fame and popularity in both Liberec and the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice,” he recalls.
Without a doubt, recommend everyone who wants to try any company that participates in the contest.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he is still living from the contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
“With some people I’ve met thanks to the contest I’ve started to collaborate regularly.”
The reputation associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
in total about seventy.
“I’ve seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to be involved in something that earned the overall recognition.”
"It's not, much less, my own personal success, but it's the result of the hard work of the whole team."
“It’s just my name that appears in the foreground,” says modestly Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we have had at Farmet
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already gone through the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone "Company of the Year" contest, last year at the "Slavic House" in Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to convert a small technical workshop in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Skalice into a firm with a business volume of hundreds of millions.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition,” the winner said last year.
The story of Farmet begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>’s father the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the property embargo during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he gave up his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic piles.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the media contest.
“Not only did our customers start to consider the Farmet brand to be considerably better, but foreign partners also started to value collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year maybe it wasn’t at Farmet just a sample of the euphoria of victory.
It also gained recognition for commercial results until 2008 and, in part, from 2009.
And 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and start limiting the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"Obviously we didn't get rid of that situation either."
“Incomes were reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some layoffs,” explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must, at times, take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company’s profits, albeit at lower levels than before the crisis.
In spite of everything, where Farmet did not cut expenses was in research and development.
“With the grants we have built a research and training center, strengthened our presence in the international market and obtained great valuations at national fairs,” says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
All this indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are rising again and, with them, the number of new employees.
“The new achievement is expected to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A survey that reveals the ridiculous rules
The absurdity survey of the year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the absurdity survey of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than a third of the nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested an extract from the trade register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
“The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer request an extract from the trade register when it carries out a check on the insured’s taxes,” said Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the Czech Social Security Agency.
The aim of the Absurdity of the Year survey is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must respect and try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year it is part of the business tournament of the publication Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny for the fourth time and begins to create a hobby among the general public as well.
While last year’s edition had the participation of three thousand voters, this year it almost reached four thousand.
And it’s not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations that must be respected simply for trading.
“Perhaps in the number of papers needed for tax return we are first in the world,” says Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business rules has been a declared goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation is improving especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, the Czech Republic is ranked 74th, i.e. eight places worse than last year.
The absurdity contest of the year was held for the first time in 2006 and every year is repeated in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and, during October, allows the public to vote online through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than one hundred rules and regulations were introduced for this year’s survey, including 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
The examples were sent by both entrepreneurs and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay for the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of this year’s seventy proposals is published on the contest pages.
The announcement of the contest, which is always held at the beginning of November in Prague’s Wenceslas Square, is part of an event in which people from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, director of the Association of small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic, attended this event.
“Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the state continuously puts obstacles to entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade,” said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations do not remain in bottled water.
In 2007, what bothered people the most was the employer’s obligation to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operation area, the intention to go with a position at a trade fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation, which ended in second place in the number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third one is the winner.
The absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physical therapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had removed the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny contest is the category called Responsible Company of the year 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
“In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the company Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s edition of the main contest of Vodafone Enterprise 2010 companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between each other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is for example people with disabilities, in other personal or employee health problems.
Among the fourteen finalists of the whole Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main donor of funds to sponsor disabled children for seven years.
In Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad, there is a stationery that cares especially about the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70% of the workforce; that is why it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the contest Vodafone Company of the year ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc he won the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it purchases primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities produce the least possible impact on the environment,” explains entrepreneur Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The responsible IT company Enlogit of the region of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Persona en pouros scholarship, which helps the local Roma community in particular," says the representative of the company Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
The company Pran<0xC3><0xAD> a <0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC3><0xAD> from the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that affect their pension funds, is also well placed with a mention.
“We benefit from food, transportation, skills improvement and leisure,” says Josef Strap<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>, from Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l Czasch’s construction company, a winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the category of Responsible Company of the year it was automatically assigned to all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the year contest who answered the questions of the registration form and sent it before August 15th to the organizers.
The organizers removed forms that were not complete or incorrect from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Company contest responsible for the year, but they are not disqualified from the "principal" contest Vodafone Company of the year."
“Individual applications for this competition are not allowed, as this is a subcategory of the main Business of the Year competition,” explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose consultancy.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
Police against corruption have carried out several arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives married a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G.
It seems that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned land would be received by an accurate stakeholder.
He had to pay Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. half a million crowns for it.
“For the moment, I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribes during a public auction and public tender,” Pilsen Attorney General Antonie Zelen<0xC3><0xA1> told Pravo, adding that at the moment she cannot disclose further details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
On the way he could influence the public auction, given the little official information, one can only speculate.
Agricultural Fund spokesman Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>ra <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1> responded to Pravo’s questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen’s headquarters and went during a public auction.
“This is a customer, not one of our employees,” he said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, the public auction is called "Call for the submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with the law on land" and is held when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
“These people, during the call, offer a value higher than their return, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced.”
“Based on the offers, the order of the buyers is determined, and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person who offers the highest bid,” the Fund’s spokesperson explained.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had information about who was going to present himself at the call and, since he is at the same time an interested person because he acquired various restitution rights, proposed to those interested in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on him.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had special contacts at the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former head of the PF V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. has just obtained from the Fund some planned land for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular at the place where a large road to the industrial area of Borsk<0xC3><0xA1> pole should be built.
Then, he exchanged them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city itself with a much higher value.
In this case, the city council had to intervene because otherwise the blocked land would avoid construction.
Families will have to pay an additional cost of several hundred crowns per month.
From January onwards, households will have to pay not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating accessories and, in some cases, larger rentals.
As a result, families will have to take several hundred crowns a month out of the portfolio, starting in January, more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, gas around 2%, in some cities will have to pay up to 10% more for water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 more crowns per year than now.
However, major electricity suppliers have cut prices, due to the fact that it has increased support for the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaics.
However, the gas is moderately heavier, especially at the time when heating is most used and therefore higher is consumption.
In this case, they should also have a couple of hundred crowns more per year.
While electricity and gas are surging across the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The price increase is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, homes in Pardubice or Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové will pay from January for central heating about 50 more crowns per month, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns per year.
Residents in Prague will also have to endure a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rent of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, Praguens will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will increase by 7.4%.
They can significantly increase the rental prices of 450,000 flats rented in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 floors in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, will increase rent from January to 100%.
The company will take the courts to those who do not agree with the new lease.
Regulated rentals, which benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase by up to 10% next year.
The young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer so, because it has a slow effect
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good stolen whiskeys to his parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers under the age of fifteen to end up in medical care.
Children who end up in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
“Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to get drunk.”
“Fashion is now strong alcoholic beverages,” says the head of pediatrics at Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in central Bohemia, Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
“When they manage to get a bottle to their father from the hustle and bustle, it can be whisky, but it’s usually Fernet and vodka.”
“Vodka has the advantage of being lightened with juice and not smelling as much,” he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokesperson of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or Ron."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
“In some cases, they use aguardian they took at home,” Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> adds.
According to Chief Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, they are 13- and 14-year-old drinkers who usually appear in hospitals.
Prior to Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter maybe four times."
“It started at the age of twelve, when they brought it with 3.5 alcohol in the blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy,” says the department’s doctor on the case.
"He was at the Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice fair at some dance party."
“The interesting thing is that his mother was not surprised that his daughter was missing for 48 hours,” he said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance for drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, dependence cannot be properly discussed.
“It is understood by an alcoholic to a person who has had a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children.”
“In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it’s rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment,” explains chief Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
According to the spokesman Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>, this year, 40 drunk children were hospitalized at the Motol pediatric clinic until mid-November.
However, the statistics only show those who come with severe poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after medical recognition, go home with their parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases in which children simply meet after school and drink a hot drink, for Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n there are three seasonal highs to mention: Witch’s Day, End of the Year and end of the school year.
“In such circumstances, they drink for bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holiday.”
“On Witch’s Day I’ve come to see up to seven drunk children in admissions at once,” Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n adds.
Drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injecting a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that the body lacks.
"These carry it much better, because after a rough night, they get up well and don't hurt anything."
“They only show confusion about where they are,” Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n points out, adding that patients often lose their good mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
Ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for serious patients cost tens of thousands of crowns.
“I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the children directly how much their drinking has cost and that they would have to spend all summer in a job for young people to earn enough to pay for themselves that night,” Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n adds.
Health insurance, in your opinion, perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually returns people the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, left on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
It is the first time such a device is in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad to carry out practice or demonstration flights.
This is the L-159T1 twin-seat version, which until now used the Czech army and was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 monoplanes.
These are still kept in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, the company Omnipol, already took care of them last week.
Jan Peje<0xC5><0xA1>k, from the defense press department, says it is not yet known when Vodochody’s planes will be physically retired.
“The L-159 single-seat aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the long-repaired aircraft, with no additional investments or contributions from the Ministry.”
"The L-159T1 twin-seats were exchanged in their current state," he told Pravo Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
He added that the army does not run out of two-seater aircraft, as in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for a sum of 200 million crowns for the construction of four L-159 devices unnecessary for two-seaters.
One of the new aircraft has already been received by the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS committed to adding aircraft to the equipment of some Allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that the EADS company is the one that pulls out L-159s and that they will serve for the practice of pilots from NATO countries."
“It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how he will use them in this framework,” Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek says.
The newspaper Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159s.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek’s government.
The Ministry of Defense did not convene a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defence direction states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army acquired 72 aircraft from Aer and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by conducting a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa aircraft and the latter should arrive at Kbely Prague airport in fourteen days.
A finger index longer than the annular indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the annular are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British magazine about cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
“Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, according to Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index finger of the right hand shorter than the annular.
They were as likely to have prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the annular finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he knows the study, but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer can be "completely demonstrated".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, opened a snow cover on Thursday.
The roads and sidewalks are covered mainly by compact snow and the Quitaniev machines circulated throughout the night in numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between 89 and 93 kilometres in the direction of Rozvadov due to several industrial vehicle accidents and tourism, as was the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Central Automotive Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
In kilometre 91 a truck was found, in 93 two industrial vehicles collided, causing injuries.
Several tourists also ended up in the cunet.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometre 185 towards Prague.
There, two trucks collided.
Drivers must move slowly after Brno at kilometre 190 or cross Brno and get incorporated at kilometre 182 in K<0xC3><0xBD>valce.
There have been several kilometers of traffic jams.
There was also an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and thermometers indicate -7 oC.
Obstacles are forming, for example, in Prosek, although it is also congested <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> and N<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC3><0xAD>ru.
At eight o’clock in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and the airport.
Due to the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travelers should check what the current situation is.
Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> Airport was closed from 11 a.m. on Wednesday until 5 a.m.
Currently, it can already be circulated by most of the roads of southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brnoska snow languages are being formed and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rous<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Milling machines will be required to clean them.
At the moment it is not possible to say when they will open up to circulation.
In Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nska, caution is required in the area of the B<0xC3><0xAD>lé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region that, since it is a protected natural area, should simply be left inert, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
In the Czech Republic they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfalls are gradually referred to in the Czech Republic.
U.S. Soldiers Have a New ‘Smart Gun’
The U.S. military is using a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, known at the moment only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals expect the new rifle to influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that "change the progress of the game" made their victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol and with an extremely precise punctuation.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosive load it contains causes it to actually work like a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies who hide behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Without a doubt, you can’t use normal protection and, when you throw your killer rain of metal chips, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use “smart” technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point at it their laser beam, determine the distance, then get a precise point of view and, depending on it, correct the projection line and tighten the trigger."
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters."
“When the trigger is pressed, the gun loads and launches the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, minus one, two or three meters,” Audette said.
400 jobs are being relocated
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As announced by the computer-savvy sector giant and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e Street in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesman explained that in the medium term another 100 employees from the consortium, which were previously spread across the region, will be staying there.
The offer is highly attractive, in addition to the collective office at Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The bright connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region sparked joy yesterday among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt’s head of economics, Markus Frank (CDU) said that with that a “Global Player” has been won.
This is a “magnificent recognition of the location.”
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger’s mayor, Michael Korwisi (Greens) regrets Fujitsu’s decision.
The management previously informed the city of its intention.
"Of course we have offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, the economic reasons produced the fall.
Thus, there is now a large empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope that the owner and the landlord of the building will show cooperatives."
The property previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of the remaining Marienbader Platz buildings for ten years of a controversial project to build the seaside town.
As a joint project of the city and a private enterprise of projects between the station and the city council, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism of the massive building that used the gaps as parking spaces and in terms of the level of the buildings.
In 2001 investment consultancy and rating companies were installed, the software manufacturer for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the home computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later sold to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, originating in Tokyo, is recognized as the world’s third-largest IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides accurate services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That’s why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the 1920s, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses, among others, the central association of electrical engineering and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
The anxiety is taking over Wikileaks more and more.
The Amazon Internet service provider has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
There may be political pressure behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, appears to be detained in England.
WikiLeaks’ platform of revelations is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently seeking an internet homeland in Europe.
The well-known U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman calls other countries and businesses to boycott WikiLeaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, must remain in detention in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks removed from Amazon server."
“Talking freely in the country of freedom,” the activists of the revelations reported via the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Just before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon services website to be able to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter, WikiLeaks explained the following: “Perfect, we will allocate our dollars to hire people in Europe.”
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Sen. Joe Lieberman had requested investigation, CNN reported on a call to Lieberman’s office.
The presidency of the Senate’s Security Council had threatened Amazon with boycott, the British “Guardian” reported.
"I had wished that Amazon would take these measures earlier, before the previous publications of information classified through Wikileaks," he said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and reckless process puts our national security at risk and threatens life in the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks with its service to extend stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to an article in the London-based newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The internet activist has consistently described the investigation in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats in London.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That’s why he fears for Assange’s safety, Hrafnsson said.
Thus, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson reacted clearly to North America’s statements.
In America, former Arkansas Republican governor Mike Huckabee said the person responsible for WikiLeaks revelations must be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, government chief Stephen Harper’s advisor, clearly ironically, said on television that Assange should “be killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
There is a growing dispute between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had asked for the resignation of the secretary of state, should she be responsible for recently ordering diplomats involved in espionage tasks.
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than your website.”
The U.S. government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution at the National Center for Counter-Terrorism, was appointed as an exceptional officer, the White House announced.
Travers is therefore responsible for developing "important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of Wikileaks leaking.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that to take care of the security of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardise the publication of Wikileaks.
“We’ve done everything we can to get in touch with them,” State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream parlors are prepared in the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream parlors has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream come from?
From the gelato and the gelato.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The ice cream removes the ice cream from the counter with a spatula, spreads it over the barge and sells it.
To know this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the “Gelato University” of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the university of ice cream with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream parlors has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special extra-day courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk their vague desires in the soft ice cream.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of this art in California, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own in a few years within an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
The ice cream teacher Luciano Ferrari then explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is decisive not only its good taste, but also its silky softness and its good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation nor the nata cover of the national upper house and mainly from the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and therefore every ball has something romantic."
The first step in the process seems very easy.
Luciano throws the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and currently cools it down to four degrees.
Then it opens the tap of the machine and comes out a pasteurized white basic cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without a stylizer?
How can you let go of some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises that they dismiss the trends of the time.
He who speaks of ice cream "not only natural ingredients", has best used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, of guar bean.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a sound of granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of the ice cream, the Luciano master distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the desserts of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
"All suppliers will try to paste flavored ingredients into their merchandise."
“But you should try it sometime.”
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the ice cream of the white base mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible chocolate pleasures.
Now participants of the course can use the refrigerators.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, moca and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
They do the same experiment also with types of fruit ice cream.
Knowing better does not necessarily depend on having more toffee or more pure fruit flavor.
It is not necessary that the ice cream of hazelnuts be known to dry fruits, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group elaborates the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the taste of ice cream, says Luciano.
Ice making is a problem of arithmetic: Melocoton puree with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar must be reduced from the basic recipe.
For lemon ice cream, an extra serving of sugar is needed.
Luciano takes out a tool with which he sets the amount of sugar of the types of fruits (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the account easier.
Making ice cream does not require more than the physical application, as before.
Not only does it help the tool for the automatic processing of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is beaten simultaneously and cooled to a low temperature.
After all, all automation is left out in terms of the small folder.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit purée, as if he were a mini-first giant without control.
“In all courses,” says the Luciano, “it’s just a matter of time before something like this happens.”
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has infiltrated the industry experimenting with transgenic plants.
Currently this issue is formulated by the group of experts Testbiotech, which is considered an institute for independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
“It seems like a conspiracy theory but we haven’t documented it well,” Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of Efsa’s group of experts on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been employed for years in the Ilsi association.
Consortiums like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to Efsa’s testing standards for genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest.
Efsa's provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of Ilsi's situation and mimic the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa went without the support or the transition time to the Swiss Agrirkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that his team.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were conducted by the General Environmental Office as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data is used, including some in the industry, provided they are of high quality and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working at Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the U.S.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In this topic, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that currently transgenic plants are allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not checked.
“We want to know what, for example, makes genetically modified corn in agriculture,” says Then.
The current practice is to check only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
"If the risks are not sought, how are they going to be found?", asked the accuser, then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, the industry is increasingly trying, in the US and in Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not generally published.
“The industry controls security research,” Hilbeck says.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday he was in front of Stuttgart station, with the Tube behind him.
There were demonstrations
Don't bother.
The story is well known: In September the excavators arrived and began to take down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: Thousands and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions in the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing became debris.
Wheel in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfieldern, 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They shouldn't disappear."
He is excited: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he has olivated the smoke from cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what to do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
The trace of Stuttgart's stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former French Navy ammunition depot, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He has bought everything that results from the demolition in Stuttgart.
“There would be disgrace, they would tear up the gravel or they would send it to the trash,” he says in his office, a wooden house that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, who had bought the remains of the northern wing from the company of demolitions.
He spoke to the enemies of the 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the downfall.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilogram massif cut, with a price per piece from 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a memory but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has long since been sold.
Owner of gardens, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could carry in the suitcase and above.
Stuttgart's stone of momentum has long since become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kr<0xC3><0xA4>uterbeeten.
“Actually, this stone is nothing special,” says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
Ascension to his all-terrain, he does a tour of his great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's a stone lover.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
He transports his treasures all over Germany.
It is said to be the country’s largest ancient stone merchant.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic sandstones chopped.
"They belonged to the Dresden Marienbr<0xC3><0xBC>cke bridge," he explains.
White, yellow, warm, get excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Mark a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And it goes on.
"Beautiful travertine."
In the past, the massifs belonged to the court of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from Sankt Blasien church, tobacco from Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he first sculpted the stones and moved them with a simple apparatus and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
He has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave to the stone-handler, in addition to quarries, a sculptor, a potter, a glassmaker and a gardener have installed themselves up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the man in charge of taking advantage of the remains.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are also rocks to rescue.
The fight for talent around great potentials
There is an active affluence in the buffet.
16 students huddle around the pancakes, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of contest of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Competing and similarly, many companies, such as VW, gather in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: Hire students with the most talent from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the job market and are hired by others.
And as universities do not facilitate publications about their students’ skills, they try to sharpen exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins the talents.
A lady in the staff department shares pens, elbows and folders with the VW logo.
Explain to the enthusiastic young talents the internship programs and work for students and show them their ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig leads the project with VW.
See advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
“In turn, VW can get to know students, look more closely at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers.”
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are so directly desired.
“The main point previously was in the technical projects,” says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not they have to be announced and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), in October there were 40,000 vacancies for engineers.
And, according to the VDI forecasts, this vacuum of engineers will grow even more.
In the auditing and consulting company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of talent hunting.
It organizes expensive hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern Yincan, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the exit.
Only the cream of many participants goes to the U.S.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the crowd."
"The simple journey alone was short."
For talented hunters Dykta the notes give results.
“To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants.”
“Some are nearing their end, and they want to ask to work with us,” he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also hunting, above all, small and medium-sized companies, classics with their work fairs.
"We tried to get students at the specialized fairs."
“Something about Intersolar,” says Sitha St<0xC3><0xBC>be, staff manager for solar technology maker Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
St<0xC3><0xBC>be knows the problem of the new generation.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company’s website.
"It's getting very difficult to fill vacancies."
“It takes a lot of time and money,” he says.
A shorter path is the contact with the professors of the university.
Solarworld collaborates with several high schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
“Teachers advise that you can practice with us or do your theses.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That’s why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
“A large consortium can’t normally offer it,” says St<0xC3><0xBC>be, the staff manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
Decisive factors are flexible working hours, childcare, or good climbing opportunities.
According to a study by Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld holds 55th place among Germany’s top 100 employers.
The institute prepares an annual list of the best German employment providers.
For what he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and the environment in it and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
St<0xC3><0xBC>be, the staff manager also expects extra points in her ranking for her aspiring to work.
“I think the applicant is particularly fixated on the external rankings of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy that gains a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers to be more authentic.
And that, according to Kriegler, means, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves,” he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called Employer Branding internal, also promoting corporate identity within the template itself.
"A satisfied employee is the best ambassador."
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer by friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a gang game,” Kriegler says.
Obama halts new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and with it cancelled its previous plans unappealingly.
Also off the Atlantic coast remain new perforations sealed for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will at least be in place for the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform in April.
Before the misfortune that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the largest environmental catastrophe in the U.S., President Barack Obama had admitted new drillings in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters wanted to reduce the U.S. dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, different oil consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by employing tougher controls and tighter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible supervisory authority, which after being accused of corruption charges has fallen into disrepute, is reformed from the ground up.
Obama announces in parallel that the lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the Gulf will be reduced thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey conducted by the BDO advisory firm - before Wednesday's extraction ban.
American Energy Alliance complains of insecurity in the sector: “Nobody knows what exactly changes with regulation.”
Investments in new extraction projects will soon be extended, to the detriment of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil marble, it smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of poured oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogonilandia.
People live from theft, corruption and the illegal trade in oil.
Celestine Akpobari looks good.
“Don’t get tired,” the environmental activist reassures reporters: “Today enough oil will pass before your eyes.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wandering in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It is not seen that brown oil stains float on the surface.
He used to take a handful of shrimp here, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the liquid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to reach fish-filled waters: that, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered to be one of the most austere regions in the world.
Along the path of the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat's engine removes a brown broth, which dips its hand in the water, will pull out some oil-filled ones.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark regalia sticks, sadly isolate the palm trees that collide and hang their palms.
In vain they are looking for flocks of birds, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier from the outside is quiet, a kind of ghostly calmness of an earlier paradise with a smell of gasoline.
“What happens here is an ecological struggle,” says hurricane Celestine Akpobari. “We live in constant danger to health.”
The war comparison is going on.
The area of the settlement of the Ogoni has been a busy battleground for years: here the first European explorers broke up more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 80s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for them.
Even today, companies are still prohibited from returning to Ogonilandia: While pumping more than two million barrels of black gold from the entire delta region daily, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were inexhaustible.
Every two hundred meters, steel platforms protruded like extravagance water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drillers.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
At every moment a head fails, Akpobari believes, then sends a constant jet of oil into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the wreck of the Exxon Valdez 21 years ago in the sea of Alaska, one of the largest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the long-term environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell’s consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see heads about to break and leak pipes as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the world conventional ones, scientist Richard Steiner blamed the consortium in 2008: Only the defective indices of the pipes are "on a multiple greater than elsewhere".
In a place, which from a distance seems forgotten, a workshop full of oil under the open sky appears, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the perforations, sometimes arbitrarily spread over the ground, a fire blazes: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is heated in the fire for hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes in the container, later the oil pipe drips and eventually diesel comes out.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-litre diesel barrels a day: "Brings us 34,000 naira", around $22.
Residents of the delta take advantage of the fuel shortage in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap diesel price of just 40 euros-cent per litre, illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from “the bunkers,” who called the pipeline network through Ogonilandia: According to experts, at this step at least 16 million litres of oil a day are lost throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a negligible part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly refined illegally: Organized criminal networks, to which also belong politicians and high military positions, keep the best part in aljib and sell it cheaply in the world market.
Akpobari considers the debate purely academic as to whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or to the loose mode of production.
"If the oil tankers did not behave like invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the ogoni are mostly shattered by Shell to the point that only a deduction from the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, like China."
Michael's getting nervous.
“It’s time for you to disappear,” says the muscular <0xC3><0x96>lmann.
"Soldiers can come any minute."
If the special unit of the army takes the illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, if not with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
“This condemned invention has completely broken our country,” says Akpobari.
Researchers Detect Hazardous Factory Defects in A380 Engines
The A380 seems to have a big security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which could produce “a catastrophic failure in the engine.”
Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas Airbus passengers who made an emergency landing in early November were much luckier than can be imagined: Australian air safety authorities perceived, thanks to their investigations, a major safety issue in the engines of some A380s, and warned of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a hose connection, cracks can be caused by fatigue or cracks, ATSB officials announced in a report published Thursday.
This could have caused “a catastrophic engine failure.”
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus, which had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline starts legal proceedings against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in the federal court in Sydney that allowed more legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the engine brand they have lost parts and their wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they will carry out more safety tests on the superjumbs equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesman for ATSB.
The security issue has become important enough to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept about three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa rejected the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-roofed aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
A Nevada across the country causes chaos in traffic
Totally white Germany: From one day to the next it has snowed almost all over the country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter ices Germany: Almost all the country reached freezing temperatures on Thursday night, which has triggered chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a 15 cm thick layer of snow.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and in many streets.
At the A7 up to Flensburg, the snows are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not prepared.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweep the Baltic Sea coast.
Germany’s Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) is expecting live tides with the water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on highways and national roads.
According to the weather service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in S<0xC3><0xA4>chsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of fresh snow there and cold and strong winds are responsible for winding it up.
There, many trucks and cars were trapped during the night.
In Saxony Anhalt, police authorities also reported major disturbances in the streets.
In the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected both A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disruptions are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, trees falling over the tracks or the broken catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony the intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop their trip to Munich.
Firefighters and rescue service served the 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
The snowy winds sweep the streets.
At Germany’s largest airport, snowy winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokesman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokesman, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
The wipers are in continuous operation.
However, there are few stranded passengers at the airport, despite that there are 400 camp beds prepared for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a trucker died in a collision with a train at a road crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg a similar accident occurred due to the snowy streets: Here too a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle was seized.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after taking a ride with her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be softer and dusty and will therefore wind up in soft cracks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutsche Bank settled its headquarters: Twin towers were modernized in the Frankfurt banking district; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to take advantage of the costs of the revival, and seeks a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the Financial Times Deutschland states based on a spokesman.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the sale in the project.
“We always check to see if it’s worth owning or selling the properties and then renting them again,” he said.
That’s why Germany’s largest credit institution relinquishes its company’s headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from the investor of a home fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
The energy reforms reached a figure of approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would make a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field calculate the value of the newspaper's towers renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
If the renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been disclosed at the moment, the spokesman said.
Thousands of mourners for the dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
However, the bodies have not been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago there was an intense explosion at the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced at the site of the disaster, but he did not discover any signs of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue team was able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts deduced that there was no possibility that the miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Today, family and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the shining sunshine in Greymouth on the southern New Zealand island.
They keep quiet for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal objects, under clothing and surfboards.
The flags fluttered at half-staff in front of the country’s government buildings.
New Zealand hoped the miners would return to the surface “from the depths of the earth,” John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, told participants in the commemorative act.
"But they never came home."
He can't assume his son's death until he's seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the relatives of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the abrasive temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
Damn it, warrior!
Does gore fit into artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores the boundaries of the genre with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience will the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when filming "Walhalla Rising"?
A single-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and kills his enemies with near-superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and rip his enemies off their bodies.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it’s actually called, doesn’t say almost any words throughout the movie and the other characters let themselves be carried away by as much as one or two sentences or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise they are quiet and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountainous landscapes of Scotland, which the backdrops offer to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown filmmakers and interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has multiple groups of recipients it is a shame that they cannot be mutually ruled out.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and the trilogy about the drug-trafficking hairstyle "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with some more humor in the mainstream or some less of the house's brutality.
A brain mass and bursting guts can’t deter most fans of artistic cinema.
Most fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and is stuck an eternity in calm and fog before his team arrives in America and shuts down again.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only released on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, after the presumptuous and bloody facade, a piece of film is hidden sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
That is why there is no escape for the spectators.
Refn is barely told a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the grim soundtrack of trance make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a young blonde boy, who faithfully supports Unojo, retains something like innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents loss, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to get angry, upset and surprise.
An experience.
Mysterious Land Movements
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new clues to a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this subject until controls are allowed.
At midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of Euphrates; the largest and closest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley exiting the river.
According to information from the CIA’s U.S. international intelligence service at the end of April 2008, a current reactor was designed under the name of the nearby el-Kibar very suitable for plutonium production, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique hardly serves any other purpose than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the inside.
The reactor was in operation recently, he says, but was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is barely more known than by then, the puzzles became bigger with time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to the attack, the CIA was fully confident that the Syrians had built a reactor in the Kibar, but that it barely saw signs that there was a “nuclear weapons program” in the country.
In Europe, several Secret Service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "plausible".
They lack solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor in front, a senior UN diplomat answered in the summer in a rocky way that the IAEA has “enough material to have questions.”
The Syrians very quickly removed the debris from the alleged "unused military building" and spread the ground to consciousness.
However, in June 2008 an IAEA team under the command of former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, from commercial vendors in the moments immediately following the attack, which must have a greater informative value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not come to market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria always made it clear that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as unlikely after the particle analysis.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss the matter, just as with satellite images.
In addition, controllers are prohibited from a second inspection in el-Kibar and entry to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also has a strict silence.
“We will never comment,” Ehud Olmert, the acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and "progressively turns into a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, is finally pending a serious violation of the non-proliferation treaty, which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clearing, which must be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not made public so far what equipment they are dealing with, what functions they have, or whether they appear suspicious.
According to the newspaper S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah internally, again derived from the vicinity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these sites and located a building complex near Masyaf with satellite imagery, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly located at or immediately next to a military base, Syria for this reason prohibits entry to all three locations to the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians fear a record that the US has asked the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the equipment thanks to warnings from the U.S. Secret Service.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is being moved between the three sites and the cube to the shore of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a high office in Vienna said at least one of the teams could be "related to fuel production."
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities", neither of uranium enrichment nor of reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven with uranium that is not enriched.
Where the uranium should come from and where the plutonium for the bombs should subsequently be separated, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt about whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are in all three places.
As the hundreds of cargoes of the ground trucks disappeared, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The IAEA finds it unlikely that the al-Tibni salt mine, located a few kilometers from el-Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste zone.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked her to the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the photographs from the orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence but it barely helps dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has spent a few months developing an inspection plan there, which the Syrians would allow, to maintain the possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Damascus, however, also criticises this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not been much urgent, for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador, has been scrambling the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear control authorities have.
Yukiya Amano, the IAEA director, who is to propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option I am open to in the future", but is still hesitant.
This path is very risky: the majority of the IAEA’s governing council is needed for this, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly looking forward to an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected: “And what if in the end they find nothing?”
Love in times of war
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie started in the summer with the direction of her yet-unnamed debut.
She herself has written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not much is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
The associations of Bosnian women have protested quickly, with which at the last moment they moved some planned shooting days in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's war victims organization wrote to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
He is not a diplomat, weeks ago women offered him a meeting in Hungary that he rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no stories of love in the rape camps, and Jolie’s position on it tells the victims enough about the script.
Her organization, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended the removal of Jolie as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian ministry of culture that read the script, granted it after a strip and loosens a recording permit in Sarajevo, it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not go anyway.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, is introduced with great effort into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrific consequences of the war and give voice to all parties involved.
Its content is still inaccurate.
On the network there is a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: Lovers were together before the start of the war and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosniak, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "victim of rape falls in love with torturer".
It is certain that Jolie’s film really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
They can currently achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script continues on the network illegally, like many others before.
Nothing as far from here
This afternoon is finally going to be good for the Irish.
No trace of grief
Instead, the home team dominates its customers from Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans shout with joy as he rumbles the loud music, hitting the floor with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in South Cork, because the players are thrown, and find, pingpong balls to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a plane ticket to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this creepy drinking game and the discreet computer actually don't do good tricks.
And the 26-year-old is trying to have fun with that, distracting himself from the swirling question, what will the future hold for him?
The fun in Las Vegas is not in their plans, in January they will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
“I have a bad feeling,” he says.
"It's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "from a shot he got the job of his dreams as an event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smile.
Because of the poor outlook at home, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already looked for luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, her brother Colin currently works as an IT consultant in London.
Young people leave: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, economic experts and the social research institute ESRI in Dublin predict.
As of 2015, there are 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, a wave of migration comparable to that of the island suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis mainly confuses the young, well-trained Irish, for whom so far, everything is uphill.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of 30 are in unemployment.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and with it an entire generation.”
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union, sees a grim future emerge because the government is only engaged in montages and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they don’t have strategies to achieve new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
Notice how your peers go from unremembered practices to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this topic in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "Working AbroadExpo", a trade show that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
“For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to leading your career,” says the manager.
On its website you can see pictures of a boy surfing in Australia and of a boy playing snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleries, if not that it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year, Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O’Donovan knows what it’s like to build something else.
Since there was no longer anything to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
Now they're building a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January you go to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works overtime to be able to pay off a loan for his home in Ireland.
“The situation is a bit crazy,” he says, as it was a long time ago the first time he stepped the threshold of his house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
She laughs at something shameful and goes to cold rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with careful gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parking large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent funded by a loan.
“It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions,” he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer doesn’t like the complaints he often hears today.
“No one should go hungry, our situation is not, with much difference, as dramatic as in past times here on the island,” he says.
“Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe with it we feel like Irish for the first time.”
He laughs and tells of his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he came back and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future behind and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He worked for a couple of years in London, and why wouldn’t he and his girlfriend be fine in New Zealand?
But these days there’s one thing that worries him overwhelmingly: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid he can degenerate at a farewell party.
“Just not too much emotion,” he says and gives a great drink to his beer.
"Shut up, it sounds very distressing."
“It’s better to call it a party of walking, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games.”
The Democratic Routine
It continues to increase support for democracy in Latin America, as well as support for private companies.
Crime is more of a concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it allows monitoring of changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively mood reigning in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a large decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
Around 44 per cent of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably higher than 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (Chart 3).
Around 34 per cent said they trusted their country's Congress and 45 per cent in their government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it was maintained during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only marginally increased in 2009 and has fallen again this year, to 32 percent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since surveys began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see Figure 5).
Around 31 per cent say that either they or a close relative has been the victim of crime in the past year, a figure that has been reduced from 38 per cent last year and is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in greater support for private companies and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region claim that private companies are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56% (see Figure 6).
Around 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuelan respondents say the same thing (and 80% support private companies), although their leftist president, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the highest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered the most influential by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the trash
No one expected the general elections held on November 28 in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went a lot worse than the foreigners who were afraid of trying to help the country recover from its problems.
Votes were cast in the polls, some people voted several times, ballots thrown in the sewers, destroyed electoral colleges and acts of intimidation.
The election schools opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to figure out where to vote.
Some of them, in the end, were defeated.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the cancellation of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, stated that they were “relatively good elections in many ways.”
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said with caution that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The match is expected to take place in January.
Not all hopes have yet been lost in connection with the elections.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former First Lady, have withdrawn their initial petition requesting the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who barely has support, if he has any, has moved on to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic is ravaging the country and more than a million of the earthquake’s survivors are still living in stores, a major abstention is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents needed to vote had not yet been distributed just before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors believe that the choice of a legitimate and popular government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it has become clear, Haitians themselves think so too.
Moving from the dots to the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
In spite of everything, that can make it a successful campaign for a second term in next year’s elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who was still in charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of making budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez’s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner’s death due to a heart attack on October 27.
Some discrepant members of the powerful Peronist movement have faced Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one MP punched another in the face and other MPs accused the bribery government, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget, therefore, will apply next year, which will provide the president with an even greater margin of action when it comes to spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of the unions, place it at about 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressed the private sector and made INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez now moderate these policies?
He has called for meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps it is for this reason that Mrs Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina’s financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a forced pre-debt restructuring that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is about to enter into an agreement with the grouped creditor governments at the Club de Paris, to which she owes around $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new national consumer price index, which seems to be the prelude to cleaning the INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez wants to continue in politics when she finishes her term, given that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which he has become tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, calmly, many of your husband’s policies.
Half a hurrah for China
Taiwan voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about its big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible voters, went on Nov. 27 to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a supporter of sentiments across the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but little by little.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five elections in the city hall, it failed to get the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (PPD), which has been tilted by Taiwan’s total independence, gained almost 50% of all votes compared to 45% of the KMT.
If they had been presidents, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of his party’s votes has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the town halls.
The elections saw the typical elements of Taiwanese elections, including noisy camper vans and large crowds with banners and light-clothed girls dancing.
There was also no shortage of the mysterious attempt to murder of rigor.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or avenge the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean over the KMT.
Perhaps the only major winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not addressed.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing and job creation plans.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Therefore, the KMT often avoids advertising its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time too the PPD avoided encouraging sentiment against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
For his part, Mr. Ma claimed that it had been confirmed that his policy with respect to China was acceptable to most Taiwanese.
The Beijing government is expected to continue to overwhelm them with trade, in line with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the fold.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly like to achieve political integration as well, but the first is the first.
It is best to wait for the 2012 presidential election to pass for that.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on charges of corruption.
The President between 2000 and 2008, openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Ms. Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as a PPD candidate for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing its best to show that he can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans to create an expert group that acts as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can be conducted without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a “reliable alternative” to Mr. Ma’s precipitous approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious at the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that PPD candidates would have gone out better if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the PPD will have difficulty choosing from among its potential candidates.
The KMT should also take a conscience test.
Mr. Ma’s ratings have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT says it will restructure its cabinet as well as local teams.
Large PPD samples suggest that Taiwan’s support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, “the point of no return has already been crossed.”
Grammy nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Artist revelation.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will rely on you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the Grammys’ surprise this year with a high-level nomination in the Best Artist Revelation category.
Taking into account Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination gives what to think, but respects the rules of the Grammys according to which he must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording what "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly made a great breakthrough and, given his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with influences from pop, funk and Latin rhythms, one can at least establish a distinction between Spalding and the path to success of Norah Jones in 2003, and the latter are the most popular.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored "Historicity" by Vijay Iyer Trio, an exciting and magnificent record that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors is veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a strident New Orleans favorite and regular guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest leans considerably toward fusion as on Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society earned a well-deserved recognition in the category of big groups, competing against the great chamber jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the always-at-risk Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in best classical album direction
Nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd edition of the Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for five-movement piano and orchestra, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for three-movement eclectic orchestra.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California are Estonian composer Arvo P<0xC3><0xA4>rt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories covering orchestral, opera, choral, and solo albums.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for Symphony No. 3 and Symphony No. 4 of the Chicago Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocal
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" from the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted" from "The Enchanted"
Composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include P<0xC3><0xA4>rt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
P<0xC3><0xA4>rt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at the Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes, is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for it to be played on the Avi Avital mandolin, which played the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"It was composed with Middle Eastern sounds and numerous scales and rhythms of North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestra function category for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Nominated as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vicica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula obtains the approval of the organizing committee
The mosque project for Temecula has received unanimous support from the local ordination commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by saying it promotes terrorism and obstructions.
However, committee members decided Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be impressive from an aesthetic point of view.
“Many good people came to show their support, both Christian and Jewish or Bah<0xC3><0xA1>’<0xC3><0xAD>, of all religions,” Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center in the Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I'm proud."
“It shows that justice prevails.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he adds.
"Only they speak very loud."
“There are wonderful people in this valley.”
The meeting began at six in the afternoon and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time it was dedicated to people interceding for or against the center, almost the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“The United States no longer exists,” one comment reads.
"It's another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Liberty Dead in the Sand."
"America has fallen."
Plans to build Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, the New York area where the September 11, 2011 attacks occurred.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of nearly 135 families has been living without problems in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse he rented in a shared property with a water filtration system maker.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the Municipal Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new ways of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it demonstrates that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
“That makes it something very peculiar, although it hardly needs to be a really ‘alien’ way of life,” said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in the online edition of Thursday’s Science publication.
It has long been considered that there are six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacterium, found in Mono Lake, California, may continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“It makes you wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on different planets on Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know the aspect it has.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated great speculation on the Internet about the possibility of the report indicating the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "yes shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider essential to life may not be as fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
“This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Institute of Astrobiology, which led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one another.
“Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus.”
"As a result, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
“However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work as well as phosphorus, so it enters and, to put it in some way, it appeals to biochemical machinery,” explains Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they were able to adapt to and use to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that there can naturally exist a life form that uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example has never been found to prove it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early ages of the Earth, he noted, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
“It does suggest that there could be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The missing stolen dogs have been found in Compton.
The two dogs have been found missing from the four stolen in front of the Bellflower Motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s officials said Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck they were spending the night in, in front of Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two met Wednesday afternoon, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
"They've come back with their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is being carried out."
“We don’t want to say anything,” Whitmore said.
"We're following a few leads."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at an animal shelter in Downey County on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not suffered any damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the area competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were going to exhibit them in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the almost two-month tour that the couple makes by participating in dog competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of your room window.
They took three other dogs (a boxer's barn, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick coat and they would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
It was not clear on Thursday whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while MGM restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally achieved green light to begin again.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the “pre-armed” plan by creditors to erase approximately $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and launching movies and television shows.
Thursday’s ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to relaunch under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the top executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not exit Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a $500 million planned credit instrument to fund the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The study’s restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management needed to order their finances, while struggling to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron president and corporate recovery expert known for his work on Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to resolve MGM’s financial woes and satisfy the study’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009 the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion that the creditors sought.
Before spring of this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially exits bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper’s companies will receive multi-billion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have been collecting $375,000 a month for their company’s management services, will receive a $4 million “successful fee.”
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and brought together an annual slate of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The study requires a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debt, had been trying to settle a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep the balance of its gift budget
While the iPad is the main candidate to be this year’s most wonderful toy, followed by perhaps the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant boost in its gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five $99 BMX bikes each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump strings adorned with beads, or about 48 cans of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law has been working; this year’s tech toy will likely have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year’s.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the most well-known of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button-driven toys are on the rise, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years or more) are plush toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when their stomachs are tightened.
A squeeze is equivalent to a note, and a second squeeze begins to compose a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start to tighten, you can’t stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-change games like Sim<0xC3><0xB3>m Dice, and can make the lunar pass, thanks to its innovative articulated feet with locking device wheels.
The children who tested the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you’re an 80s kid, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and over), with a backpack full of question cards designed to turn a ride into a session with an upcoming self-correction exercise booklet.
If you are hesitant to give your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although the games don't teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, 3 to 12 years old), it's the first major tweak of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL ($90, 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and ebooks, and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a five-block game just bigger than a box of candles, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to assemble words by putting the blocks in line before time runs out; it’s formidable for an improvised word-arming competition.
There are more and more toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based solely on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you change the code online, your child gets enough credits in the Penguin Club store for two items.
These could include skates on wheels or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the bristle of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and over) is the latest in a line of button-driven microrobots.
The fake insect moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It’s fun to do a block maze to see if you can find the way out.
It is also durable.

A more moderate side of order maintenance is promoted in China
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the step in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in charge, issuing low-pitched orders with military authority.
He wanted the female members of the chengguan, the corpulent police officers of China’s urban order, feared and despised by their capricious energetic measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Signs!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "How beautiful are the girls!"
Four girls who barely passed adolescence with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed on top of hair tied with blue and white striped cuffs.
“Personally, I think they have a normal appearance,” Mr. Tang said, disdainfully.
“The models are beautiful.”
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
The province of Guangdong changed the grayish green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating looks: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a snack cart, and observed it with the frown constantly for half an hour, until the walker picked up his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen a radical change of image.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police force, specifically chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the tough police a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China’s slightest respect for these city squads.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei Province shot and killed a passerby after using his cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a Beijing inspector training manual was stolen and published on the internet, in which it was described as effectively beating criminals without causing them to bleed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon walker suffered brain damage after a row with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
“Chengguan has left a scar on the government,” lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for "a really meticulous cleaning".
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's notice called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features".
They should have a height above average, greater than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Withdrawal at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too hard for women over the age of 25.
“Your image is the important thing,” an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities."
The female Chengguan are like florists, he said, and added, "in addition to being florists, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not looking forward to supporting that description.
But he noted that the height requirements were standards in many Chinese job ads for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being bet, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not be presented.
“We cannot allow a person to cuddle or a jowl to come to work here,” Mr. Zheng said.
“Your image would not be good.”
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his cheeks colored and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn’t think the accent on her looks is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
The 21-year-old co-worker, Xu Yang, said, “Our work should present the image of the city.”
They also don’t object to their work at a given time, they said, because they harbor larger career ambitions than simply evicting sellers in the alleys where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squad faces more or less a dozen street vendors throwing themselves on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many pancakes or tofu cups as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you so many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-drawn car with bonnets.
Officials describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
“This is pretty much the same every day,” said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his spare time.
"Very routine".
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate merchandise from sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common everywhere in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, were shaken after the false rumor spread that Chengguan officials had killed a salesman.
More than a dozen Chengguan police or officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
For the time being, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But the calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle shouted roughly.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, opened their way to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men's squad, stayed behind, with his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men 40 years of age or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to keep an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. Li said with total naturalness.
“Most of the time it’s the public that starts the fight.”
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
The senator’s attorneys announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have accused Senator John Ensign of criminal charges arising from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure lobby work for the woman’s husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign’s office said it felt “certainly happy” with the decision, which came after a year-long investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no plans to raise charges against him on this issue."
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign may have confabulated to violate a federal criminal lobby ban.
Interviews, email and other documents first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get lucrative work through lobbying, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the senator’s affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find Mr. Hampton's job and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded under the law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the deal, appeared in disagreement with the so-called “revolving door lobbying ban,” which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, “it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics attorneys said the department seemed cautious about accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including filing a lawsuit against Sen last year.
Federal prosecutors “are clearly cowards,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws don’t apply to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s chief attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call the next day, telling him the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign’s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
“I don’t feel comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which claims that a $96,000 payment from Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got work through lobbying thanks to the help Ensign gave Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign’s chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him he was “smuggling” the Interior Ministry on a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a luncheon with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign's spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator expected the ethics committee to quickly follow the Justice Department's lead and complete its investigation.
“Senator Ensign is eager to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada,” he said.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the rows of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the horrific testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut family, is ready to reach an official final, with the jury-voting death penalty judge imposing.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have filed court papers that outline the arguments of the appeals that will likely occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims is that intense reports about the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created “a circus atmosphere,” and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details made public passions exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force the appeals judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
“According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual’s rights to have a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes’ chief defense attorney.
Justice Jon C. Blue, of the State Superior Court, laconically rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news media was “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury had been led by the passion.
But it probably won’t be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appellate courts have recognized that the coverage of celebrity cases can generate questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to media reports.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes’ conviction half a century later, might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There is a general reason for concern about the impact of new media” on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor who studied Connecticut’s death penalty and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the courtrooms could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many topics outlined by Hayes’ lawyers, who are likely to be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes may have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them creepy photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old Michaela.
Defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he had wrongly pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of intense process coverage can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a rebuttal to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media was continually throwing wood at the fire of emotion about the case.
“The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the courthouse,” the lawyers wrote, “was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps across the state.”
His attention on Twitter’s coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said the complaint about the fact that the immediate news was more important than the reports delivered more slowly, was a ludicrous view that would make court policy on the control of coverage weak in future proceedings.
But some lawyers said that the courts of appeal were often attracted by arguments about the adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressing for that claim.
In their writing, they referred to the Supreme Court’s 1966 decision, which overturned Dr. Sheppard’s conviction for covering the process, and made it clear that they would demand that the new media require new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century.”
Can civility stretch a bridge to unite divisions?
After a notable campaign for invective and negativity, a bit of civility has been unleashed this week in Washington.
Is it a premonition of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no progress on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But as everyone says, it was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to earn partisan points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit committee was equally civilised, despite the political differences between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is just enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a trial period, probing each other to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
The reason why Tuesday’s meeting and subsequent evaluations by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too big and they are too deep-rooted to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two sides are on opposite sides.
However, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
“There’s no doubt that things have changed regarding the way things are said,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“They are inevitable after the election.
The elections arouse partisan passions, which then become extinct.
That's good."
In some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to widening unemployment subsidies, probably because Republicans cannot make them believe they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying the unemployment subsidy for the unemployed.
Following Tuesday’s meeting at the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continuous bipartisanism when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement begins.
“After the things that must be done are carried out, in the short term psychology will reverse the situation to a confrontational one,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civility can lead to true cooperation.
“I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a test for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who decisively contributed to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they must try to live up to their promises to cut state spending and repeal the new health law.
Those lines of support are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes and retirement age, and the reduction of expenses.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been in charge of one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forcibly introduced the issue of deficit in the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials on the panel, suggesting that in tax matters there are, at least at present, little basis or desire for commitment.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of Congress.
The first will take place next year in the form of partisan shocks, when Republicans challenge Obama over budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks they are losing is likely to change course and look for commitment.
However, this can be an optimistic view.
Partisanism and polarization are now larger than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Republicans in Congress than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city’s control is in the hands of a “cleptocracy,” and leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money that collects directly from the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service handle huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each stratum of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical authority”, takes its part as the money goes up the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have systematically denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several libel lawsuits over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he said, "It's crazy, it's crazy, it's annoying."
According to the polls, the Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government to criminality have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to claim that the government works more like a kleptocracy than like a government," the statement said.
“The criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means ‘roof’ or protection) that transfers the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor’s office, as well as all sectors of the bureaucracy of the Mos government.
"Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the highest."
"The SFS, MVD and militia are on the second level."
“Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city does not provide some services.”
The report states that the SFS collects money from larger companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, the report said, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority.”
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who don’t pay quickly find their businesses closed by one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats,” said Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem expert group in Moscow, in a recent interview.
“But he is a part of this bureaucracy.”
“He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked No. 154 (countries are classified from least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. Embassy note, which did not occur until late at Moscow’s hour, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow’s weaknesses, could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed to CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously by a revelation that claimed that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest with you, we don’t suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way.”
Veterans of the Red Jemeres forced to face the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom, with stained and peeled walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalled the man who had built it, the last leader of the Ta Mok Red Jemeres.
“Everyone here loves Ta Mok.”
“He was a good leader and he cared about his people,” said 42-year-old Sring Kor Ma.
Known as "The Butcher" for his brutality during the government of the Red Jemeres, the commander remains popular in this remote former Red Jemeres fortress in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Red Jemeres to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations-Cambodia mixed court issued the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentencing the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among Anlong Veng Red Jemer veterans, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Red Jemers, but they can do nothing,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
“For them, life under the Red Jemers was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
“This is generating divisions within families.”
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease, or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government led by Pol Pot, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Jemer fighters began to defect to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieuphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of its benefactors, the oldest fighters of the Red Jemer fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite Red Jemerese officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their weapons, the racial soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
“These people have gained little profit after surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
“They were raised with no concept of doing business.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Jemers when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before devoting himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
“Life with the Red Jemeres was fine,” he said.
"Ta Mok gave him to eat everyone."
“But now life is hard because we have to self-sustain.”
The current Khmer Rouge court has also raised concerns here.
Earlier this year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Red Jemer.
The court’s mandate is to prosecute leading leaders and those more responsible for crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This did not serve much to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the reign of the Red Jemeres in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers are thought to have died.
During a recent stormy afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden pilots on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemeres.
She claimed that if the court called her she would not be presented.
“Cambodia is at peace and stable,” he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Red Jemers in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
“The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite the broken pieces,” he said.
“It is our duty to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved text book on the Red Jemeres, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education’s high school history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Red Jemeres.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know few details about the Red Jemer, despite the city's link to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,” he said.
“They have suspicions because they are not sure about the number of people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to produce an impact, he said.
However, here the Red Jemeres retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of the black hollin covered by an oxidized roof of tin.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a lot of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the side of the road, said he didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
“But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray,” he said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot’s last rest, where he would leave a handful of mature bananas in the hope of good luck.
Belarus Agrees to Resign Its Qualified Uranium Reserve for Arms
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday it will relinquish its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement published after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post they carried out a pair of operations classified with Belarus in the last two months, to remove 84.82 kg of uranium qualified for armaments from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for Wednesday’s deal to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the item.
The deal appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation summit on nuclear security chaired by Obama in April, which ruled out Belarus.
And it was obviously a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I really felt fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This demonstrates that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the deal is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have conserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically uranium qualified for armament) and low-enrichment uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material ... we’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell them to anyone.”
“We use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said he was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was made by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with low enrichment uranium research facility, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working on the Global Threat Reduction, said that “this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen confidence” that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for armaments, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reserve by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential stretch.
As progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus acknowledged that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central theme for improving bilateral relations, and is essential to the progress of the country and its citizens.
The Spanish government did not put reparations on CIA flights
The Spanish government did not repair CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners headed for Guantanamo Bay on Spanish territory, the US ambassador to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the leaked documents (cables) by Wikileaks in the newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, where it is added that the then first vice-president of the government, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that Spain exercised appropriate surveillance over the aircraft".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting took place between former US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council’s report “had caught Zapatero’s government out of the game” and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no repairs to intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
“They just want to be informed” to avoid being “unprecedented pills,” reports Aguirre on a cable.
Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, then head of Foreign Affairs, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
For his part, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez told the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge’s initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
“These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information,” the embassy said after speaking to the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. reflected its concern about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" rather than the declassified information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre laments.
In March 2007 at a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told him that "although Spanish judges are furiously jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid reflagging comments in court".
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the PP’s action on this issue.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. government," the statement said.
The Parricid Confession Complained on the Net of the "Agobio" of Being a Mother
The girl was talking about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to Galicia"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is "Muki" on the network.
With this surname, she used from a young age, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two naturals of Noia, the corona people from which she is from.
Messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonies of their relatives.
The young Galician, 30, began a relationship in 1998 with Ivan T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left, it was soon learned that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was yours, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
It didn’t take long to get to know her another boyfriend.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
He lived with them for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labor market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even came to accompany her to Palma for a week.
But by the content of the communications, it is seen that their romance broke, they broke.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and musque, because I have come to work."
“When I said it, he felt good, but of course, now he realizes what it’s like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what gives him the win.”
Then, he talks about a message to the mobile that he just received: “I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the child to you.”
She complains, “If she doesn’t like me leaving the baby with my mother, I’ll pick it up when she comes back,” she says.
In May, he spoke about his return to his people: “This week I’m going to go there, but I’ll only be until 19, because on the 20th I have to present myself to a job not to lose it.”
She explains that if all goes well, she takes her first-born.
“He’s going to be with who he should be, that is, with me, and never in life will I ever think of leaving him again with anyone other than my mother,” he said.
In July, there is another post.
When he typed it, it is assumed that the boy, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly killed on the 10th, is dead.
"Cesar is happy on the one hand, but not on the other."
“He’s with me on one side and he likes the site a little bit, but on the other he’s going to class almost every day.”
Talk about a transfer to Mallorca.
“He’ll go there to some summer classes, and so I’ll save myself some kangaroos pasta.”
On the 17th, memories and complaints.
"A very great kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
Alberto says he sent you I don’t know what videos to email, look how when he wants to find me, he has to fuck himself.”
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, go to summer classes to learn Catalan."
De V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor, his current partner, has one: "He advances me money."
On the internet there are messages on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the now intervened MySpace universe, where he was called "Muki the Excarcerator."
"Terror a la gallega (ep<0xC3><0xAD>grafe)".
The last man who lived with her, the jury, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
She doesn't want to believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica entered the provincial penitentiary of Palma, from the Menorca judicial detention centre.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the events happened, "nor did he intend to cause harm to the minor."
Earlier, he confessed that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his corpse in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
The populars would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has the view put in the general elections because, whether forward or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation gets in those elections usually double the one that it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 autonomous elections, the figure amounted to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC achieved 384,091 votes.
If this trend is kept up, which has been fed from a transfer of votes from the PSC and from the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now has 10) and for the PSC nothing.
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - now it has three - while ICV would either stay with one MP or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is to be kept, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with municipal committees, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its relief at the head of the Barcelona Diputaci<0xC3><0xB3>n, one of the most budgeted administrations for the euro - 6 million.
Both nationalists and populars agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get a majority nor the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be untenable that this formation loses its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - you need to get 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the role of the turnaround in the Tarragona capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
The popular ones have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by agents of the 2008 General Police Information Commissioner in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba's last author" (Leskar and Taiba).
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the "Operation Kampai" the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda has been "weakened" at the international level and, "therefore, its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its “combatants” can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The decommissioned cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, so investigations have involved, in addition to Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the EU territory similar strikes are being carried out in the coming days similar to those developed last night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were arrested in Thailand, another was developed with the capture of the Pakistanis Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, and Atikhar, Mohammad, Tanveer Ars and the Nigerians Ars and the Ashad and Babat, and Babat and Babatund.
These were the ones who ran from Bangkok the cell based in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was struck in 2009 - stole mainly passport tourists who met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents should be on behalf of men between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
It is underscored that, at the moment, no data linking those arrested in Catalonia to the Bombay attack has been found, although the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", was one of the groups receiving passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were “invested” in the purchase of mobile cards which were then used by members of the “command” that ended the life of 106 people.
The police have taken care of abundant documentation.
The PP demands Mas to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Artur But his conditions to support his investment as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which are summed up in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and to dispense with the nationalist adventurer who is the philo-soveranist.
The president of the popular Catalans attended the meeting of Artur Mas with the confidence that he obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, figure more than enough to make himself wanted, as the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition to abstain in the investiture vote.
A possible deal with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but, for the moment, the conversations that these days hold with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And as for the president of the PP, to support an investment “all sovereignist and independent discourses will have to be parked”, as well as the economic concert – similar to that of the Basque Country – that the convergent leader intends to even submit to a referendum.
Both leaders have in common their commitment to thinning the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and eliminating the tax on successions and donations.
The details of the negotiation on the investment of Mas will be dealt with, by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do so with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that their locker would kill more than 11 elderly
The head of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while there was employed killed at least eleven elderly people who were in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared along with the lawyer of the center, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to carry out the charge against the responsible" of the deaths but "legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And it is that in addition to the social disparity that the entity may suffer from not having detected in time the criminal activities of the cellist, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims’ relatives are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but that, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was sent off by phone.
La Caritat, through its director, flatly denied this extreme yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of action cannot at any time have been the cause of what has happened".
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “there is not a single indication in the case that there has been reckless action by anyone other than the defendant himself.”
The already-baptized "Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders yesterday and detailed that the first crime committed on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by pinching an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed using a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center have access to the medicines.
The pinching of insulin and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his eagerness to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to give them death.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify if Vila does not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he hugged them inside giving them reading as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the demonstrations of the cellist, not even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that it is superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the small sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after he has committed, successfully, eight asesin.
That’s why they say they make themselves available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB's threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet’s threat warning that “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
Peripheral differentials have closed sharply and the shares of European banks have risen by more than 5%.
However, we must also not underestimate the ECB’s ability to be wrong and the euro has barely bounced back, which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is peculiar to an illiquid market that just as it collapses it recovers but is motivated by the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose the fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded that the public debt purchase plan be terminated for inefficiently and eliminate all extraordinary liquidity measures on time and leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we hope to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also expect them to continue with their bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they are still obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God help us!
As in their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even contemplated the purchase of bonds and collapsed the markets, tomorrow could repeat the story.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, the bazooka announced Monday and said Wednesday it had already bought a lot, causing a new market collapse.
Yesterday the one-year letter auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment following Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potentials and have until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are admissible within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it still does not have enough support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension in the face of the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which a political commitment is needed that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven’s joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of opportunity by presenting yesterday the plan of measures that will be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has increased by 4.5%, twice that of the rest of European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been fast and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key three-year bond auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will resolve with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain, asking for an aid plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don’t need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available triple that in March, at expensive rates and closes you access to the markets sine die.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being, seeming so."
Cheers, we can.
Eulen's president will challenge the board of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The temporary does not shy away from the open conflict in the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, by considering it a “full-fledged void”, the court of El Enebro on the next day 16, requested by five of its seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and make themselves with the management bodies of the holding firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their lawsuit for control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding company does not seem willing to give in his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was beheaded by five of his seven children who were appointed administrators at the shareholders’ meeting on January 18 of this year and whose challenge is noted in the Mercantile Register.
The junta of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantile No. 2 in Madrid, has again opened the box of the trout in the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The judge's recourse to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants their five children to, through procedural argument, in clear fraud of law and abuse of law, try to validate and sanitize the board officially null in their 18th gate."
This argument will be the basis for the Board, once it has been held, to proceed to its challenge in considering it to be a "full-fledged void".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already unsuccessfully tried to have the magistrate convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a patrimonial society and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez’s seven children control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group claims, however, the usufruct over 51% of the capital, according to the family protocols.
This issue is the substantive issue that the judge must decide once the view on the appeal is held, for which there is not yet a specified date.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software design improvements in cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the Formula 1 world in 2004, its history in this select speed universe has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into account the options of a newly arrived squad and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship everyone bet for the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without neglecting the ability to drive the ultimate champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine to propel his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that Germany put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from the high automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design assembly chains for manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding errors and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry out “in a few hours, almost in real time” the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the squads in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all sorts of modifications in the bolts.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull’s bolts except the engine, which is Renault’s entire responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be brought from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological improvement is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as much as possible in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has assembled the high-tech factory to design and produce its pellets in a locality about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret".
The squad for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull's Formula 1 is undoubtedly the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists whose contest is priceless and its notoriety null.
Steve Nevey, the factory’s chief technology officer, says five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in spool cars accounted for 50% of victories and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology adds up to 85% of success, while the drivers contribute 15% of added value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install 20 stores of its own with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes in Barcelona yesterday.
This will be the first of the network of 20 stores of between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will align this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, set as an example the remodeled store located on the Gran Via Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes all 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
HP’s director of personal systems said the philosophy for installing the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with industry experience and knowledge.
The American group advises and takes care of the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the establishment staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive retail network aims to “improve customer service and SMEs in buying, care, after-sales and even packaging.”
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program at a global level that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP’s computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
“So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days.”
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, as large companies already have contracted technical assistance services," Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell to ‘steal’ one million customers from its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and Vatican the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it foresees a fall in interest margins, which will try to compensate in part with commission increases and the price of the credit.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years one million private customers, its outstanding subject matter.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 that will be valid for three years.
The goal, in addition to surviving without resorting to FROB’s public aid, is to gain market share with the acquisition of one million new private customers – 700,000 if discounted those who can leave the bank – its great subject pending, as until now it had more mimicked SMEs and companies than the retail client.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with reduced costs as a target, and whose challenges the bank will expose when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks in these times dare to set goals and make them public as the financial crisis has transacted all the plans of the world bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will close his Optima management plan, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation has made it expand one more exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main goal.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 is going to be a "difficult and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be “very difficult to create employment,” something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the passive war – which penalizes margins – is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that are paying banks and cash for their emissions to obtain liquidity is already shifting to the price of credit to offset the fall in margins.
“The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it’s going to be a pressure factor on credit.”
“We haven’t closed the tap, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto already gave orders to his network on Thursday to limit the long-term credit and raise the price of the differentials -see Five Days of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the bank’s trend is now “rising commissions,” but “there is a competitive framework.”
Sabadell’s management plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
In Spain, he says, “larger sizes are going to be required.”
“The next year everything is going to move,” he said.
He claims that capital needs are "highly high" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial entity goes into red numbers.
And he points out that FROB can supply the market in raising funds for new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it remained important to what some bankers already regard as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which dampens the crisis.
ECSC dismisses second wave of mergers in boxes
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out that a wave of savings box mergers is going to occur and insisted again on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings boxes began, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the general director of the Confederaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ola de Cajas de Ahorros (ECCA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
“I think the biggest part of the mergers has been made, Cajasol’s incorporation into the Civic Bank group can’t be said to be a second round, which are adjustments.”
“Most of it is completely done; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the great processes have already been done and protected by the Bank of Spain, which has contributed a lot in that as well,” he said.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Arag<0xC3><0xB3>n (ADEA), Olavarrieta has stated that the concentration process is taking place "at the fastest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is going to happen in the deadlines that in its day, not now, were marked in the business plans with Banco in Spain.
“To move from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion assets to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no precedent in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unlucky opinions on the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" the world, and attributed it to those who put it on trial a "lack of knowledge".
The director pointed out that, within the current economic environment, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a "most important" concentration process and that "goes at the fastest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank came out very well of the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but has set the conditions for the whole of the Union.
Tensions in the markets have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private agencies for the placement or abolition of the 426 euros of aid to non-delivery stops, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, has joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It goes without saying that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which collides with keeping the old traditions of much of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany begins to speculate about the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals of greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines to the transgressing countries, possible suspensions of payments of some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German government pulled out of the manga a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans of fiscal rigor and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the front gave it to the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended Greece’s bailout decision.
Already then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published one were very against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union treaties, to make possible the salvation of a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should be attending the process of reforming the Union that will make those measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it is telling us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not agree very well, from that date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the offender countries will be severely punished, may be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run with part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out to us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand it.
It’s not just about resuming the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they demand from us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that current turbulence will lead to greater peace of mind.
And let us take advantage of the window of opportunity that they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with the big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the thesis has opened the way for a home order.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it doesn’t seem like they’re going to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are contemplated, that of leaving a monetary zone too crowded with unserious countries cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and Fraud Law
Trets like those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax show ingenuity but unwillingness to escape a sanction.
The expulsion allegedly struck by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match played on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether or not such behavior is anti-sporting and if, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As is well known, after a few minutes to finish the game (which his team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately wasted time on taking missing paths to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will end up as leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction of the next match of the league, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean cards to the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee has sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two matches and different economic amounts to the players involved.
Provoking a yellow card in circumstances like this or the like is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the rules not written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the reported case is due to the fact that it has been starred by a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem presumes of nobility and honor, and which in the past has fined its players for similar acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who has a history of more than one.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions are committed by fraud of law; in fact, they are actions respectful of the sport regulation, but seem to elude its meaning.
The issue is to examine the type of damage that causes the sports spirit.
One of the assets that the sports spirit understands is the physical integrity of the opposing players, which with these actions was not jeopardized, i.e. there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that is alluded to with clean play is to prevent the team of the infringing players from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which did not happen either.
Now, the paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not fit what we normally characterize as cheating or law fraud, because their violation of the rules was not made hidden to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely their action tried to be the most obvious in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders get in the intentional faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that it is not put in a disadvantage to the opponent or profit in the same game, since obviously the result of the action is to leave the team itself with fewer players.
And it is also not a useful strategy for the next game, as the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that may threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, as the team can be eliminated at the first exchange, and in addition with this performance players fulfill a penalty match and pass to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, going through rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the spirit of sport, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that make the most of what the rules allow.
In our case, players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without winning the punishment or running away from it.
Although the border between ingenuity and fraud law is diffuse, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because it was two self-exclusions and the way in which the transmission of the directive was carried out to provoke them.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive to pick up group Christmas dinners in BCN
The calendar dictatorship this year focuses an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
Self-sustained celebrations proliferate by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the bulls and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have resulted in an offensive of adjusted prices in order to be able to catch the customer in the majority of 20 people.
In order to complicate accounting, this year’s calendar (as New Year’s Eve fell on Friday) has concentrated requests in the week of December 13, with the result up to the date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (16th and 17th) and barely moving for the previous week.
As has already been happening since 2008, when the stage of lean cows began, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners on a budget basis.
In order not to disregard tradition, many workers keep it paying off their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, some and others demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Barcelona Restoration Committee, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The representative of the boss, to this day, does not dare to Vaticanize what the festivities of this month will be like.
“People think about it a lot before they book.”
“He wants to go out but he has the alerts on the price issue,” he says.
The business will be good "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so the band around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
A survey in several central establishments shows the collapse of petitions for the night of the 17th.
In the Soteras group they indicate that there is a real demand boom for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the setting, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has brought more advance booking, even since early November.
"We have done the impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they said.
In AN Grup, which flags El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locations, they remain optimistic after detecting an increase in turnover from the second half and some good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
The group’s sources point out that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays.
Their six group menus have added one Christmas, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a willingness to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green shoots in some companies that re-invit their employees and feel that the volume of the groups is somewhat higher.
On behalf of the patron Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Association of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, is confident to start seeing the end of the tunnel and maintains that together the reservations are "animated", although customers "negotiate as much as possible".
That is, the illusion of the festivities has not come down, pay who pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program causes great concern in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at “a faster pace than any other country.”
Wikileaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
Aside from the enlightening and judicious details they offer about the content of the talks and thoughts of US diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in terms of atomic security, rather than going up, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons than any other.
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program — which weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to make it difficult to destroy in the event of an attack — is one of the main reasons for the revelation in Washington.
This is what Ambassador Anne W. Patterson lists in a report prior to the visit of then National Security Advisor James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials, and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials.”
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is contemplated, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferator and reason to keep the guard.
“Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs,” Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said at a meeting.
The most recent of the documentation leaked through the Julian Assange portal is the ever-decreasing cooperation between the U.S. and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and Pakistan’s high pace of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy dispatch in May, which called communication with Pakistan “frustrating,” said: “Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers are left unanswered or discarded.”
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a South Asian National Intelligence official, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during an army chief's visit, General Ashfaq Kayani, to leave "very clear" to the head that "Pakistan's army must end tacit support for terrorist groups."
In the hunt for the Wikileaks boss
Obama has appointed a senior counter-terrorism official to prevent further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to track the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be sure about the facts.
Interpol issued a “red alert” yesterday to “locate and follow the movements” of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Also, it is not new, but dates from November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks creator's lawyer Mark Stephens said that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
It was on the 20th when the international police body based in Lyon (France) ordered the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications of identifying or locating Assange “with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization, do consider the so-called network of free notices to proceed with an arrest - which must be undertaken by the national police body - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sue Ing.
The move has angered Assange’s lawyers, who published a letter yesterday denouncing that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder has been willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities by videoconference.
They also remember that Assange applied for and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, compared to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s head of security.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal chase," the mission said.
As the world searches for him – and from Australia his mother defends her son’s innocence – Assange remains in an unknown but not silent whereabouts.
On Monday, he gave an interview to Time magazine director via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for ordering American diplomats to spy on the United Nations in violation of international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request “ridiculous and absurd.”
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has charged a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, with preventing further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to remain important to Assange contrasts with opinions that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house from January, has asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations “to intervene and their funds and prosecute anyone who helps them out of any contribution or assistance.”
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, has gone further and has had to retreat after saying that Assange should “be killed.”
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned aircraft or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former Arkansas governor and potential presidential candidate.
“Anyone in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment,” he said.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seeks peace in ERC with guinea pigs
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found the recipe to draw the eleventh internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without north for the loss of 11 deputies and half the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his secret of resignation is insufficient for the likes of former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can cause him at all the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will try to win the new critics with guinea pigs that will allow him to shield himself up to municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s announced yesterday that the more than 200 national advisors of ERC will be able to speak about their continuing in secret.
By hand, not by hand.
If the Carodists want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of rows wants to avoid the image of division as much as submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that he would not consider himself to be ratified with half another one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that it would also not be a good result "to the Bulgarians".
Those close to Carod demand the president more than to make his position available to the militia, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But because they do not have enough majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap from here to May.
To that end, they hope to participate in the drafting of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the National Council on the 18th.
His intention is to endorse Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s in exchange for his promise to advance the congress in the fall of 2011, something that the summit already does.
The ERC leader acknowledged that “polyphony” harms stability and that its goal is to make the organization once and for all able to wash dirty doorsteps inward.
In this line, it is symptomatic of the article that the functionary Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s’ ideologist, the head of Innovation said that the leader will be restrained “in exchange for various goals.”
And he numbered five of them, of whom were two.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, i.e. to include new faces coming from the sector close to Carod.
The second can be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC immediately liquidate assemblyism as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it proposes a reform of the statutes that allows congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the conclave of 2008 left the direction of revising the assemblyism at a specific convention on statute reform.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years was advising against dealing with the matter.
Now, without critical sectors on the horizon, it can be a good time to pick it up again and try to close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the MILENIO State of Mexico count, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to the content of MILENIO State of Mexico.
Among the murders are that of three women and the discovery of a pair of fenced bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, 390 deaths are alleged to be related to organized crime.
Among the cases is that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three firearm shots and a grace shot in the head in addition to his feet and hands tied with wire.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas street, in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatl<0xC3><0xA1>n, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
In the early hours of Thursday four, ejidators found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal gunshots to the chest, on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway, on the stretch that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was a message allegedly signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl, a 50-year-old gentleman, he was killed by eight bullets after leaving his house to start garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a bullet to the head in San Pedro Xaloxtoc, Ecatepec.
In Chalco, the body of a man was found on a lonely road in the Colony of El Naranjo and under the body they found a helmet struck with a 25-caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the colony Playa Golondrina.
Urgent bodies performed a thorough search of the other members of the body, however they were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n warned of the discovery of a body found in the Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada, which was tied from the hands back and with its head sold.
The man had a gunshot wound to his neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men, who were wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the fractional Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Atizap<0xC3><0xA1>n of Zaragoza, along with the victims were also discovered two messages of death warnings.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony was found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in hives, two women were found dead in the village of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning was located the body of a man in Huixquilucan who was wrapped in a yellow hive with blue, allegedly identified with the name of Mario Rios according to his message.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots to the neck, was found the lifeless body of a woman in the village of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman tattoos of the Holy Death were detected, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the last part of the month, a man’s body was found on board a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three gunshots and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a pair of men with their heads clasped and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said, "This happens to those who don't line up."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and hand-to-foot ties, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n Colony Justice Center.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first of them was decapitated in the Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n knife colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon tape and next to a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag on the streets of the Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez Colony.
Next to him the agents found a postcard with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The country’s representative at COP16 said his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and said it supports its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community on this issue.
He noted that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four sections: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and pilot programme support.
In all of these areas, progress has been made, including last year's adoption of a new Energy Law, which sets out the objectives of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated way with state and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, several multi-year plans are underway or have already been completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments from other countries.
For example, he reported, the Energy Efficient Use Program, which was implemented over the past five years and which received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for the change of incandescent focus by savers and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific adviser to the country’s government on climate change, said China’s efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, he said, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as 20 percent increase in energy efficiency over the past five years and plans to do another both by 2020, he said.
Attached to the legality of Espino's expulsion: César Nava
The National Leader of the PAN detailed that the former Panist leader is entitled to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, said that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was tied to legality and that the former leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what suits his right.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo’s protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case Espino’s expulsion is a decision made at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order of Sonora Commission."
“Mr. Espino has his right to go, where appropriate, to the National Council’s Committee of Order by complaint, in such a way that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body,” he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that never was on the negotiating table an alliance for the presidential candidacy.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez said he was convinced that National Action will be strengthened from the internal election on December 4 and 5, in which he will have to choose his successor.
“That (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach for the local election that was successful and met the goal,” he said.
The Panist leader pointed out that the PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; at the same time "we enjoy and strengthen it", he said.
He said that the council will undoubtedly know how to choose the best or the best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, hence he will deliver the badge "to whom the council determines."
"I have that absolute peace and openness, to any of the five I would be proud to hand over to you the office of the party president."
He predicted that the rebound that registered the game in the last elections of July 4 will be reflected in the next contests, although "it's not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now, it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, hence "a lot of hopes, aspirations are placed on them, and I am sure Gabino will be up to expectations".
When asked about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n for his speech during the four years of his government, César Nava called on the priests to reflect on the sexes of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n; let them start defending them; let them get out of the closet,” he said.
He said that the head of the federal executive can make expressions like those he did in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there is no bite or much less censorship in the country.
Obama promotes Twitter law in favor of undocumented students
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and install them to pass this legislation,” the president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and install them to pass it,” Obama tweeted.
Their brief message keeps open a cyber link with a broader document that asks the public to immediately communicate with senators, given that the vote of the legislation is imminent.
“With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,” he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote from any legislation, unless the extent of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding is approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to solve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
“I think we can make a deal at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would call for a “debate closing vote” for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or American Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before age 16, have remained in the country for the past five years, and entered an institution of higher education or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, so they require the contest of a handful of Republicans, at a time when the project’s party organizations play an intense role in ensuring the passing of the law.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
That’s why supporters of the Dream Act require adding several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are the senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have said they will not back it another time.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his stance at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the wound
The second round of The Pleasures of Language was a walk where the participants made the narration gala
"That of the sex in the language I understand but... the finger in the fight? what is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this occasion he used the subtitle of his question (in another edition of El serdo la table).
The finger on the bat... "puts us in a pinch", the Argentine writer gently told the public, mostly of young people, who were given a meeting at the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez, Lura Mayro and Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "slag" is, goes to a doctor in a doctor, from whom she does not get answers even if clues on the same narrative thread.
The infectologist is convinced: “Patience is not my strength, maybe it’s my soreness.”
In the end, after a frustrated rapprochement with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the hallway, but who explains to him that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "I just got to know that it's the real open and it doesn't exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must go very intertwined.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also exposed a delightful narration entitled "Elogio of the Invention", where the finger in the wound is not named but at some point it is discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, the account of a famous witch, who also played clouds, brought back men who had gone far away or repaired the virtues that a maiden had lost, a narrative that turned to speak then America, the great novel that had not been missing from the beginning, and the chroniclers who told their own stories from the beginning.
“Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise he would never have come to tell the story of America with the imagination that he lacked to the point of smell.”
However, he stressed "it is the madmen and the mobs who best imagine" and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that the narrative belongs to one gang or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
In fact, it is called the "Cervantine Tradition."
“By his inheritance we are what is counted.”
In her turn, writer Mayra Montero embraced and applauded the variety of interpretations that led to the FIL’s invitation with her round table The Finger in the Battle.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed his to the great scourge of social violence that crosses his country – and shares Latin America – as a result of the traffic and drug sales disputes.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs seal a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," he said, citing that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and reader, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero, whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the sword of the committed writer of the writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual customs and control of consciousness that results in dogmatisms, forgetting “that behind every claim there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes”.
“To own our thoughts and to own reality, we have to inculcate: and inculcate means many times putting our finger on the bat and harassing those who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nudity, and also harassing the powers who prefer a world in black and white,” he said.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had highs in his career, but he has managed to reach the decisive series three times already.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who encounter each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had highs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series three times, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has finished consoling himself with the medal of the sub-champion, he has stayed a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he has played consecutive finals.
The strategist reached his first final as coach in the 2002 Apertura Tournament, when he led the Morelia races with which he fell 4-2 overall against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closure he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with a 3-1 overall and was just ahead of Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén again suffered a setback, as his team finished tied 2-2 in front of the scorers after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he put himself ahead 3-1 with two chances to seal the title from the last three players his 11 missed.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he does not want to run the same luck, seeks to get rid of the evil and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he claims that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for an aficionado that I owe myself to and therefore the title will come to me, but the above is the most important thing," he said.
He said: “The only lesson we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can’t party, we’re ready on the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties to throw, we were already ready to run out and I think that’s a lesson we can end up playing.
But knowing that this series could be defined in penalty shootouts, something that does not bother him, because something was trusting his players: "One never seeks to get to the penalty shootout, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately in the end it made us feel bad for the fate, it made us a bad game, unfortunately it made us bad time to play, it, it, it,
Romano has in his hands to stop being a sub-champion and test for the first time the glory that the titles give.
EU changes rules to get visa
People must go to the Visa Application Service Centers prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower as well as the waiting time.
Starting January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the U.S. Embassy and consulates will be changed.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take biometric information from the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, you will no longer need to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another one for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a one-time payment covering all three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas on request (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken at the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this less time than in the past.
Likewise, those applying for visas at the Consulates in Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency quoted the press as presenting a finding tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will unveil an astrobiological discovery on Thursday that could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The finding will be presented at a press conference on Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA’s Washington headquarters by astrobiology experts, science described as being in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In citing the press, NASA said it would present "a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", sparking speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures next to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they become intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and from this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that “there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know.”
The space agency will reveal the true scope of the findings at the press conference on Thursday.
The conference will feature geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), under the prospect that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and 'block' pattern opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it leads to the arrival of 'bipartisanism', they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of ‘bipartisanism’ in the House.
Before the start of the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, ‘crowded’ against the reform of the Organic Law, as it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it initiates ‘bipartisanism’, because now there will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the panelist Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that these reforms institutionally constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He said that in the coming days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be defeated again by both parties and with this the opposition coalition was ended.
“So far it has come (the opposition coalition), that’s what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, from Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n, there are coincidences and that is why they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now "dupoly".
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipathy in Congress.”
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking to other peers to be more, the convergent abounds.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that currently Congress has become a 'button' between two, in reference to the PAN and PRI.
“Once it was just a game, now it’s being split between two.”
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, asked to respect the MP's personality, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That not by cupular agreements, we leave out 5 that we are probably going to make 9 MPs, save the five who see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unite to look for a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform they made that they agreed, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200,000 more for “supplier”
Pay Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n City Council another check to the questioned company owner of electrical material.
A check of just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the company of electrical material, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "account settlement to be paid".
Treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno had predicted that more money would come out of the municipality in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Auditorium for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed and, therefore, how many more checks are missing for issuing in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing has been bought, it’s just being paid what’s owed, just like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official State Gazette, as the Law states when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer said they have not used their services again.
The above, after that on 25 July, Noroeste published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, in the triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the municipality of 42 million pesos.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgent attention to tourist sites
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor conditions of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
Following the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and reverse the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the bad state of the streets and the banquets has affected because tourists come to walk and see the mess and take the turn to nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to shut down a company one day and have no idea of the money being lost, or else they wouldn’t do the work this way in so much time and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it by giving preventive maintenance and not just falling into the corrective," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be given maintenance, but as residents we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also look neglected and incomplete, he said, such as the Escudo and the Venadito de Mazatlan.
"Today, for the tourist to come does not depend solely on promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what tourist attractions are," he said.
"No proper attention has been given and this kind of fact highlights something that is notorious for everyone, maintenance is needed."
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, Deputy Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, as they are not used properly and project a bad image.
It talked about a number of places that should be put online together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, tidy and that is attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
“Luckily Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive to be able to add to the inventory we have to promote to the destination.”
Request IP Results to Congress
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, president of the CCE, proposed that MEPs assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A Labour Legislature worthy of agreement between parties and the state executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsive Sinaloa facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60 legislature, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM, was installed, adding a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they will carry out a clean and committed management with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partyism or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly-released 40 members of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
“We hope that the deputies will actually exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is custom that they make arrangements to safeguard their own interests and become carnival parlors of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions.”
Hence, he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that move the Governor forward in turn.
“We look forward to doing a decent job and above all committed to society and the sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections.”
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they push economic growth, which generates incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage job creation.”
As for the tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight he puts into the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
“I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the lower-budget state and it is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that directly competes with the agricultural industry.”
In addition, it is required to label resources for detonating tourism projects that help in providing security to the state and in updating the Alcohol Act that have not been able to be resolved in previous legislatures.
Looking for a Magical King
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next King’s Day will be difficult to please their illusions, as their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a chivalry.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family live in a humble home in the Salvador Allende Colony and live up to date because the father does not have a fixed job.
“Because sometimes we see it hard because my husband doesn’t have chamba, but we sell mandarin and papa... already in the afternoon I go out with the ‘plebes’ to sell on the street,” said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the children.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, Jose Alfredo, 10, long aspires to have a ‘monster’ car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I told him 'let's go see son', because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For older children, those who were in school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, is size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, uses size eight.
José Juan, 14, is missing tennis, so a pair of sizes five and a half or six would be a lot of help.
If you want to help make the children's dream of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can take part in the Seeking a Magical King campaign by donating a toy or cash at the North West reception.
Thirteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions have been made as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various charges.
Persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production have been seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Quebec Security Department.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear in the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of his arrest.
They could face allegations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to carry out the arrests," Mr Ruel said.
About seventy officers from the Quebec Security Strike Investigation Module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
It will be possible to fight illegal migration without problems.
The Conservative bill, which, according to the Government, should solve the problem of the fathers loaded with clandestine migrants, will surely face a great opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely primarily on the Charter."
“I’m here with a party that has created the granite you’re pissing,” said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also said he could not support the bill because he pointed to the wrong target.
"We are against and, it seems, all opposition parties are against the project, so we will already see what the government is doing," Duceppe said.
The NPD’s immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, has staunchly rejected criticism that her party is not strong enough with illegal immigrants.
“The neo-democrats agree that measures are being taken against those in charge of clandestine patrons and that’s what we intend with another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the parties of the position of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs they don’t tolerate this type of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada, and they treat the country as if it were a fur.”
“They expect Canada to take firm action,” Minister Kenney said.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its draft law, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the government would request a vote to be held so that each MP who would oppose it would then be explained to their constituents.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Although the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit by Jean Charest had been announced, numerous observers continued to call for the establishment of a public consultation committee on the issue.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil argues that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation on the issue since January last year.
The metropolis has a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
As a result, Tuesday’s announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It should be said that, during a Permanent Council meeting on Quebec police services held on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the Quebec party critic dealing with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to classify this ad as "a rabbit pulled out of the barn" and as "a last-minute hatchery solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on possible future unity.
“You’ll see the results when we announce it,” he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ president Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
“The more Mr. Charest resists the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, he has something to hide,” he explains.
“The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this dead end, he suggests that Quebec grant a special mandate to the general interlocutor to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
“We must be able to extend the mandate of the general intervener,” he concludes.
He also believes that Quebec could give the intervener the same powers as a commissioner, thus forcing people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Penal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in this type of investigation.
Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed for his part that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this issue.
During Operation Spring 2001 related to motor groups, although the Penal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Later, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Act on Gangsterism.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several water courses are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that have been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a precautionary measure, they have been evacuated from homes.
In the evening, another landslide occurred at Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Also, between 20 and 40 additional millimeters are expected from now to Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations add to the snow melt that had already accumulated in certain sectors, various rivers are feared to overflow.
On Wednesday night, Quebec’s Civil Security unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentides, and of the Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne, in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several routes, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security Unit remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Growth Forecast Center, for its part, issued announcements on Wednesday communicating the strong growth of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Partially Guilty of Dupont
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered some setbacks before the Canadian Council of Radio Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance and about Haitians, as well as for their rude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained “inaccurate information about social assistance, an unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day.”
The Council has also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two people who had committed suicide, do not violate the codes on broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front of People receiving Quebec’s social assistance.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters must communicate reliable data and not lead to deception.
In relation to suicide, the presenter Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes cited in Dupont le midi have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Therefore, any blame has been cast in this regard.
The last dispute referred to the statements made after the Haiti earthquake.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had starred in a media confrontation that had sparked numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help the Haitians because he could not know for sure if the needy were really going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already fulfilled my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issue of coarse language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio network has collaborated “even more than required.”
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, which will, among other things, have to announce the decisions once in the hours of the largest hearing within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montereles of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar route.
The athlete, who stands out in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing, climbs the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” said Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
“In my case, I’m looking for fights everywhere because, for those who don’t enjoy the game on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America.”
The athlete, who works as a security agent and employee of the company UPS, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championship, held from October 23 to 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I have won in the kickboxing categories full contact and Thai boxing,” he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the World Cup of san shou in China".
"They will invite athletes who have finished among the top four positions in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, gané la medalla de bronze en Toronto".
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place".
“In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but reached third place in Toronto in 2009,” he added.
“The interesting thing is that I’ve been progressing in every competition.”
"At this stage, I'll be the first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sand" is a discipline originating in China in which it is allowed to hit with fists and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
The clashes are originally held on a platform and, less often, on a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the Vietnamese-American Cung Le, widely recognized in the martial arts world.
Although Nacer Zemmal only has to maintain a competition in his career, he will certainly go to the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the kung-fu Super Bowl.
“This competition is the most famous and prestigious in China,” explains the friendly boy.
“It’s like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand).”
“It has been an incredible experience.”
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
“The one who has won me is a real professional,” he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals face off in the final of their category."
“Then the champions of each category face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu.”
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, the project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec’s decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the consortium <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance obtained the lucrative contract without a prior public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause price rises.
"This is a new method of collusion and of eliminating competition."
"That is, the people, instead of doing it in secret, are now doing it openly," Quebec Party MP Sylvain Simard said at a news conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he claims, he does not understand how the public interest can be benefited in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was a collusion with this contract.
“I’m starting to get tired,” he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted in a “dishonest” and “lack of rigor.”
He pointed out that "the minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
Typically, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been awarded without the competition coming into play; it has been a negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the standard in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula of consortia in the technical consulting sector is being subjected to an investigation in the government.
A quick look at Quebec’s trade register allows you to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
As regards the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau has pointed out that "the territory of James Bay responds to a particular labor dynamics and Hydro-Québec responds specifically to it since the 1970s".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d’energie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that he has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
“If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices will be higher.”
“You have two options: you can get in touch with the players in the sector and tell them: we’re going to negotiate a satisfactory deal and at a good price.”
“However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people,” Mr. Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advice contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Genivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Energy Management Contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has made it clear that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has let down that the PQ is also linked to these companies, who “finance” it, before specifying that it is rather about their leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The label "green" does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply sceptical.
The Quebec consumer hardly trusts the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trade marks or ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Responsible Consumption Barometer, the first results of which were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where they pile up messages that defend more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even slows down their commitment.
Even if it has increased the consumption of so-called “socially responsible” products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption at the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates bearing so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "equorable," the Barometer notes.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians’ speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the dubious nature of information make 46% of consumers want this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they also distrust the supposed returns of the ecological products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, nearly half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their beliefs.
61% have given priority to shopping in stores in their neighborhood and have preferred to buy food grown in their region, says the Barometer.
More green and responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points over a maximum of one hundred this year), the Quebec Homo consumus loves to occupy the position of recycling king who tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about wildlife protection.
However, according to the Barometer, that social consciousness seems to be door-to-door: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared a car to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of participants in this broad behavioral survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of bicycles and walking trips.
A loan for the state to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex after the Société Angus and the Parallel, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, who were expecting a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to repurchase Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and return him his true cinematic vocation, have not obtained what they requested.
The Government has agreed to engage in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would, in fact, be below initial expectations; it could be a viable solution under favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million last spring, but since then requests have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier, referred a proposal and an action plan to the Minister of St-Pierre.
He sent you a final report a decade ago.
However, SODEC received a counter proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a state donation must be completely discarded.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Film Complexes of Quebec opposed a direct investment by the state to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not fund real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector are demanding considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the film, has spent ten years loading the author's film in his premises of the complex, after funding his own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to loyalize its clientele.
The company Angus and Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, led by Christian Yaccarini, are pushing for a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to pave the way for the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, continues to project films on eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, projecting Xavier Beauvois' precious film "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group of proposals have received.
Canada's full-blown veil is lifted...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. sees as the complex of Canadians with respect to Americans, but at the same time reflect the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don’t think about Canada-U.S. relations when they go to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A September 22, 2008 cable, that is, during the full federal election campaign, tells how far the United States does not get into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused a great surprise to the U.S. Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations about this situation.
“Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of inferiority virtually inherent to Canadians when it comes to dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about."
The ambassador has even more problems in understanding this “sorrowful silence” because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“Logically, I think a candidate’s ability, a party’s ability, and even more, the head of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when it comes to voting.”
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“His trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will for the first time record a deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40,000 billion,” Breese writes.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent the coalition from being replaced or that opposition parties conditional their survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington about the increasingly negative image that broadcast the dramatic series broadcast on the CBC of the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the issuance of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which unsubtle references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even kidnappings for the CIA to carry out vigorous interrogations.
Another cable says that during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that he did, but that it depended "on each case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has handed over a document to the Secretary of State in connection with Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretariat agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the spirits have been warmed up in connection with the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "killed".
In the United States, Mike Huckabee echoes.
A Global Plan to Renovate Lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in a hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) in an amount that corresponds to almost a third of the additional decrease that must be carried out to stabilize the planet’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major concrete projects that the UN expects to be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1.8 billion tons of emiluminated (Gt) of the planet would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary automotive park.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of that amount should be further reduced to stabilize, by 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees centigrade to prevent it from being out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is further reduced by twice.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a lifespan of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which allows us to make an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
Above, they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have expressed their reservations regarding the fluocompact bulbs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers place instructions.
However, the report states, the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not the fluocompact bulbs, but the coal thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is shed with the incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages this international program would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save a billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, i.e. the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire eagerly awaits the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the “immediate” publication of the results of the presidential elections in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire, as deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General highlights the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
“It calls on all parties in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced.”
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the deadline from Wednesday to midnight to pass without the results being published, three days after Sunday’s scrutiny.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the president of the CEI had commented to television that the commission “continued to work” to announce the results.
On Wednesday, requests for the IOC to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara have multiplied in the world.
However, the Gbagbo gang has the constitutional council's annulment of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the old New Forces (FN) rebellion since the failed September 2002 coup.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the Ivory Coast president's campaign, said that the maneuvers of intimidation of voters carried out by the UN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepts the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
Gbagbo’s opponents now consider the country’s highest court not to be neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged “unacceptable” the delay in publishing the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim the victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have put the blame on the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided in two years ago.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the political class in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the vote against Alassane Ouattara’s 32%, who received publicly the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% in mainland territory (9.7% taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected with the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) published Thursday by the Insee.
The number of stops remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
Data from the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the active population in mainland territory and 9.7% with DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but want to work, be available in the two weeks to work and look for employment or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with the unemployment rate rising again to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the ILO’s direction.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points both in three months and in one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, which amounts to 6.6% with DOMs.
Unemployment has only been stable among people aged between 25 and 49, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% across France.
The Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (including DOM) in October, after a 9.9% rate in September.
Alexandre Guerini Investigated and Arrested
Alexandre Guerini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the prison of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guerini is being investigated for abuse of social assets, misappropriation of funds and public assets, cover-up, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
“Alexandre Guerini will fight and answer all the questions asked by the magistrate, not ghosts.”
“It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to prove them,” his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP ahead of his client’s appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the leader of the PS in the department, Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, has wanted to pass through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and imprisoned one of their close people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing his client has done has been to deal with the dumpsters he must manage.
As for the assignment of the contracts or the fate of the funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to the author Simon.
In the framework of this file, it is also being investigated since Wednesday Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, for misappropriation of funds and complicity, but has been left on parole and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have accused him."
"The magistrate instructor has taken account of the explanations and has left him at liberty," explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night, four other people were questioned and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) property, has been accused of "trafficking influences and passive corruption".
Two Aubagne agglomeration officials, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for “suspension and misappropriation of public goods by a person dedicated to public service” and for “complication in misappropriation of public funds”, respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guerini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for “covering the abuse of social goods.”
Among the people who have faced Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
The researchers suspect that their societies have a service to whitewash the capital of great bandidism.
The investigation is being carried out within the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation points out that the research focuses especially on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the Marseille urban community (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elise has exaggerated Syria mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "spying", has been in the public eye in France, has alerted to diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Eliseo has explained his strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own “rain” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French girl did not take place in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by U.S. justice for material trafficking for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the raw reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played an essential role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is titled "Iran: French Comments on How to Manage Cases of Taking hostages".
Elise's advisor for strategic affairs, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, converse with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrine.
This is explained by the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own detained citizens in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “constantly solve” in the media the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocent,” “immediate liberation.”
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
“When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often.”
Because, once the attempts to negotiate by discreet channels are exhausted, “silence will solve nothing,” the Iranians are “experts in dilatory maneuvers.”
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is “a common Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail.”
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day he will take refuge in the French embassy) “will require the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians” (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>230,000 in reward).
In addition, he notes that the Eliseo anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase".
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after 12 days, but is locked up in Iran.
Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material into Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge’s decision.
The U.S. embassy, like many observers, doubts this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iran’s clandestine procurement networks for the nuclear program, Majid Khakavand’s expropriation is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Freeing Iranians in exchange for French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrine, on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier guarantees that this was not the case.
El Eliseo, he says, has not only “been greatly surprised by the judge’s decision,” but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot annul the decision" judicial, he comments.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is still under the "close" surveillance of French intelligence services.
Eliseo’s advisor dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian “is currently in some buildings in Paris run by the Iranian embassy.”
During Clotilde Reiss’ arrest in Iran, Eliseo does not spare in efforts, uses organized communiqués and “flights” in the media to make Syrian President Bashar al-Assad play an “important” and “influenced” role of “mediator.”
The Americans observe this activity with a certain irony and check that the manipulation brings its fruits, as several press articles broadcast the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions the "media blitz" of French officials.
What is the reason for such “gratitude” towards Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris is being questioned.
“Despite their statements full of praise, French officials privately recognize that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have really done.”
Next, the document discusses the reasons that have led to Eliseus to give rise to this fiction.
The major communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria," he said.
A policy started in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been stamped prematurely and undeservedly."
By “exaggerating Syria’s role,” Paris tries to “show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “seed the seed of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier confided to him: “Of course, we don’t know whether the Syrians have done anything or not.”
"But anyway, we've been grateful."
“At least this should cause confusion among Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in the Eliseo.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for playing an "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot".
Starting at midnight, young Koreans can’t play online
The South Korean government is going to adopt a law called “Cinderella” that will prevent teens from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight to young people under 16 years of age, said representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
“A lot of kids play all night and then it’s hard for them to study at school and lead a normal life during the day.”
“We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, the ministerial responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, precise.
The government is also proposing to ask companies to limit daily access to these games when the parents of young people so request, he added.
In addition, it will make available to anyone who requests it free computer programs that allow to limit the Internet connection time.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the host countries
In the midst of the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political election where the struggles of influence and lobbying can come to a head over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of Belgian and Dutch governments, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests that are at stake.
Rear-end transactions, therefore, may last up to the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidatures have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be too heavy for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption by two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the opportunities of his country, the birthplace of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added wood to the fire on Monday by releasing a documentary that has exposed three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and shame the English officials, who have thrown themselves into intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the head.
The Head of Government hopes to re-edit the successful coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, which had won the JJ.O.O. 2012 organization for London in 2005.
This intense activity, will it be enough to regain England’s brilliance before the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has numerous strong points thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (World 82 in Spain, JJ.OOO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the shady economic and financial prospects of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they get is to give points to Russia, converted into an outsider of weight despite the gaps in their candidacy (stages, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced an "unfair competence in the preparation of the vote", in a direct reference to the British press's accusations against EC members.
"They're pulling their dirty rags out of their way, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems to be the most logical favorites.
As the world’s first economic powerhouse and home to FIFA’s leading sponsors, the country seems to take advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the 2026 World Cup concession to China, fiercely desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of options by 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certain.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be harmed by the weakness of the TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second Commandment: The Test
De Gaulle had indeed doubted.
Mitterrand had made it clear that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less yet.
One mandate in the Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will again be a candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not combine well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear to be doubtful.
On one side and on the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometime in the fall of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that it deals with MPs of the UMP, Tuesday night in the Elise, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused some upheaval.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He just relayed the facts, not an announcement.
It’s not the first time he’s talking about presidents, in a playful tone, at meetings of this kind.
“In the worst, or better, case, you’ll still spend seven and a half years with me,” he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I don't know what's coming next."
His earlier statements do not bring him closer to the candidacy, nor less.
Comments are submitted for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal has gone up to the lecture which leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
Rather, on the contrary; the fact that his 2012 candidacy is evident is what leads many PS people to claim that the battle is organized earlier than expected.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon’s candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy’s (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L’Express).
“We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on the subject,” the Prime Minister’s environment has reacted immediately and prudently.
“If you think you can lose, you won’t be a candidate,” says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
“He’ll always think he can win,” corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: ECB is forced to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The latest meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow to clarify the modalities for the outcome of the crisis or at least announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that should end by the end of the year.
Due to the crisis of European sovereign debt, the Frankfurt Emissions Institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk worsening a situation more than complicated today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde backed the active role played by the ECB in favour of resolving the debt crisis of European states.
He did not mean whether he considered that the central bank should do more, e.g. by increasing its program of purchasing state bonds.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."
On the eve, in Brussels, during its hearing before the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet was not more eloquent about his intentions, indicating only that the State Letters purchase programme was “continuing” during the secondary market and that “we will see it happen.”
The only thing that remains clear is that the ECB will keep its main type unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s acquisition of Treasury bonds has doubled last week to nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.350 million.
In addition, according to the undisclosed market operators, yesterday he would have bought Irish and Portuguese titles again.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have acquired securities worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt at all that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant changes in direction.
Although lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, it still carries out unlimited liquidity allocations under beneficial conditions and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to last for a few months.
"I don't think I'm going to significantly change your schedule."
“If not, it would risk triggering new tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
“It seems more likely that a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 will occur,” Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms, an economist at Sal, said in a statement.
Oppenheim.
In relation to interventions in the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of those liabilities so that the market remains stable,” adds Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
“It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in returns paid by the most fragile states,” said a senior bond manager.
Because, if interest rates are clouded, States will have even more problems reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government capsizes the temporary
After Italy started the week in an alarming way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the 10-year bond rate reflux.
A recovery from precarious calm.
Following a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have said that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as “indecipherable” and that a “unpredictable” weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with the long-term German rates had reached the record figure of 210 basis points and the price of the bankruptcy risk coverage contracts (CRQ) had skyrocketed to 263 points, causing a certain upheaval in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was “deeply concerned” by “market turbulence” and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the euro zone’s third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to cope with its financing needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have meant a glass of cold water for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budget provisions can be applied after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," said Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
At the moment, Italy has the support of the international institutions.
“The foundations of its economy are in order and its accounts are in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
“There is no immediate, short-term or long-term problem, because despite its considerable debt (118.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilisation efforts requested to Italy are smaller than those required to other countries,” said Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans Reflect on Strengthening Mechanisms to Fight the Crisis
Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris: “I think we have already shown Sunday night and day that Europeans are clearly supportive, determined, committed to the defence of their currency and their monetary zone.”
Although relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday in the rates of the obligations of European states has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about a principle of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could lower the rating of Portugal's debt, the most frequent target at the moment of speculation.
“As in May, there is really a lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems,” said economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because “the political pace is much slower than the market pace.”
Aware of this hiatus and of the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying the debates to reinforce the existing mechanisms for exiting the crisis.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers that are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this also taking into account the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, has launched a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first issue of the EFSI securities is expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the countries that are at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are in addition to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path than Greece and Ireland followed.
Both want to avoid asking for international assistance at all costs before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms that they consider necessary to increase confidence in a lasting way.
Finally, the capitalist partners of European funds are presented with the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of public bond markets.
Passing through Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take out the portfolio again.
Barclays Capital economists, a leading player in the European public debt market, believe that an amount of around 100 billion euros extra would be sufficient, “preferably” in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, currently endowed with EUR 60 billion.
A piece of advice that could, without a doubt, examine the European capitals in detail.
Especially if the market conditions are worsening.
Snow and ice: 24 apartments in orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause difficulties in circulation, especially in the secondary network in Brittany, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on the island of France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm, punctually between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Island of France and Lemosin.
Snowfalls are strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been prohibited to vehicles weighing more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axles.
According to the gendarmes, the circulation in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that it is not driven unless necessary and the circulation of certain TER vehicles during the day has been prohibited.
During Thursday, school transport in Picardy has been banned.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture “instructs all drivers to drive with the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation.”
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25 percent of their flights at Paris Roissy Airport on Thursday and 10 percent at Orly due to the expected snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers be contacted with their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: First Financial Drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport on the island of France has reached its peak, billions have been rained.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro that the Société du Grand Paris should build.
To start this SGP, the State has announced a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion funding allocation.
Theoretically, this amount will be the one that will later allow the SGP to obtain loans in the markets to finance a portion of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Financial Corrections Act, reviewed at the National Assembly Finance Commission this morning, contains the devices planned to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: creating a special equipment tax and increasing the office tax on the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in numbers: “The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year”.
The second is a modification of an office tax that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate that increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
There are no figures in the text.
But it's far from 4 billion.
“It is necessary that tax resources be added to the 4 billion euros of the allocation of funds that will mobilize the State and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses,” we can read in the exhibition reasons.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, as explained."
"It will be recorded in the budget and will be used according to needs."
The SGP estimates that it will start receiving $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4 billion promised are not included in the credit, can trigger a slightly lit parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on December 7.
Avengers hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks issue has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems to be a scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and envisions a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's sinisterly ridiculous profile has long been giving cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The norm that secret files should only be made up of news of public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not just in this century.
If you visit a bookshop dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism not only rely on what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown’s success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if it could not be, I know, editor of the Liberation), who only considers certain what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same one that Newsweek published last week.
So why has the revelations of these records caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that the embassies, at least since World War II and since the Heads of State can call or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some limited exercise of representation, have been transformed into centres of pilgrimage.
Any viewer who watches research films knows it perfectly, we just seem to not know it by hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secretive country in the world significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the “convicts”.
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell’s time, he could conceive of himself to all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it now happens, that not even the crypts of the secrets of power can escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, elected as the revenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can you hold on to a power that can no longer keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without a secret, since it comes from the public domain; but it means that the secret is to reveal everything that has been done by Hill.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much more, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the network, since it would be like publishing it in a street sign.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, you can’t expect to keep confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a Head of State has moved on a plane and contacted one of the counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my prediction is a matter of science fiction and therefore novel, but I imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligences with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, by the way, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
That information is then preserved, in a single copy, in locked drawers: after all, the attempt to spy on the Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a wired telegraph (telephone).
The (analog) video tapes had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, advancing and retreating, discovering all the secrets of assembly, while now the (digital) CDs only allow to advance or retreat from chapter to chapter, i.e., at enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the trips it takes, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was secretly going on in the embassies.
Currently, it is the embassies that ask for confidential information to the press.
Climate: France’s caps on its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unblocked financing promises (called fast start or early) made by developed countries have been respected.
And the French hats have been revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.260 million (i.e. 420 million a year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put its best cards on the table to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start funding is true: a report detailing the measures of its member states, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was appreciable and was appreciated for what it really is: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what is meant by “new and additional”.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
At present, each one chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as its reference year: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added in three years in terms of fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references as regards the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 are "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to the expenditure of previous years or to the total level of official development aid.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while it intends to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element, the division between donations and loans.
Again, there are no rules and each one chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that each euro borrowed is equivalent to a donated euro.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more effective technologies), it is necessary to present a euro that is to be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... As a whole, only the cost of the loan should be calculated for its commitments.
But France does not find such reasoning useful: it “respects” its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); consult the EU document to see for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to meet its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast-start financing, France commits a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions over time and, on the other hand, in relation to real financial effort.
Spending just <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million, he manages to give the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional", as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has taken care of the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can just lend?) and in the negotiations, as developing countries are not stupid...
The early funding chapter is a minuscule, relatively short-term, in relation to the overall climate negotiations.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNCITRAL.
Let's hope it doesn't.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could advance the debate on gambling in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter that is currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
Therefore, we have the hope of the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast start and its vision of “additional character” and the use of loans would help improve the level of international confidence needed to advance the negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Genérations Futures (the old movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with", acquired in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that a child of about ten years old usually consumes at four meals and a tent.
These meals taken as a model, which comply with official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day), as well as treats, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five are classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EDs), according to studies from various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
“Although, in virtually all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is worrisome,” the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogens and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicide in France.
The same applies to Kenya’s green Jews, including in food, where the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian fillet, canned tuna and even the bread bar or gum were bonded with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most "nutritive" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the plastic dish analysis used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk that these “contaminants cocktails” generate for the consumer is “probably underestimated,” the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed to "face the gravity of the situation" apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase of diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
