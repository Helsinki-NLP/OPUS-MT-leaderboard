Vikramlander is strongly opposed on the ground. NASA released the photo source.
The Vikram Lander of the 28-moon Yan-2 spacecraft has captured NASA's El Orosi Orbiter film, which is a powerful landing site in the southern part of the Earth's surface.
The moon, launched by ISRO, landed in Vikram Lander on the southern part of the Earth's surface on the 7th of September.
However, in recent times, it has been difficult to communicate with them.
Since the Vikram Lander landed on the ground at a slow pace instead of landing on the ground, it was thought that it might have been damaged and the information communication could have been cut off.
In this situation, NASA's LRC Orbiter crossed the southern part of the ground on the 17th.
At that time, Vikram Lennur landed on the ground and sent a very up-to-date picture of the equilibration area between the two faces of the N and the Mansini C.
It is certain that Vikram Lander was heavily soiled in the ground when he was investigating these pings.
That's why it's so far away from where it's supposed to be.
John Keller, deputy director of NASA's AROC project, said in a statement, "LOROC ORBITER passed the southern part of the island on the 17th.
Then, he sent out the pictures taken during the dark hours of the night.
It has been found that Vikram landed heavily on the land of the lander.
However, Vikram Lander was unable to find the exact location of the landing.
The LROC R Peter will cross the southern part again on the 14th of next month.
As the light will then be good, Vikram Landeri has a lot of chances to like the film."

The Ayodhya Council has decided that the fee will be raised 10 times in all India's industrial technology education institutions as well.
Aayd Education Corporation (AYD) plays an important role in the development of talented students across India, which is known as industrial technology companies.
The meeting of the Union Minister of State for Human Development, Ramesh Bockrial, was chaired by the Union Minister of State for Education, AYD Council, which includes the directors of 23 AYD educational institutions.
The decision to attend the meeting was surprising to both the students and the general public.
The decision has been taken to increase the cost of M.Tech. in Ayodhya companies by 10 times.
In all Ayodhyas in India, only up to Rs 20,000 has been paid to Semester and up to Rs 50,000 has been paid.
At this stage, the fee has now been raised to Rs 2 lakh per annum.
Out of the 12 I.R. students studying in the first year of 2019-2020, 9,280 students are eligible for the grant. M.Tech., the monthly grant amount to be given to the students is also decided to stop at Rs 12,400.
Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Karakpur, Kanpur, Ruri, Gaukathi and Aayid will reduce the funding provided by the central government to the companies.
The central government has raised the cost of charging the money from the students in order to cope with this reduction in funding.
In addition, those companies that have the amount available through construction works that can be done by such industrial technology education companies are advised to carry out development work, purchase a loan in the bank and make a deposit to the corporate companies.
The arrival of the BJP government has prevented the first monks from going to school to the fullest extent possible, the funding for primary education has been reduced in the 2015 financial report, and the funding for education has been reduced in the wake of each financial status report.
As a result of this, the prime ministers continued to give openings to educational institutions in order to make more facilities for private educational institutions.
In this situation, the government has imposed various rules on the way educational institutions should operate in the finances of private companies, without giving any importance to the public institutions in the new education system.
With this in mind, only those who are able to study from basic education to higher education, the central government has re-introduced India's rich future into an unscientific country that has been in the works for centuries.

Ramanujam, the late Kartunist Ranu, was one of the leading painters of Kalichitra.
Ranu Kartoon has created a large number of students through his research and education curriculum.
In general, even those who are celebrated by the world, are not celebrated by the family.
On the contrary, it is one of the proudest things to have come out of the book he has written, after the disappearance of the cartoonist Ranu.
Despite Ron's disappearance, he said that through his works he would continue to live on the path through this book.
While speaking of Kevalampur Shankara Subramaniyam, S. K. Ramanujam, India's leading actor, explained.
He traveled all over the world, and he was trained in the arts.
He described himself as a new artist in the creation of the kaleida.

Prime Minister Edappadi Kulnisami has raised the question of the number of dams built by the ADMK government over the past 8 years.
In a statement released by the party's chief executive Draimurugan in this regard, he has criticised the Prime Minister for not knowing any details about the public sector.
Draimurugan, the DMK businessman, said in his statement that the water that is opened in the caviar, despite the concern of the government of ADMK - the administrative capacity is reduced and lost at sea.
On the way through Kaviri, the DMC Government has no plan to prevent and save it, and our Chairman, M.K. Stall, expressed his concern at the correctness of the responsibility of being the Leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Legislature.
Thinking of answering the question to the Prime Minister, Edappadi Palunichami, who spoke, asked, "Did the DMK Vener, in his government, build any obstructions in the caviri?"
"What I would like to inform him is that we have built a barrier in the Kaviri in the DMK government, in the place of Mayanur.
Without even knowing the details, can Prime Minister Edappadi Palanichami, who is also responsible for public works, speak out against the truth?
With the dam built in Mayanur, the water level of the earth increased in that area.
That's why the farm was destroyed.
So today, the vast majority of the people of the region are benefiting from the fact that there are thousands and thousands of people who have expressed their gratitude to the Government of Kadha at any time.
During that time, a ban was imposed by the government in Mayanur as required.
At that time, there was no need to build any more dams.
If necessary, the artist who was then the Chief Minister would immediately grant permission to it, allocate funds, and sell the work.
Therefore, there is no limit to the government's lack of commitment to the welfare of Kaviri.
I'm wondering, how many of you have been involved in the construction of the DRC in the last eight years?
We have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu during the time of the Tamil Nadu government.
Can you point to a single coin that was built in the late D.M.K. regimes, as a single coin?
Don't lie.
To the charge they have made, if the answer is - let us know with the evidence that we are building the dam at the present places or are planning the structure.
To leave it to the fact that the T.M.K. government has not built a barrier in Kaviri, it may be nice to ask for a personal appointment, to the position of Chief Minister he can be, it is not a civil act, it is not a beautiful, pointed out.

Vikaik Kari went straight today to visit the places of low-level excavations, which reveal the Tamil culture, the Tamil Nadu chief minister M.K. Stall said.
The way in which the literature of the time tells us is that the Tamils who lived in blood and sweat are his life; the results of the following analysis revealed that it is not a renaissance.
The city's civil society began in the 6th century on the north bank of the Ganges River.
But in the 6th century on the south bank of the Waikiki River, the Tamils lived the upper city life; the Tamils lived a very rich life in the knowledge of the best in the literature of the Tamils. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Trump has called for an inquiry into the Ukrainian president.

In this regard, six committees have been set up by the Speaker of the House of Representatives in the Ninci Ortavanbar and an inquiry has been launched into the President's action.
"In this situation, the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Jelensky, spoke to Trump on July 25 by telephone, so conduct the investigation," Trump said in a statement.
Both the presidents of the two countries, the White House has officially released a report on what they said yesterday.
It is, therefore, accepted that what has happened is true.
At the same time, Donald Trump, who spoke to the writers outside of the meeting of the U.N., made this request in a friendly manner.
He said that no pressure was put on the President of Ukraine.
But one thing to keep in mind is that the U.S. government has abruptly halted the nearly $400 million in financial aid to Ukraine.
Then, after a while, the money was allocated.
With this in mind, Mr. Trump's remarks to the president are being finalized by the Democratic Party.
As a result, the incident has begun to wreak havoc on U.S. politics.

In the presence of the Minister of Education, Senkotyan, the issue of impeachable government officials has caused a great deal of controversy.
Minister Senkotyan started drinking water projects at the Dukanayakanpalaya near Gopi in Erode district.
While he was being filmed by reporters at the time, the assistant secretary of the Tamil Nadu Drinking Water Wadgal Board, Muthalingam, was standing in the way of intervening with them.
In the meantime, the media has raised their voices, "Sir, sir, let's stay a while."
Then he said, "Who are you talking about, what are you talking about, what's the big deal you're talking about?"
The minister, who knew he was in Madupota, ordered Senkotyan to get him out of there immediately.
As a result, the high-ranking officials did not want to be at the Muthulinga festival, but immediately demanded that the club be immediately shut down.
However, more than 15 journalists were involved in the road sweepstakes calling for a sector-specific action against the Assistant Secretary-General Muthalingam.
Minister Senkotyan, who was informed of the matter, contacted senior officials of the Tamil Nadu Drinking Water Wadikal Board of the district of Erode, and bought a late-and-midnight report on the courage of the government to come to the party.

With the evidence that is now available, the urbanization of the Waikiki river is carried out in this study.
In the following, it has been decided that the period of Tamil-Prami is more than 100 years old. The study is known to have been written by the Tamil Nadu community in the 6th century BC.
In addition, samples from the 70 <0xCE><0xBC>m tubes released through this study have been sent to the University of Michigan and the University of Texas, a research institute, to conduct a scientific analysis.
In the analysis of these ashtrays, the animals were identified by means of the ashtrays such as Dimilgala, Eruma, Vladhu, Vaduktu, Artiman and Mael.
In the form of vegetables, herbs, and velladas, some types of vegetables such as artichokes, veal, etc. are found in the form of cuttlefish, which is also used to feed these plants.
With the conclusion of this study, those who were primarily involved in the agricultural sector of the Union society also undertook the development of livestock.
Depending on the minerality of the shells, samples of the powders and powders from the blast furnace have been sent to the Vellore University of Technology for analysis.
These are all found in this study in fruits such as silicon, sulfur, iron, aluminum, and mechanic, among others.
In order to protect the lower part of such artifacts, work will be carried out at the main place to be seen by Tamil scholars, students, students and the public in order to be able to use them at an estimated cost of Rs.20 crore.
Further work on the 5th phase of the research will be extended for two weeks and will continue to be carried out.

Is the BJP taking over the politics of the state of Tamil Nadu?
In any case in Tamil Nadu, it is said that in the end, the family politics will be taken into the hands of the BJP, where it is impossible to clean up and keep the tara in the mud.
When Modi was Prime Minister for the first time, he was in a position to see Thamar in Tamil Nadu.
After this, for the second time, i.e. only during the M.P. elections, he said, "I don't know what you're going to do. Tamil Nadu needs to resolve the Tamara Mallarnda," Amitsha said.
However, it was only in the five constituencies that the contest ended.
Even though the entire country is playing catch-up against the BJP, there is a wave of opposition in Tamil Nadu.
It is, above all, the only language in the country, namely, Muthalak, Kashmir, Hindi, and Hindi.
All of this is still in the works, as it is still in the works.
That's why it is said that the BJP leadership is in shambles over the Tamil Nadu BJP executives, which is why even the state leadership is still unattainable.
Whether it is a party or a party, the BJP is planning to dissolve the BJP in Tamil Nadu in any way in the upcoming legislative elections.
For this, it seems that the BJP has come to an almost one-sided conclusion through direct field report and private sector report.
Therefore, whether it be admiral, or admiral, or admiral, the idea that the two Dravidian parties do not give sufficient importance to the people of Nadar and the people of Vaniya and the people of Devendra Kula, the people of that Samadya people.
It is also said that Dravidian parties are saddened by this.
This is the first time that the government has taken this initiative as a BJP candidate.
Whether you have decided to hold a position in the form of pride of that social race, or in the area of giving importance to it.
The appointment of Tamil Nadu Sundirarajan as the Governor of Telangana is also one such.
It is also said that the BJP government attaches importance to the high-ranking people in ISRO.
It is true that if the BJP acts in a way that governs each and every race, it will make the people of that race proud and happy.
And one thing that's not secretive in any way will be secretive to the BJP in this shady politics.
At the same time, while Tamil Nadu is already in shati politics, it is not known whether these activities of the BJP will be like pouring more oil into the burning fire.
It is true that even if the fire was extinguished and the fire started to burn, it would be the same fire that would be burning in Tamil Nadu, which is now a bit rusty!
