The city of Juankoske will join Kuopio in early 2017.
The Kuopio City Council unanimously approved the alliance on Monday.
The City Council of Juankoske approved the association last week.
Tuusniemi municipality was also involved in the investigation of the municipality, but its delegation decided that Tuusniemi would remain independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide to implement the following municipalities separately.
The next municipal elections will be held in 2016.
After the accession of Juankoski, the population of Kuopio is about 111,000.

Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the leadership of Kiev of refusing to engage in direct political discussions with the separatists in eastern Ukraine.
At this point, the leadership of Kiev does not want to conduct a substantive political discussion with the eastern part of its country, Putin said, according to the news agency Itar-Tass.
He also said that Russian-minded separatists, whose Kiev and the West say they are aided by the Russian army, were trying to push Ukrainian troops away from their current places, where Putin said that Ukrainian military forces are shooting civilians.
The goal of the militants is to push these armed forces and their artillery away so that they do not get the chance to shoot the inhabitants of the area, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at Ryrmikorjaamo.
It was a surprise that the crew had come from the very beginning.
Visitors were expected within two days, said promoter Tom Kangas.
The hiphop festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We're still going to be hip-hop festivals, which means pop isn't allowed, Kangas assures.
In Finland, a law will enter into force on Tuesday that restricts the acquisition of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, private individuals will have to apply for a permit from the Police Administration to purchase or maintain possession of substances or mixtures that could be used as a so-called source material for explosives.
Such substances are hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chloride, potassium perchlorate, sodium chloride and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them if the specified concentration values are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide, for example, is present in detergents and detergents, but the concentrations in them usually do not exceed limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, during acceleration.
However, before the entry into force of the law, the source materials may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster Charged With Hotel Violations by Nairn and Pitlochry
The accused of the rapes in two hotels is awaiting trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the allegations at a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
He is charged with the rape that took place at Pitlochry Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman by attacking her “being in an unconscious state, sleeping, and thus unable to make a decision on her own.”
Webster is also charged with another rape at the Golf View Hotel in Upper Nairn on May 4, 2014.
In accordance with the judgment of Judge Lady Rae, the trial will be held on 17 November in Edinburgh at the High Court of Justice.
Election League: Super Raheem shine - Mario stayed in the shadows - Election League - Evening Messages
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered the future hope of English football.
White Hart Lanella had an electronic atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, reinforced by Mario Balotelli, came to visit Tottenham.
The introduction of Super Marion was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working in the field with a very different attitude from Manchester City.
Balotelli was still far from his top line.
The Italian lost three high-quality goals and fed only half of his sixteen innings to his own team.
Pool supporters, who have already become the player’s favourites, expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers placed Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez as the team's second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
As the team’s star, Balotelli was replaced by the centre-field diamond tip Raheem Sterling, who knocked out Hugo Llorisi’s important opening goal of 3-0.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine brightly.
20 centimetres shorter than the balotelli, the Englishman is between the lines of the opponent than the fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who thanks the grass at its best at a speed of about 34 kilometers per hour.
Rodgers also deserves a big thank you for Sterling’s development.
After the match, the Northern Irishman told how Liverpool have systematically developed a more holistic player from a North Londoner who grew up at the roots of Wembley.
Susanna M<0xC3><0xA4>lkki was chosen as the Mayor of Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The City Government of Helsinki has decided to appoint Susanna M<0xC3><0xA4>lki Helsinki as the next super-player conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra from autumn 2016.
The Los Angeles Times has asked what kind of orchestra he will take next.
Susanna M<0xC3><0xA4>lkki says she will begin her new mission with joy and pride.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a key role in our country’s musical life for over a hundred years, for example by presenting a large number of Sibelius music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra before.
I look forward to our future cooperation with enthusiasm,” he says.
Administrations of wage-earners organisations to gather in pension negotiations - Home - Regions - News - Karjalainen
Today, the pension negotiations are seeking a new impetus from the labour market organisations’ own meetings.
The administrations of the SAK, Akava and STTK of wage-earner organisations will deal with the negotiating situation in the morning.
After that, the actual pension negotiations are to be continued.
Among other things, labour market organisations have argued that pensions should be linked to life support.
Organisations have promised a working solution by autumn, but according to the latest estimate, it would occur during this week.
It's a trap.
The Rovaniemi women's volleyball league team Woman Volley met the Vampula Athletes in the final of the Pitiputa training tournament on Sunday.
Vampula turned five into a 3-2 win in a stretched match.
WoVo lost the last game 15-11.
My neighbor was always a step ahead.
The fight was good, but in the defensive game and in the pass game Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo coach Teemu M<0xC3><0xA4>kikyr<0xC3><0xB6>.
WoVo's heel was so brittle that the 190-cent American center Jennifer Keddy was stuck on the side.
It was played by Sara Niemi.
Karoliina Kyll<0xC3><0xB6>nen was a playful woman, and together with Johanna Pekkarinen she formed the most powerful combination of WoVo.
Jenna Keskim<0xC3><0xA4>ki, who started as a hooker, was able to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 games.
The best part of the vamp was the skilled Russian passenger and the libero Hillaelina H<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>l<0xC3><0xA4>inen, which WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo’s preparation will continue next week when H<0xC3><0xA4>meenlinna’s HPK comes to the training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "shop" at 6 pm in the official training game.
On Sundays, we will meet again at the sports school.
Lidl hit by wild numbers in Finland
During the financial year ending in February, the company’s turnover of Finnish stores increased by almost 25 per cent to almost 1.2 billion euros.
The company released its results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and the expansion is planned to continue.
Lidl also said that it paid almost 14 million euros in taxes to Finland in the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more likely to die in less populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and delayed access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released the video in tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers reviewed more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent of women, i.e., more than five years after diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan, from the Berghofer Medical Research Institute, confirmed that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
PIENI TREATMENT: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers went through a seven-year history of women’s health.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, a woman’s age at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, past diseases and socioeconomic status also affected survival.
In older women and cancer, the likelihood of survival at the time of diagnosis spread to a wider extent was lower.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not attempt to find out why women living outside the cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers it a possible cause for delayed diagnosis and delayed access to treatment.
“Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their receptions are mostly located in large cities,” Jordan says.
Although the treatments performed as distance services are becoming more common and the importance of distance is decreasing, in addition to them, the researcher suggests increasing the mobility of doctors, so that specialist doctors can treat patients closer to these homes, as well as programs that will help the patient to be supported remotely at home.
According to Dr. Jordan’s research, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of geographical location, which underlines the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
A study funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer charity will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, 33-year-old Gold Coast family member Elisha Neave was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen its position-based skate park activity in the Friendship Park, which is located next to the hotel in Pohjanhov.
On Monday, the City Government decided that the proposal for the position of the Friendship Park and its immediate surroundings would be placed at a public service point in Osviitta.
The draft proposal calls for opinions from the Environment Board and the Lapland Ely Centre.
With the help of the change of station, the city wants to allow the continuation of the motorcycling activities related to tourism in the region.
The purpose of the site is to form a park area that includes the area between the current Friendship Park and it and the river.
According to the proposal, the site will receive a permanent maximum of 200 motorcycles between 15 November and 30 April.
There may also be gaskets for the designated part of the area.
The new park area is also allowed for maintenance traffic.
The city of Rovaniemi has rented the area of Friendship Park to safari companies for motorcycling in the winter.
The lease has been renewed for the last spring of 2014 and the lease is valid until spring 2018.
Kelkkaparking and the change in the formula has also raised opposition to loud noises.
The inhabitants of the neighbouring buildings have been worried about both the noise and the emissions.
However, the area's emissions have been investigated and no findings beyond the reference values have been found in the studies.
Renewed equipment is also older than low-emissions.
As a parking lot, it is also supported by the fact that if the starting point were to be moved further, the hotel’s safari customers should transport safaris to the starting points by buses, which would be estimated at 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area of the Friendship Park and the surrounding area is also wide enough for the sledgehammers, better than places of origin, such as the east bank of the Ounasjoki bridges.
The Friendship Park is good for its location because in the future operations can expand, for example, to the Ounaspaviljong region.
The establishment of parking activities is part of the urban strategy approved by the Rovaniemi City Council, which aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business activities by booking high-quality areas in logistically and functionally favorable places.
The park has also been marked as the starting point for motorcycling in the centre’s public square, which has not yet received legal force.
The decrease of the ownership properties is visible in the garden shops
A decrease in the number of homeowners, especially in a group of under 35 years of age, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of garden shops by tens of millions, when today’s young consumers reach the “main target of gardening” for their age.
According to the Financial Times, homeowners spend only 55 percent of their homeowners’ money on gardening.
The study also revealed that more and more people live in very urbanized apartments that do not have gardens. In addition, the size of the garden decreases when the front yard is covered more and more in the parking lot. Also, these factors threaten the garden area, with an estimated value of 5 miles.
In the Greater London area, housing ownership has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, and there is the least amount of money spent on garden products per household across the country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Association of Gardeners (RHS), increasing the rent of apartments or decreasing the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS’s senior gardener, says that “plants grown in, for example, transferable growing plants are particularly popular among tenants, as such growing plants can be included in the change if necessary.”
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were a period of boom in the resale of the garden sector, as ownership and wealth increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will focus this year due to better weather conditions, with the weather in March and April of last year being worse.
Turkey Admits U.S. Diplomat for Spying Report
Turkey’s foreign ministry has called on the country’s most experienced U.S. diplomat to give an account of a report on U.S. and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulentin said the U.S. Embassy’s official and Turkish authorities had discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and the website The Intercept have written that the documents leaked by former US National Security Agency (NSA) analyst Edward Snowden reveal that Turkey was on the U.S. and UK roads.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan debunked the significance of the report by saying that all major states have been spying on each other.
A previous report on the spying of the German intelligence service in Ankara led to a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.

Majorcan Magaluf police chief accused of corruption
Those who reported the incident presented evidence of the crackdown by police and officials of the city government of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> in the Office of the Prosecutor General of Majorca on Friday.
The police chief of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0>, located on the island of Majorca, has been arrested as a result of corruption charges filed by the Magaluf area’s owners and bartenders, known for the wet celebration.
José Antonio Navarro was placed under investigation after several Punta Ballena street operators filed corruption charges against him. Most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs are located on Punta Ballena Street.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the witnesses of the case presented evidence of the crackdown by police and officials of the city government of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> on Friday at the prosecutor’s office against corruption in Mallorca.
The Spanish national map detained two other local police officers in connection with corruption allegations, and they are indicted by the judge along with Navarro.
ABC, a nationwide daily newspaper, wrote about the partisanship of angry night club owners, which significantly hampered their business operations.
“It’s not about money anymore, it’s about survival,” a businessman told the court.
You're not destroying our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in several countries headlines this summer when a YouTube video was broadcast online, in which an 18-year-old British vacationer engaged in mouth-to-mouth with 24 men during a so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island’s authorities have sought to curb the drunken and uncontrollable use of Magaluf’s holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in notorious alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse core, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the nightclub owner and pub crawler Carnage were ordered to jointly pay a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000.
Above all, the popular Magaluf tourist destination among young British tourists has also become popular with the so-called balconing trend, which has caused several accidents due to alcohol use, when people have jumped from the balcony to the other or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and shells bombed their communities in the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and schools remained closed during the fighting.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in the rocket-bombed communities of southern Israel, but traces of fighting are still visible.
In the southern city of Ashdod, workers removed traces of debris from the walls and slides before the children arrived at the rocket’s battered day home.
“We’re a little scared but also excited,” says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz, Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at a city school.
Many children living in this area are in dire need of routines.
According to Shani Bart, Bart’s 11-year-old daughter, returning to school for a long time feels “a little strange.”
“We’ve had some tough times when we didn’t leave home,” he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Prior to the start of last week’s fire, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad had either stayed indoors or left their homes in safer areas away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many residents of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza Strip are suspicious of returning to the community of a 4-year-old Palestinian boy who was killed by a shell.
According to the Ministry of Education, a fair number of ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, near the Gaza Strip, which was the target of a heavy Palestinian invasion.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "children's education and safety will be taken care of".
Israel and Hamas agreed on a ceasefire so far last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the fighting, but it did not provide a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas’ demand for the removal of the Israeli-Egyptian divide and the reopening of Gaza’s air and sea routes.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and return the body of two Israeli soldiers who fell in the war.
In Egypt, a new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has differed in the number of dead, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it did not have adequate evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers shot down 4,591 rockets and shells in Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
In turn, the Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 free throws and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to its protection of more than 100 UNs to maintain a school that had been converted into temporary protections.
While tens of thousands of people were still in Finland and the fighting continued, the school authorities moved the start of the school the previous week.
“I hope that the school will open soon and we will get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old school in Gaza City.
According to the commonly used meter, housing prices have risen to a maximum of seven years in the Australian winter months.
The price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic homes in Australia’s capital city rose by 1.1 per cent in August, according to RP’s data on Monday.
As a result of the increase in prices during the summer, July and August, the total increase was 4.2 per cent, which is more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen evenly across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, research director at RP Data, Sydney and Melbourne are at the forefront of rising prices.
The results of RP Data show that housing prices rose 16.1% in Sydney and 11.7% in Melbourne in the previous year.
The housing markets of Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are the next most vibrant; the average price increase is five to six per cent.
The weakest housing markets are in Canberra, where prices rose by just 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring started in Australia to increase the number of homes on sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
“Given the increase in sales of auctioned homes, generally a strong sales pitch and a continued low interest rate, it is likely that housing prices will continue to rise over the next three months,” Lawless says.
The new G<0xC3><0xB6>sta museum has attracted record-breaking crowds in M<0xC3><0xA4>ntt<0xC3><0xA4>
The new museum and visual art have attracted record-breaking audiences this summer in M<0xC3><0xA4>ntt<0xC3><0xA4>.
The Serlachius Museum of Art has visited more than 70,000 visitors by the end of August.
The new G<0xC3><0xB6>sta Museum opened in June and has featured classic works of pop art by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, among others.
M<0xC3><0xA4>ntt<0xC3><0xA4>’s week of art again reported on Monday that he had made a visitor record, when 14,500 interested people had visited the Momenten event this summer.
These numbers are not used.
People have been knocked out of doors and windows,” says director Pauli Sivonen from the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to the Serlachius museums this year will be closer to a hundred thousand.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
The M<0xC3><0xA4>ntt<0xC3><0xA4>-Vilppula, located between Tampere and Jyv<0xC3><0xA4>skyl<0xC3><0xA4>, has about 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum director Sivonen reminds us that new museums are always open when events occur.
“The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent,” he says.
We hope that the art season will continue over the long summer.
In autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
Police have been investigating a robbery in Kajaan over the past four days.
On Sunday evening, business properties in North Lancashire were broken down by breaking a window.
The author had received a small amount of money from the cash machine.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel was stolen from the truck’s fuel tank.
From the port of Pet<0xC3><0xA4>isennik, the ship was again carried out on Sundays and Mondays with its main engines.
The sailboat was light and swirling from the inside.
The inside cover reads the text "OIVA".
A couple of suspects have already been caught by the police.
On Sunday evening, the business premises at Tikkapuronti were broken.
The police dog got a trace and a couple of dozen homeless men were found hiding in the woods under six.
On Monday, police arrested another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected of being guilty of the same crime.
Missing Amphetamine Caused Murder in Kajaan
The disappearance of ten grams of amphetamines led to the murder of a Kajani man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to the apartment with his partner and another man and shot the suspect, a 34-year-old Kajaani woman, at the mine as a drug dealer.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that another man was involved in the shooting.
The incident came to the attention of police when a police party stopped a passenger car in which the gang was burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to the burned clothes, a broken funnel was found in the car.
The right of appeal in this case shall be given a judgment at a later date.
August was very hot in many places.
According to the Institute of Meteorology, the same hot August repeats on average once every ten years.
Statistics from the Institute of Meteorology show that the average temperature was higher than normal throughout the country.
In most parts of the country the deviation was from one to two degrees.
Due to the July and August heatwaves, the whole summer was warmer than usual.
Throughout the summer, the highest temperature was measured in the first week of August in Por, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says my father never wanted me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born to a seven-year-old Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, Midlands, England, in 1958.
Henry's father worked at a factory and died when Henry was 19 years old, and his son's relationship with his father was distant.
Henry is currently practicing for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and developed on the basis of the Radio 4 channel series.
Soundtracks are a mix of reggae and rap in upbeat.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy many times since his mother’s death, and he thinks a lot about his relationship with his father.
My father was very difficult to read.
His face was never seen, only his voice said, "Stop the shaking."
Leave your sister alone.
Go, go!
I'm watching cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the shape of a beer mug or the beauty of cricketing.
I've never spoken to him about such things.
For the most part of my life, he was the smiling man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal mill in Dudley and thus got an idea of what his father’s life had to be like, even though working conditions are better today than they were then.
Today, the glares are slightly brighter, but they are practically dark, smokey, labyrinth-like depths, where flames, smoke and slurries burst and bring to mind the shade.
Dad used to go to the bathroom and just the ground in the shower, and quietly began to sing to himself, washing the dirt of the wet house away from himself.
As I walked around, I realized that he had been doing the work for years to get us food at the table, and I started to appreciate him more.
Despite this, Henry’s childhood lacked the closeness provided by his parents.
My father never wanted to and never said he loved me.
Only when my mother began to get sick a little before her death did we begin to love each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through her own child she has been able to share the love she herself lacked as a child.
Do you have to repeat “I love you” all the time?
Stop that shit! Stop it!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry is still a good friend of French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to my mother’s death.
When I started suffering from a lot of overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full translation.
After that I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a strict diet to reduce the symptoms.
It is very difficult –
and boring.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's famous, short beard perhaps depicts his change during career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is immersed in the making of the theatre.
Next up were the comedy The Promises and August Wilson's Fences ("Aidat").
Making the theatre offers a different experience than sitcoms and comedies that Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started the business when he was just a 16-year-old factory worker.
A squeaky-eyed man noticed him doing imitations on stage and contacted the New Faces Skill Competition.
Henry's television career began in the mid-1970s. "How long have I been the only black impersonator and comedian on television," he says.
Henry learns to do his job.
I had to grow up in a public lighthouse, I had to learn to make jokes about the slider between 1975 and 1985, while I was on TV, and it was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people appeared in black-and-white costumes, so Henry ended up as a comedian for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and insulting, I was able to work on huge events and learn how to deal with the audience.
Yet "British TV's award-winning, multi-year favorite and light entertainment program" was at the same time a "smooth parody of black people".
Henry worked in the 80s on a second comedy series, in which both black British culture was ridiculed and admired.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry was known as the character of chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
For the next decade, Henry spent a couple of commercials, documentaries, TV shows, and movies, but after his 2008 BBC series, LennyHenry.tv, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len?"
Next up was the Radio 4 documentary series "What's So Great About...?".
The first part is about Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't really taught to us in school properly, and I think it belonged to a white middle class who wears pantyhose and has money.
That's why Shakespeare's theme aroused fear in me.
All the people we interviewed on the show — Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench — told me, “Try.
Don’t give up until you know what you’re talking about.
Meet the words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 verses from Othello's last speech for the document and he had been sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It felt almost as if some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
“This is about it, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your bags, do a little background research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play months before it was done.
In the end, the show was a success.
It was expected to fail, but it didn’t happen at all.
Soon after, Henry played the lead role in the Comedy of the Damned.
All of a sudden I played in the British National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, “Oh, you’ve changed.”
Once in the play there were technical problems, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
“The little voice in my mind said to me, ‘You have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.’ ”
Instead, the director's assistant indicated that the proposal would be continued as soon as the problem was fixed.
I walked out of the stage, and part of me was relieved.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to others to take care of.

Henry "Fences" at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the words in the play "Fences" was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more sustainable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods: "This is what you have to do."
Of course, this is what Henry says in a funny voice.
So I decided to stay here.
I sincerely love this work.
I love the training rooms.
Henry, however, is still basically a comic: the little boys with a sense of humor interrupt our conversation constantly as he switches from one imitation to another.
Stopping the stand-up comic is a matter of will, as getting an immediate thank you from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you're thirsty all the time, it can lead to death.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theater when I feel like it, but generally speaking, it no longer excites me the same way it used to.
I'm asking Henry if he wants to go on another stand-up tour.
It’s a real pleasure for me to sit with the director, who helps me edit the beginning, middle and end of the whole trip, and I don’t think I ever want to give up that feeling.
Is this his new birth?
I think so.
I like to play –
It's really fun.
The show is constantly telling a story, and I am having fun doing it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya Creates Register of Officials to Remove ‘Morning Workers’
Kenya has begun to draw up a biometric registry of officials as it attempts to remove “morning workers” from government payrolls.
Employees who did not register for the next two weeks would no longer be paid, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid wages after they leave their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to curb public sector corruption after taking office in 2013.
According to the audit carried out earlier this year, at least one million dollars per month was spent on wages and other economic abuses of "morning workers".
The government suspects that salaries will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left his official job, BBC’s Wanyama Chebusiri reports from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must report themselves to the registry in the following weeks at the identification centres in order to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric registration form, the government said in a statement.
According to the report, anyone who fails to do so without proper reason will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure makes a significant sense of the public sector, because it defines how many people actually work in their duties. In addition, it cleans payrolls at both levels of government. This solves the problem of "hap workers", says Minister of Housing Waiguru and the Minister of Public Health, of the District of Waiguru.
The result of the 2015 financial year for the Sein<0xC3><0xA4>joki river may be EUR 25.5 million in deficit unless the city adjusts to its activities and expenditure development in a tense economic situation.
Based on the current budget preparation, the annual budget is about 9.4 million short-term.
The most effective means were to increase the scope and level of services, purchase of services, sale of property and subsidies, as well as increase in tax and payment revenues.
The total investment target of EUR 10 million is EUR 8.5 million.
No relief is allowed for the situation of the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, the insufficient growth in tax revenues, the increase in unemployment and the 5% cut in government shares further weaken the outlook.
The aim of the Economic Seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The City Council agrees that the savings must be made.
The ship has to be translated into a strategy-based goal, says Mayor Kimmo Heinonen, President of the City Government.
The City Government returned the proposals that had been made to prepare the management team.
The proposals of the City Government are the basis of the budgetary statement at the Committee's Financial Seminar in Fram on Monday, 8 September.
After the delegation seminar, the budget proposal proceeds to the city government and the city council through board-handling.
Dozens of Turkish Police Arrested as Suspects of ‘Drinking’ Government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "against the government", local media sources say.
The police did not immediately comment.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, among those arrested were 14 high-ranking police officers.
Some of the police officers were involved in last December's corruption investigations, which targeted government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organizing a wide-ranging crime syndicate and tracking phones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as prime minister at the time) said police actions were part of Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen's planned action against him and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told reporters that all schools had not reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September ceremonies were not held in every school.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
All of Ukraine, all of the huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksa Pastukhov, who serves as a leading teacher at the Slavic school, where Yatsenyuk’s daughter attends, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children can get a lesson that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school traditionally include children’s written shirts, balloons and the giving of flowers to teachers.
According to Perry of Texas, tweeting was illegal.
Texas Governor Rick Perry’s confirmed Twitter account sent a chilling picture Sunday night of the Democrats’ time on the border while hearing accusations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
The tweet was sent illegally from my account.
"I do not accept the tweet and I have deleted it," the later publication said.
Perry's background teams did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry’s confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who posted the picture.
The first tweet included Travis’s captivating crime thriller about Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry stopped funding Lehmberg's office when he refused to resign, which led to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month accused Perry of being a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The title of the tweet was: "I don't always drink, three times allowed on larger prom dresses... But when that happens, I blame Governor Perrya for pointing my finger at me."
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office did not conduct a large jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antonio, who was assigned by a Republican judge.
Perry has said he is innocent and has called the charges a political conspiracy.
His influential legal team has asked the judge to dismiss the charges and said that the law on the basis of which the governor who was the longest in office in Texas is accused is unclear, mirrored by the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state aid to the government's non-infringement unit, which operates in Travis County and faces public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision led a left-wing monitoring group to make a formal complaint.
Perry’s confirmed Twitter account is updated regularly – and sometimes famously.
Entering fifth place at Iowan’s 2012 presidential election campaign, Perry threatened to end his campaign by posting a picture of himself on Twitter while driving at the lake with the text “Here we go, South Carolina!”
According to Berkeley, the housing market is “normal” again.
One of London's most important builders has warned that the housing market in South East England has "returned" to a normal level of activity.
The capital city of London’s housing has been hampered by huge demand and sharp price increases while fearing a widespread credit bubble, prompting the Bank of England to impose restrictions on housing loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and chairman of high-level builder Berkeley, said on Monday that "from the beginning of the coming fiscal year, the market and volume of trades have returned to normal after the 2013 spike" and added that this has enabled "a stable operating environment".
During the recession, London’s housing market went well when foreign investors tried to flee to the capital.
According to the data provided by the Land Register, the prices of apartments in the city rose by 18.5% just in the previous year, thus clearly exceeding the average value of England and Wales, which was 6.7%.
Average sales prices for private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose about the fifth year in the previous year, reaching a price increase of <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London real estate less attractive in recent months - some of which have also been affected by new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "map tax" before the general elections in May.
London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April housing loan report, which reported tighter lending orders, would lead to a lower level of market growth in both property sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
The Bank of England’s recent data showed on Monday that the number of loans approved fell in July, citing a chilling housing market.
The real estate broker Hamptons International has calculated the 2015 forecast for London real estate prices, according to which prices are down by three per cent because the index measuring prices from the opinion of homeowners has already started to weaken.
The number of trades made in London’s most expensive areas in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped in the fourth quarter of last year, says real estate broker WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, which increased revenue from properties sold to over <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that “the demand for a well-designed, right product in the right places has remained stable, and therefore sales have remained active.”
In June, the company reported that it sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, almost a third more than at the peak of the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits rose by 40 per cent year-on-year, resulting in <0xC2><0xA3>380 million and net sales increased by 18 per cent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
Pidgley said on Monday before the company’s annual meeting that Berkeley’s earnings of the year correspond to the current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the profit before taxes for the whole year is <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
In the afternoon, Berkeley’s share on the London Stock Exchange sold at an even price of <0xC2><0xA3>23.96.
Hackers leaked Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards Distributive Event.
A hacker who claims to hold a hundred other stars’ photos, Oscar-winning actor Jennifer Lawrence has leaked them online.
A star-studded star confirmed the images were genuine and condemned the hacker’s “slow violation of privacy.”
The Estonians have been contacted, and all those who publish Jennifer Lawrence's stolen images will be charged.
The photos, originally published on the 4chan Screenshots page, had apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple’s iCloud storage system. One hundred other hackers are alleged to be on the list of dozens of other female stars, including ElizabethKan, Karstian, and Mary.
It is not known how much of the images are real, however, Scott Pilgrim vs. World star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
“To those who look at the pictures taken years ago in the privacy of my home, I hope you have a good mind,” Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of the Nickoladeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "these so-called nude pictures of me are AMAZING, you don't understand."
Let me make the end of this right from the beginning.
BuzzFeed announced late on Sunday that a representative of pop star Ariana Grande had denied the authenticity of the images about the stars.
Only we have an obvious take on the new novel from Howard Jacobson’s thanks, which tells of love and the letter j
They were dissolving, it was the best picture of what happened, gradually separating from each other like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only then did he hear from the woman that she was too serious, difficult, intense, detached, and perhaps also a little short.
That's when he waved his hand.
He recognized his dick.
Yes, he was as sharp as an ass.
The last victim of his spikes was a relationship at first, which had, however, been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it might have even brought some content into his life.
Solomon’s family had unstoppable hair, and he had a delicately pleasing beauty with a cheerful heart, from the northern village, which was even harsher and further away from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come to the south with a traveling companion, Kevern, who was supposed to be his aunt. Her aunt had inherited a house that was located in a wet but paradisiacal valley, and the name of the valley was suitably Paradisiacal Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, all the bathrooms had straw hats, the etanates had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place their own, the garden grew rich trees that resembled giant weightheads.
The house was like a children's garden, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is set to receive the Booker Literary Award in 2014.
Nominations will be published next week
Kevern had sat in the palm of his hand with Ailinn, with broken terrace chairs in the middle of a long haystack, enjoying the surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening intently to the reception, through which the whole country heard soothing music and soothing haystacks of the haystack, the haystacks of the haystack, the haystacks of the haystack, the haystacks of the haystacks, the haystacks, the haystacks,
Your legs are too big.
Such songs were, in principle, too aggressive, and were no longer played in the receiver.
They weren’t banned – nothing was actually banned – they just weren’t played anymore.
They wanted to be forgotten, as the word itself was forgotten.
General opinion achieved what was not achieved by law and proclamation: just as in the field of literature, people chose to read heroes' memoirs, cookbooks and romances, in terms of music, they favored ballads.
As the day wore on, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano with the keys and sing serenads to Ailinn’s big feet with a squeaky, squeaky voice.
My parents didn't understand.
"It was the famous song of the jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and at the same time naturally raised two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was what his father had always done before the letter "J" got a scratch on his lips.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father said he played the same game with his father.
If you let go of the word beginning with j, and you didn't remember to raise two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn’t a fun game at the time and it wasn’t.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
My parents had never heard of it.
Jazzia wasn’t really banned, it wasn’t just played.
The improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only one word for life.
At the beginning of the song, people wanted to know exactly where it would end up.
The same thing had happened to the old man.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the subtlety presented through music.
Although Kevern had not heard of Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's seminal CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell my parents that Fats Waller was black.
Given the age of Ailinn, it was likely that he did not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
There is no need for laws or coercion here.
Hearing society meant that each part of it was grateful — grateful — for the fact that they were fortunately spared the trade — of the principle that each group did things that were natural to it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, the Afro-Caribbean family members are best suited to entertain and sport, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the mainland of India, the people were naturally gifted with electrical appliances, so their task was to ensure that each family had a functioning phone that was used to handle things.
Those who were left from the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke the boards.
And when they had eaten the fat, and had drunk the blood of the bullock, and had drunk the blood of the bullock, and the blood of the lambs, and the fatlings, and the fatlings, and the lambs, and the fatlings, and the lambs, and the fatlings, and the lambs,
Every man according to his gifts.
My parents had only heard the ballads, and she was hard to understand how Kevernern’s hurtful words to sing had ever been able to dress up as music.
Through music, love was expressed.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for the big boys.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the sound of the huge scales of the leaves.
My parents still didn’t understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to lift two fingers to his lips with Ailinn.
My parents had to help her right now.
“I think it was fun,” he said.
The family put their head in disbelief, and his hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
There is nothing else to see in the whole world but the huge, rusty hairdo of Ailinnin.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you say so once," he said, but didn't sound convinced.
It doesn’t explain why you sing it to me.
My family seemed to be really confused.
Are my feet so big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your elbow, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my nipples are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you", but it was too early for that.
"You're attractive to me because of your thick ankles," he tried to correct the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This was no help.
He wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the persuasive charm with which the cruelty of jokes can be controlled.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
The family of Solomons blushed and rose from their terrace chairs and, at the same time, knocked down the receiver and poured the wine they had just been drinking.
The wine was made only from saffron, so it could not be used as a cause of the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake like the leaves of a palm tree in a storm.
"And your fat head is what's irritatingly attracted me to you," he said...
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern was sorry for Ailin, both for his own unnecessary cruel words and for the fear he saw in his eyes at the moment when Ailin decided to stand up against him.
Did your father think he'd kill you?
He had never told Kevern about life on a cool northern island where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure it was basically the same as life here.
The same huge, beautiful sea that waved against them.
The same mixed men, however, even more bitter and treacherous than their smuggler and distributor parents, walked from the pub to the pub, ready to beat every woman who dared to resist or tease them.
Fat head?
He'd still see a thick box if he wasn't careful!
Suck first – kissing had become the most common word to describe a man’s and a woman’s erotic encounter; the antidote to the meaningless love ballads pumping out of the receiver – suck first and then attack.
Keverner thought that was too much, because the absorption itself was hostile.
Solomon’s father’s body language urged him to leave.
He pulled himself up from the terrace chair like an old man.
Her parents also felt exhausted, but the depth of Keverner’s grief surprised her.
This was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
The family followed him on his way—just as his traveling companion watched Kevern walk out the upstairs window—to a man who himself was the cause of his heavy life.
When Adam left the garden, he thought.
He felt sorry for Kever and the men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
He turned his back, a humiliating, shameful, beaten man who had lost all will to fight – why did he feel that sight was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he had ever seen such things before?
When Solomon’s family was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the just described event, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private facility measuring General Mindfulness in Ofnow, made a short study of the continuation of small and medium-sized violence in the country’s poorest areas, in what
"There is already a lot to be accomplished, and much is yet to be done," he wrote, "to level up the natural aggression of the people who have fought for thousands of years, and who have won most of the time, especially in those abandoned and remote coves, where there are hordes of people who are scattered over the vast expanses of the bush.
However, some things cannot be completely eliminated.
The higher the tower, the lower the wills it gives rise to.
The nation weeps over sentimental ballads, ahmi stories telling stories of defeated conflicts, and swears in the name of the good of marriage and family life, but at the same time the old-fashioned cruelty keeps indelible in its grip both the rural communities and the urban districts, and in addition, in the streets of the village, and in the streets of the village,
“You have a regrettable tendency to dramatize,” his director commented after reading the entire report.
I would suggest that you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered his gaze to the ground.
Also, I have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to assert its right not to answer personal questions.
Feminists?
Once again, silence.
“I don’t ask,” Luther Rabinowitz said, “because I oppose atheism, lesbianism and feminism.
There are no pre-conceptions in this workplace.
We are the servants of an unprejudiced society.
While a certain kind of hypersensitivity is fully acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted results, such as you have just presented to me.
You obviously have something against the church – and what you call cruelty or evil-souledness, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
SHOPPING HERE IS WHAT WE WON, IF WE WON, as if it had happened yesterday, if it had happened at all, will destroy the earth’s basic life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around him as he spoke to Rabinowitz.
Behind Rabinowitz’s head, the flaming pink LED light announced a direction that Ofnow had already distributed to the country in the quarter of the last century or so.
Smile at your neighbor, value your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, disagree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, and the sung word is better than written, but nothing wins love.
"I understand very well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum answered in a quiet voice, when he was sure that his conductor had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find that we will repeat the same mistakes that originally led to HIM, WHAT WE WON, IF WE WIN.
This time, however, we do not waste our hatred and distrust of others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience. . .
"You're going too far," he said, "in describing 'wrong' the actions our grandparents might have done or not done.
You also go too far when you say that they poured out 'their hatred and distrust on others'."
You shouldn’t have to remind yourself that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we’re not talking about ‘we’ or ‘them’.
There was no ‘us’ or ‘others’.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
“If we are completely honest, in that chaos,” Esme dared to continue, “no group in society can say that they behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done, done, was either good or bad.
It was then.
We don’t need to talk about it anymore – we agree.
And just as it is unnecessary to share accusations, there is also no need to make corrections, whether they were appropriate or not, and even if there is some way to make them.
But for what purpose does the past then exist if it is not taken as a lesson --
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said, and expressed that Esmen had time to leave.
The next day, when he went to work in the normal way, he was hit by a motorcyclist who was driving on a pedestrian street, whom passers-by described as "evil and angry".
Accidents happen.
Lesotho’s army refuses to plan a strike; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho’s military officials have denied that they were carrying out an attack aimed at overthrowing the government and said they were acting against police who were suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maserus.
The head of state traveled with his family to a neighbouring country in South Africa after he was told that he had received a death penalty.
Army representative Major Ntlele Ntoi denied the attack and said that the army responded to such a threat, which came from "political fanatics". The police have been said to have attempted to arm the fanatics.
“Lesotho’s defence forces took action after receiving a number of intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics when they are ready to cause problems,” he told the Voice of America news agency.
South African Prime Minister Clayson Monyela said the military's actions appeared to be a revolutionary undertaking.
“While no one has claimed to have abandoned their government by force, the actions of Lesotho’s defence forces show the hallmarks of a similar revolutionary enterprise on every side,” he said.
According to Lesotho army officials, the soldiers return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital had a peaceful atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing is running the government while Thabane is away.
Thabane says he believes he is the target of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended the parliamentary session due to disagreements between the large coalition government.
He thus denies the power of the government, even if it is claimed otherwise.
Trade Sheet: Microsoft Sets Up a Data Center for New Zealand
Microsoft has set up a large data center for New Zealand, the location of which the company does not agree to specify.
In a statement to Microsoft’s media, the company said it would not disclose the location of all of its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It's an investment for Microsoft of hundreds of millions of dollars.
In public, Oulu or Kajaania had previously been occupied as the centre.
Microsoft is shutting down its Oulu office, taking jobs from around 500 people.
In total, Microsoft has announced its resignation in Finland with a maximum of 1,050 jobs.
Camilla Lindfors, Microsoft’s communications director, told STT that the company did not comment on how many staff the new data center employs.
The establishment of the Data Centre was reported to Uudellemaa on Monday.
A man accused of overtaking a girl in a traffic accident
A 78-year-old man has been charged with driving a three-year-old girl in a traffic accident in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of driving on a girl at a crossroads in Pittenween in eastern Neuk.
According to prosecutors, Stewart drove his Audi Q3 car carelessly and caused the girl injuries.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charges at Dundee's sheriff's hearing.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four Tips for Better Underwater Images and Videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have several different device options to choose from.
The cheapest option is a water-resistant, compact point-and-shoot camera such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost around $300.
I myself took these pictures at a family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that you should follow.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, still make sure that the camera battery and other parts are closed waterproof.
In addition, set the camera's settings to match the photos or video you take.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and video camera have a setting that allows you to optimize the picture conditions underwater.
Also – before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can take.
Some cameras last only 5 feet deep, others up to 50-60 feet deep.
Learn about both conventional and waterproof models in our shopping guide and in the reviews of digital cameras.
Take several pictures – many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that lets you zoom in, while action cameras often don’t have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see underwater, and image blurring can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
In addition, if your camera allows you to zoom in, which means taking multiple images at the same time with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light goes down much deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface while photographing the pool, lake or sea.
This way, you will also get more colors in your pictures; the deeper you go, the less colors will appear.
Try to get close to the object to be described.
This is important advice when describing land, but even more important under water, because the light conditions are thin.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, i.e. the photographer must be close to the object in order for the object to fill the whole picture with frames.
China won’t let Hong Kong choose its leader – protesters vow revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament ruled that Hong Kong voters should not elect candidates for the 2017 election despite the growing, democratic reform that calls for peace.
The decision is likely to spark the long-awaited protests of Hong Kong’s business district after activists begin to plan and implement the demonstrations only hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the People's Congress of China to give the Communists the power to rule out all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
“This was expected, but it’s still irritating,” said Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They lied to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are working with an independent government.
Li Fei, deputy secretary of the Chinese People’s Congress committee, defended the Chinese government by saying that the general nomination of the Hong Kong leader in the election would be too “chaotic”.
Since 1997, in handing over Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised residents in the region that it will be allowed to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to the Chinese leaders, the decision on Sunday was a democratic breakthrough, because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to control the electoral process closely through the Beijing-administered Nomination Committee.
According to the new sentence, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" are accepted.
In the summer leading up to the decision, some of the biggest and most attention-grabbing protests in the region were held in Hong Kong for years.
Behind the campaign to defend democracy was largely the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the operation of the business card if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central movement gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong's headquarters.
In the demonstration, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement would move into a new era of civil unrest, and they would trigger protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not disclose the details apparently fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a statement released online, the organisers said the movement “holds Occupy Central as a last resort that will only be implemented if there is no hope for dialogue and there is no other way.”
We are very sorry to announce that today the last opportunity for dialogue has collapsed and the conquest of the centre will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest is fueled by the feeling that residents are quietly losing control of their cities.
The wave of people arriving from the mainland has caused competition for products and services.
In addition, there is a fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are disappearing under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its sentiments threaten Hong Kong’s vitality – the business world.
“The protest they’re talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it lasts,” says lawmaker Regina Ip, who has long criticized the move.
We do not want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is slipping away from us.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
The Chinese state media has also told stories that Hong Kong’s democratic activists are the hostages of the Western powers that are waging the revolution.”
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights, attended by 780,000 people – more than one-fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the region’s largest democratic demonstrations.
U.S. prom tradition hits UK universities: private jets for new students
We are excited to respond to the demand by establishing the UK’s first luxury travel format for today’s students.
In addition to the private jet, the company also offers other vehicles, such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most memorable arrival at the university.
According to Stewart, there is also a security aspect to the service.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise rob their property across the country in loaded cars.
When this is combined with many VIP features (VIP friends), we are ready to provide today’s students with the easiest and highest-quality transportation to the university.
According to the company’s representative, reservations have not yet come, as the service has just been established, but added that “students will start making orders over the next few weeks.”
The company believes that there is a demand for the service, although most students pay <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 in tuition fees.
Today’s students are very different in terms of their expectations and wishes than 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago started their studies. Now it’s more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Organization criticizes a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice president of the organization’s higher education department, “this service plan seems to be really far from the life of the majority of students.”
Many start their studies this month to be shocked by the level of living costs, when the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has remained after the huge increase in basic borrowings. Only then can we begin to think about where to find thousands of lump sums to be used as a single item.

Bulgaria's Prison Staff Holds National Protest
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria showed their minds in front of the Sofia Ministry of Justice.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared their wish to return to the old working rules, which were recently amended.
The salary increases are also to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.

Despite the meeting between the Prison Workers' Organisation and the representatives of the Ministry of Justice, there was no agreement on the matter, Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reports.
Negotiations are ongoing, Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the Directorate-General for the Enforcement of Judgments, told BNR.
Members of the trade union of employees of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the protest of the organization of prison workers.
Basketball: Fans’ encouragement almost too: Sasu Salin had turned to the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was today the embodiment of Finland’s victory.
He was able to forget about the fall of his U.S. campaign and trace the blood of the second half of Ukraine with his solutions.
But Salin transferred all the honor to the Susufans and did it in the style of:
I was going to turn there at the end of the field, that encouragement was so great.
In my eyes, but in my mouth, I could do nothing.
The white sea and the white sea were almost too much for me.
Salin’s performance moments included nine surfaces at a rapid pace, ballparks, records, and a touchdown at every place where it happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got to the flow mode that everything worked out.
They're just coming from somewhere, now in a very intrepid place, Sasu said.
That's my role.
Do all of that.
It was great to see that the others got caught.
It caught the whole gang.
Salin is the team’s joy pill and lifeguard, so it’s no wonder that his example brought the whole team to flight, which was too big and too hard for the Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after 32 years of break: The previous one was a tough referee game
Heikki Montonen (a.k.a.) was the head coach of Finland at the 1982 World Cup in Argentina.
It’s been 32 years since the Finnish men’s volleyball team last played in the World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer at the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was the second coach of Finland and the current player agent Jouni Parkkali as the general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as they did yesterday: it was a starting line-up match against France.
"The referee's game in his match-fixing balls was rough," Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled on the back line.
Suddenly, the game was continued.
We lost it 2-3, and then the pigs mixed even more,” Parkkali said.
Finland played for head coach Heikki Montosen and eventually placed 17th.
Now Finland is once again among the world’s elections, when Poland’s World Cup can be reached quickly this Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in international volleyball over the course of 32 years.
The strengths of the players are roughly the same class as before, but the quality and skill is now more.
The average number of players has also increased.
The game is even faster,” Parkkali thought.
But how is it in Poland?
Finland’s player material has expanded, and the burden can be shared.
I look forward to Finland getting to the starting point.
“It can be tough,” Koson said.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were victorious in the match against Tunisia.
Current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup.
Let's hope we get caught up in 17th place.
South Korea and Tunisia should go quietly,” Parkkali said.
Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Lepp<0xC3><0xA4>nen and Kari K<0xC3><0xB6>rkk<0xC3><0xB6> fanned the match in Tunisia.
Sauna and evening entertainment at the Buenos Aires Maritime Church were part of the national team’s program at the 1982 World Cup.
Kari Kalin (oik.) stretched out with his teammates.

Finnish Tourists Rescued From Cita Dog Mountain in Norway: "These Men Deserve All Praise"
When Norway’s Merethe Mikkelsen and her dog got stranded in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini offered their help.
On the weekend, Mikkelsen searched for “international heroes” on Facebook to be able to thank his assistants once again.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that the dog Cita, who was with him in the mountains on Thursday, hurt his pocket.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in the steep terrain.
I tried to take it down myself, but I didn't succeed, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to attract and pull it a little further, but its legs not only carried, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, help did not wake up from the police, from a nearby hotel or from passers-by.
In the dark of the night, the situation was already beginning to look threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Tampere-based Antti Soini and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited Norway’s highest mountain in Galdh<0xC3><0xB8>piggen and headed to their camp when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm with regard to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells Ilta-Sanomi in a message.
Soon, a German man came along with a hiker.
From Patja Cita we got the kind of pairs to which the injured dog was attached.
The German man came to the spot a moment after us, when we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the slope for a moment, Soini says.
KUVA: Tuomo Soini
The dog was brought down with the help of a walker.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically heavy, but in the difficult terrain the load was slow.
However, about half an hour later, the Cita was happily brought down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen was still on Facebook looking for “international heroes” to be able to thank them once again.
The bells answered him on Sunday, but the Germanman is apparently still unreachable.
I don't know what I'd have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen is delighted.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
They certainly don’t know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the praise and honor, I am forever grateful to them.
By Monday night, the Soins were already on their way home.
They had heard from Mikkelsen: - Cita kulemma can do better!

Genetic abnormalities are often misdiagnosed.
A British woman feared death for years because of a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth that he only had a few years to live because he was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It means a set of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord.
According to the Charity CMT UK charity, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
According to estimates, around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms in motor skills, such as muscle weakness, difficulty walking, and soreness of the toes.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he was suffering from Friedreich's Attaxia (FA), which has a very poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would get into a wheelchair before turning 18 and die before reaching the age of 30.
Today, a 51-year-old mother of two children says, “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as others.
I lost every day, and it took me longer than anyone else.
I was never able to skate or skate with other children, and I was teased at school because I walked and ran in a different way than the others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he underwent a number of knee-jerk surgeries to repair his legs. After the surgery, he left the doctor’s room and quickly looked at his research papers, which said he was suffering from an FA certificate.
“I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I came home I checked the information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA,” he says.
When I found out about them, I was shocked and in a state of panic.
I thought I would get into wheelchairs by the age of 18 and die before I turned 25, and in the meantime I would quietly lose all my ability to function.
I went through this for myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the time he was 17, he found that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "Girl honey, I don't think you have this disease because otherwise you would already be in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous.
According to some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
“When I was told what CMT is, I thought I was retarded,” she says.
Charity CMT UK organizes the CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
Hundreds of migrants were found in a coal truck in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than a hundred illegal immigrants from a coal-carrying train, the country’s interior ministry said on Monday.
Most of the passengers were Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The migrants were found late on Sunday from Veles from Central Macedonia.
It was difficult to communicate with most of them.
They did not know where they were, where they came from and where they are going," Interior Ministry spokesman Ivo Koteski said.
According to the police, the migrants had paid about 3,000 euros each to get to Greece, and another 800-900 euros more to get to Serbia.
Illegal immigrants travel extensively through Macedonia with a population of a couple of million on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have already fled the Syrian civil war.
The Guardian: Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai support Scotland's independence
Popes Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai have joined the supporters of Scottish independence.
According to The Guardian, the bands are set to host a concert in Edinburgh in a couple of weeks’ time to support the independence project.
A referendum on Scottish independence will be held on 18 September.
In his announcement, Mogwai said that the vote is an opportunity for the Scots, which only happens to the target once in their life.
Previously, actor Sean Connery has given his support to independence, among other things.
Instead, for example, British thanks to Paul McCartney and David Bowie have bet on the Scots to remain a part of Britain.
In the Gallup, the supporters of independence have been at a loss.

On the other hand, the sales of daily items have increased by almost a percent.
Joan Rivers family "best wishes"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was brought to a hospital in central New York City, but her daughter was hoping today that the 81-year-old comedian would recover from her illness.
“Thank you for your continued love and support,” wrote Melissa Rivers today.

Areva-Siemens: Olkiluoto's three-phase reactor will be completed in mid-2016
Areva has submitted an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3 to TVO for the Industrial Power.
According to Areva, the project’s recent delays have mainly been due to the fact that approval has been sought for the reactor’s automation systems.
The project is already years late.
In May, the TVO did not provide any assessment of the time of completion of the three-stage reactor.
Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of beach to Bottax - worth about 60000 euros
The municipal government of Nastola donated a 1.4-hectare beach to Valtteri Bottax from Vill<0xC3><0xA4>hte.
The municipal government showed a fair view of sport and was unanimous in its decision.
The sounds were not included in the meeting when the tone was decided, says Mayor Pauli Syryrakki.
Bottak's gift shop has seven farm buildings in total.
We’ll be taking them out this year, except for one.
Bottas has promised to build a two-year free-time apartment for Tonto.
We are delighted that he has enjoyed his birthday and wants to be here in the future as well.
Valtteri has visited the lower levels every year to tell about his sports career and his life.
I hope it will continue, the mayor said.
The mayor considers the beach to be a financial value of between EUR 40000 and EUR 60000.
The beach is low and child-friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for many years.
Over the decades, Nastola has enjoyed a varying success in sport with the help of gift vouchers in the municipality.
World champion Aki Parviainen and world champion of aerobics Tuuli Matinsalo got their own homes from the municipality and built their own houses.
However, they did not stay in Nastola but sold their property and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsalo came to Nastola after work and then changed their life situation elsewhere.
Bottas is a native of Nastolan and his situation is different, Syriac inch and believes Bottas to remain in his homeland.
Hull raided the attacker with Hernandez's tracking record
Election Commissioner Hull placed a follow-up record for the acquisition of Uruguayan national teamman Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez will replace Hull's Italian tour from Palermo with <0xC2><0xA3>9.5 million, or around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12 million.
The contract is three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo won the Serie B and rose to the top of Italy.
In the Uruguayan national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 games.
In last summer’s World Cup final, Hernandez came to the field in two games.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short time, said Hull head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull said he had also acquired Senegalese national team captain Mohamed Diamen West Ham.
Russia's Space Experiment Failed - Cheats Sent to Sex Journey Dead
Five small geckos sent into space by Russia have died, the Russian Federation’s space agency Roscosmos said in a statement.
The geckos traveled on the Foton-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to Earth on Monday morning in Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to investigate the growth capacity and use of geckos in a non-weighted state.
One male gecko and four female participants participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds strange, its purpose was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness, for example, on the development of gecko eggs.
Through the effects of geckos, one can try to predict what effects of weightlessness would be on a human being in a similar state for longer periods of time, observed New Statesman in July.
According to Roscosmo, the time of death and the cause or causes of death of the geckos is determined.
According to the Interfax news agency, passengers who were crucified as "sexy" were frozen.
What is also surprising is the fact that the fruit flies that traveled on the same Foton-M4 wheels survived the journey without any difficulty, and also gained post-growth.
France Arrests Terrorist Suspect at Nice Airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice Airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected to be a recruiter for a jihadist group operating in Syria.
The French authorities reported this on Sunday.
Authorities tracked the man after he had lured a 16-year-old girl with money to go to Syria.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border from there.
The airline did not believe the girl’s explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but warned the authorities.
Authorities contacted the girl’s father, who was completely unaware of her daughter’s intentions, and told authorities that the family had no relatives in Turkey.
According to authorities, the man is from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had been monitoring the man’s actions before.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that radicalised young people who have been drawn to the war in Iraq or Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
Authorities estimate that about 800 French citizens or those who are writing in France have travelled to Syria during the last conflict, returned from there, or are currently planning to leave for Syria.
Team: We have a good chance of winning
The wishes of the basketball team are at stake as Finland meet today in the second match of the World Cup in Ukraine.
If the opening loss to the United States was expected, Ukraine again belongs to those countries from which Finland should take the necessary gains to the next place.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe we have a good chance of winning, Petteri Koponen predicted.
On Saturday, Ukraine defeated the Dominican Republic 72-62 in their first game of the game.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, who leads Ukraine to play aggressive basketball.
The key player of Ukraine is the game director Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-meter world champion three years ago.
Against the Dominican Republic, Jeter dropped 16 points.
“Pooh Jeter is a fast forward, but yes we’ve played against those before and we need to get our normal defense in shape,” Koponen said.
Hanno M<0xC3><0xB6>tt<0xC3><0xB6>l<0xC3><0xA4> promised that Finland would play better than yesterday’s loss to the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can guarantee that the field will see a normal snowflake, M<0xC3><0xB6>tt<0xC3><0xB6>l<0xC3><0xA4> said.
Alleged Hollywood Star Scams Spread Online - Part Confirmed to Be True
There are a number of nude images on the Internet, which are claimed to represent well-known public figures.
Actress Jennifer Lawrence has become the victim of a “nightmare campaign.”
The entertainment site TMZ has published an angry comment by Lawrence’s representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant violation of privacy.
The Estonians have been contacted, and anyone publishing (on the Internet) Jennifer Lawrence's stolen images will be charged, the representatives threaten.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images that spread about her are real.
She had taken these pictures years ago with her husband.
When I know that those images were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a gruesome difficulty was seen for this.
I feel compassion for everyone who has become a victim of hacking, he writes according to the site.
Instead, the actor Victoria Justice says in her own name the moving images are faked.
There are also real or fake nudes from Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grand, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka Painter criticises himself: “They don’t do enough work to get out of here.”
Football club FC Honka is currently in the final position of the Sailing League.
The comments of goalkeeper Walter Viitala on Sunday after the VPS match describe a very confusing current situation.
I haven't had a goalkeeper in four months.
But everything has to adapt," Viitala said after the fight ended in a 1-2 loss.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes, especially in the first half of the match.
The goalkeeper Viitala was not a bad defensive player in his mind.
The game traffic in Hong Kong has been busy this summer, which is why the defenders in front of Viitala have changed to a tight pace.
With the player advantage, many young players have also been given opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some of them don't do enough work to get out of here at some point," Viitala said without naming any individual players.
Honga head coach Shefki Kuqi was somewhat in agreement with Vietala.
“I told certain players after the game that if you come to practice and play to have fun and you think you’re a bettor and don’t have to work, then you’re probably in the wrong team,” Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that players can’t expect immediate success as the game’s friends change constantly.
There has not been the same set-up twice in a row this season.
Especially at the head of the defense, the crew has changed.
That's the biggest reason why we're here," Kuqi said.
Honka is a serial boon after the loss of VPS, with the latter being the last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left in the draw, so the Espolans still have time to avoid falling into the One.
I've never tried the team, and I'm not going to drop now.
We’re not really going to drop out of this series,” Viitala threatened.
Lars von Trier making a TV series after decades of break
Film director Lars von Trier is set to return as the creator of the TV series.
The Danish director prepares a TV series called The House That Jack Built.
The series was told by Louise Vesth, who was the producer of Trier’s films at the Venice Film Festival on Monday.
According to the production company Zentropa, the series of descriptions should start in 2016.
Trier is reported to be involved in the scripting of the series from this autumn.
The series is in English.
Trier’s long-term partner, Peter Aalb<0xC3><0xA6>k Jensen, also known for his strong sales speech, also speaks about the mysterious project.
According to him, a similar series "has never been seen and will never be seen".
"Hold your breath," Aalb<0xC3><0xA6>k Jensen said in a statement.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been known for his violent media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac in recent years.
In the 1990s, he directed the television series Kingdom.
01.09.2014 15:20 The trade chain Lidl seems to have received the Finns on its side, at least if there is a belief in the numbers.
Lidl Suomi Kommandiittiyhti<0xC3><0xB6> (Lidl Suomi Kommandiittiyhtij<0xC3><0xB6>), which operates in Lidl Finland, continued to grow during the financial period ending at the end of February.
The company also increased its profits.
Earnings before taxes amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>79.6 million, compared to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>56.4 million a year earlier.
Turnover increased from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>960 million to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 billion.
The growth was 25 percent.
The company, which increased its market share, also improved its operating profit from EUR 61 million to EUR 84 million.
The operating profit percentage was 7.1.
The accounting period of the German-speaking Lidl lasts from the beginning of March to the end of February.
The company reports a tax on Finland for the financial year ending in February of EUR 13.7 million.
The company, which has continuously expanded its retail pension chain, has announced that it will invest EUR 100 million in Finland this year.
There are currently 142 Lidl stores in Finland and it employs more than 4,000 employees.
The first shops were opened in 2002.
Ice Bucket Challenger Takes a Break from Place
British Isabelle Roberts cried so hard when she was covered in ice-cold water that she damaged the skeleton of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
The woman has been treated for the Ice Bucket challenge when she is performing so hard that her sneezing went away.
Isabelle Roberts cried so hard when cold water was poured on her that she damaged the structure of her face.
“The water was so cold that I just screamed, but as I screamed, I felt my skull began to stiffen,” he told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts just before the accident.
I tried to close my mouth, but I couldn't, my leg was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing, and they started laughing, but I had to applaud the first aid.
A 20-year-old British man who took part in a super-favourable challenge on Tuesday was taken to a hospital where he was placed back in his place.
Video length has become an Internet censorship, and it has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
View of the wolf’s surface (also): How can the increase in fan numbers be explained?
It was a great filibuster today.
That’s what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, when Finland played in the European Championship against France at the Athens Marouss Ball Hall.
Not Peach's exaggeration.
I remember the game when I was there.
There were also about one hundred Finns, who were shouting at 20,000 spectators, otherwise the empty hall roared.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the World Cup Finland-Ukraine?
In Bilbao, the forces of one hundred Finnish fanatics are eighty times.
The 1995 European Championships were a defining moment for Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, a Russian scratching match at the Helsinki Sports Hall.
That victory would open the doors to the European cream.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno M<0xC3><0xB6>tt<0xC3><0xB6>l<0xC3><0xA4>.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann brought M<0xC3><0xB6>tt<0xC3><0xB6>l<0xC3><0xA4> to the final tournament team with the limelight.
A solution that many people disagree with.
Now it can be said that Dettmann was far from wise, even though everything did not go according to the script.
After arriving in Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
There were, of course, over a hundred Finns in the streets of Athens.
These included the journalists, the relatives of the players, the Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are also journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown into unfathomable proportions.
No one can say the exact number of Finnish hunters.
Estimates have ranged from 7,500 to 10,000.
Any number in between is an unfathomable number.
Here's an explanation for the sports psychologists.
In the global economy, businesses are moving across borders.
In sports, there is still an opportunity to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can go to see how our girls and boys succeed in the world,” says Hannu Itkonen, professor of motion sociology.
Surely there are Finns in both Spain and the World Cup in Poland who are looking for an experience.
A common experience.
Yet it does not explain everything.
There has to be an attraction in the sport itself.
Itkonen makes sport a part of popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to go to sports than to Berlin to see art.
Without success, the masses will not be able to move.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time, head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball league and even the players to throw themselves professionally in top sports.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the ground team activity was raised on foot.
The Air Force made the same move a little earlier.
Now they both enjoy the fruits of their labor.
As Itkonen says, both species have succeeded in producing their top sport, where the sacred trinity works: sports media sponsors.
The public is also interested.
And the media has taught what this kind of carnivalistic support is, Itkonen recalls.
Will the ball players be able to transfer this massive interest to the home series as well?
On average, basketball and volleyball are played for hundreds or a little over a thousand spectators.
I think the question is a good question, and it doesn’t necessarily give an answer that would promise very good species.
The second school believes the interest will shift.
The second is the one who does not want a sweet earth full.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, the domestic series is not of dual interest.
There is a challenge for the followers in the middle of the drug.
Bottaksen tonnage assurance - almost 1.5 hectares from the shore of the lake
Nastola is awarded with the Valtteri Bottaks beach tattoo by the formula carrier.
At its meeting on Monday, the municipal government unanimously approved the distribution of 1.4 hectares of land.
In the future, Tontille will have a free-time apartment.
The success of Bottax has been monitored in Nastola since this karting period.
He is tried as a good envoy to market Lahti, Lahti region and Nastola.
Gahjatontti is located in Koiskala, on the shore of K<0xC3><0xA4>rkj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi.
It has become the property of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate trade.
There are seven buildings in the district, six of which will be demolished by the end of this year at the expense of the municipality.
Bottas reached his fourth prize-winner in this year’s Belgian Formula One competition.
He is fifth in the World Cup.
Bottas is a native of Nastolan and lived in Vill<0xC3><0xA4>hte during his childhood.
He currently lives in England but visits Nastola whenever there are free formulas.
Bottas has visited high schools as well as youth facilities.
Design smart clothes come - but hardly for the poor
It will present and test them at the U.S. Open in New York.
The testers of Ralph Lauren’s smart shirts are the field’s ballplayers, but also Marcus Giron, an amateur at the top of the university players, holds that.
According to him, the shirt helps him to monitor his own development and regulate his recovery.
The nylon shirt is woven with silver sensors, the information of which is transmitted to the sleeve of the shirt and from there to the smartphone or tablet.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythms, stress and steps.
The muckula, which acts as a central unit, is removed before the shirt is thrown into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not told the exact time for the start of the sale of the shirt and has not even hinted at its price, Tech Times reports.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that invests in smart clothes.
Athos, a Californian, has been selling smart shirts and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing, and muscle work.
Clothes cost hundreds of dollars per piece, and the center unit the size of the thumb they demand will cost two hundred dollars.
It was also written by Red Orbit.
A smart way to save on textbooks
The cost of college textbooks in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so soon Matt Schroeder, who started his second year of study, invented a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which students of later year courses borrow their books for nominal compensation instead of selling the books on the same road.
“My math book would normally have paid $180; I paid $10 for its use for the whole semester, and a thousand sandwiches,” says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says that his last-year book would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on it.
According to the University Board of Management, an average student spends more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using e-commerce and creative approaches such as the Schroeder idea.
An increasing number of students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay significantly less for it than the students buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, a company with more than 250 campus bookstores, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the sector reveal that about a quarter of university bookstores last spring had rental books, says Trevor Meyer, president of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save clear money.
Online Shops
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained at a third of the price it would cost in the on-campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" is priced at nearly $290, but Chegg.com's book is priced at $239.99.
Buy when used
Used books are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by other people’s notes and outdated appearance.
For example, the "Calculus" book gets used from the Chegg.com online store for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, a 25-year-old student at Brigham Young University, says he bought the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" from Amazon.com for just $0.42.
The new book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts's Amherst's College Without Walls School and other academics recommend that students ask their professors whether previous weights can be used on the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new pressure are not essential in terms of teaching.
In this case, the old weight can only be found with a fraction of the price, which should cost a new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
Renting textbooks should be considered if you take good care of them, remember to return them and you do not need them once you complete the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% of the price of a new book.
For example, renting a Calculus book for the whole semester costs about $20.
Learn about the rules of the rental company, such as reminders, how to use and wear the accent pen for the following payments.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Buying e-books instead of regular papers can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are rented, which means that the e-book is paid for by its owner, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc. bookstores.
Chegg will receive the "Calculus" e-book for about $61 a month.
According to Bracey, many literature students save the most, as many classics can now be downloaded for free, while science and technology books can be very expensive.
It is worth comparing the different sellers, which option you then choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to embark on Pepperdine’s legal career, recommends using the book’s ISBN number to find out the price, as it can help make sure you’re looking for the right book.
Before you order online, make sure that the book is certainly in stock, Gault says.
He himself learns through this heel.
The delivery of the book he had purchased was on hold for four weeks, and he was eventually forced to purchase the book at full price from the university's bookstore.
Tampere Legionnaire celebrates 20 years

Almost double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
This year, fires have killed nearly twice as many people as last year.
According to the media association of the Finnish Rescue Agency (Spek) so far, 55 people have been killed in 49 different fires.
At the same time last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
More than 65 years of age have been 11.
According to the organisation's fire death statistics, the worst situation was last in 2009, when 64 people had died in the fires by the end of August.
Most of the fires occur in homes.
There have been 17 fire deaths in apartment buildings, 21 in private houses, and seven in row and other small houses.
Spek reminds us of the doubling of fire safety in our home.
According to Spek, at least all home fire alarms should work.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial deactivation tools are easily available.
There must also be an unobstructed exit route from all the premises of the home.
Children should also be told what electrical appliances they can use when they are alone at home.
NATO Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport City to march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at the Cardiff City Hall at the so-called summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events over the weekend and spoke with the protesters, who had arrived there even from Belgium.
Young people rescued by plane from the Australian Blue Mountains
KAKSI teenagers were taken to safety after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in the New South Wales region of Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man left for Blackheat on Sunday after midnight.
The owners were worried about the young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8 p.m.
The search party, made up of local police officers and aides, was sent to look for young people, and the two were found around 11 p.m. near the Bridal Veil falls.
The girl had broken her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
The police spent the night with a couple, and they were taken to safety on Monday morning.
The pathologists were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian military withdraws from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were ordered to retreat.
According to Ukraine, the paratroopers have teamed up with Russian tanks in the field.
According to the army representative, the counter-party firing rifle has been so accurate that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
During the past day, seven Ukrainian soldiers have been killed.
Ukraine’s party ship, which received a piece of art on the South-Eastern Ukrainian coast, sank in the morning, the border guard said.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard wasn't sure from where they were shot.
Separatists reported on social media yesterday the beginning of their shooting.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that Ukrainian troops must immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, in the Minsk negotiations today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE, there should be an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
Lavrov also reminded that Russia will respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions about our partner’s actions, Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains caused flooding in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> and Copenhagen
The roads flooded in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> and Copenhagen on Sunday, when heavy roads swept through southern Sweden and Denmark.
The flood waters would cut off several of you, mix traffic and bury cars underneath.
On Sunday, the authorities estimated that the flooding could last, even though the rains were predicted to end on Monday.
Heavy rains were a surprise to the Swedish authorities, and no weather warnings were given in advance.
Meteorologist Ari Mustala, a Finnish meteorologist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rainfall in the area was very local.
The rain area looks narrow and is in place permanently.
No wonder it was hard to predict.
French socialists should “keep quiet and help France,” says Francois Hollande’s chief
Valls called on the deeply divided left to “show their feelings” towards a struggling socialist president who, with the composition of the new government, did not receive the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
“Our job is to stay with him,” Valls said, earning the applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the prime minister called on the government to leave the French government alone, despite the controversial 35-hour work week of the new Minister of the Economy, Emmanuel Macron earlier this week, to discuss the proposal that the rule should be obeyed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, Minister of Justice Christiane Taubira gave a special speech to the meeting of the Socialist representatives who gave dissenting opinions and criticized the Socialist Party for allowing "France to give up hope for the future".
Marine Le Pen, the head of the far-right National Front, ridiculed the socialists for their continuing differences and said he did not believe the new Valls government would last a few months longer.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but so did Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the previous one did not last even during the summer.
“No new government will last until autumn or winter,” Le Pen told reporters.
He reiterated his party's proposal for the dissolution of the parliament and considered sure his party's electoral victory in the early elections and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the municipal elections in March, and the far-right held a record high in the May EU elections.
According to an opinion poll published in the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party may split into several competing groups before the end of the Dutch season in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Po, warned that the French would soon lose their patience unless the new socialist government managed to improve the economy and record high unemployment.
“There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly realize that change is taking place,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get even worse.
The pokka cheated Huomenta Huomenta The pokka of Finnish swimmers Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda cheated badly in the recorded part of the program.
Tomorrow Finland’s programme published a funny video on its Facebook page last Thursday about the recordings made on Thursday.
In the video, broadcasters Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record the morning after the next day’s broadcast, but the tape does not go completely to the tube.
Alm-Sira is confused in his words as he tries to put the word into the budget line, and his confusion also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their bag once in a while.
And these heroes should be allowed to pull the live broadcast even tomorrow, says Hoomenta in the Finnish Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been liked and shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked in the photo agency of the magazine, placed third in the series of portraits in 1972.
The photo shows Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
A meeting of the Socialist International was held in May 1971 at the Fredrikinkadu building masters’ house in Helsinki.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting, and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir was in the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with her.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had a lot of time to describe it.
I took this picture four or five meters away.
The light and the background were there.
I immediately realized that this time I was successful.
It is clear from Meiri’s appearance that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time in the past.
In the competition, you will be able to take pictures of well-known people or events.
It is great that today you can succeed with other images as long as there is an idea and a visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is the fall of Lasse Virén from the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Claim: Aarnio research has already paid more than five million euros
The investigation into the legality of the operation of the Helsinki Police Drug Unit has already paid more than five million euros and required 30-50 years of work.
This is how Jyri Rajam<0xC3><0xA4>ki evaluates in his thesis at the University of Jyv<0xC3><0xA4>skyl<0xC3><0xA4>.
Rajam<0xC3><0xA4>ki suggests that the monitoring of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be improved significantly by combining investigative and legal information technology systems.
According to Rajam<0xC3><0xA4>ki, current technology enables the multi-use of criminal engineering materials.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected to investigate the crime is automatically filled with electronic evidence and at the same time allows for comprehensive legality control.
The case will be examined on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the wall of the school: "Fish and chicken foods belonging to the vegetarian diet"
A photo of the special message on the wall of the Women’s Journey school in Pirkkala has caused a food shortage on social media, says Yle on its website.
Vegetable eaters!
The vegetable diet includes fish and canned food at the school lunch.
Only when there is meat on the list, we prepare a vegetable option!
This is stated on the wall of the school, in a 15-year-old report.
You can see the picture here.
The image shared on social media has caused people to send irritating feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, head of the food and cleaning service, tells Yle that the forgotten note on the wall is not in place and it should have been removed some time ago.
Apparently, before my arrival, there has sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed with health care in its time.
Every student gets a meal according to his wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, students in Pirkkala schools are offered a vegetarian option only with the permission of parents and with a certificate of a vegetarian diet from a doctor or health care provider.
Vaarma justifies the solution for Yle because young people’s plant-eating experiments may leave the diet unnecessary, and the lack of meat or chicken may arouse wonder from the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise close to $3 billion worth of Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise company, is negotiating to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for $3 billion. The data is based on closely related individuals.
With the transaction, Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of $6.8 billion, would have the luxury cruisers and wealthy customers of Prestige Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CC).
According to sources, information on a possible agreement may be published as early as this week, but it is also possible that negotiations will not produce results.
Prestige Cruises, the owner of the private equity investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruises.
The sources did not want their names to be made public, because negotiations were not held in public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment and the Apollo representative refused to comment.
Miami-based Norwegian Cruise has 13 cruise lines, the route map of which covers North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its net sales grew by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, with net sales of $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which operates both from Miami, sails under the Oceania and Regent brand names, which include a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit the growth of emerging economies, such as China and India, in the coming years.
The companies are competing to become the first choice of these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises will register its first operating stock in the U.S. stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company’s shares since the 2007 sale, which was worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 with its current line-up, Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), and the latter is the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in the Norwegian Cruise Company in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the published data, Genting’s share of the company was 28 per cent, Apollo 20 per cent and TPG Capital LP’s share of private equity investment company 8 per cent from the end of June onwards.
The combined share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises in North America is 82 per cent of the cruise capacity, according to the prestige cruise company’s registration document published in the context of the transaction.
The Tampere City Council is dealing with this today.
Animalia wishes the city government a strong support for the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, the Director of Animal Science at the University of Tampere, who is preparing a thesis for the University of Tampere, during the dolphinariums in Finland and around the world, it is necessary to end quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years, there has been a widespread view around the world that dolphin-like evolved mammals in dolphinariums are not animal-protective or ethically sustainable.
This view should also be applied to Tampere.
The termination of the dolphinarium is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question of Tampere’s image as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara notes.
According to the judge, the death of N<0xC3><0xA4>si-Delfin confirms the requirements for the subsurface of dolphinarium activities.
The death of Nasi is a sad continuation of the dark history of the S<0xC3><0xA4>rk<0xC3><0xA4>nniemi dolphinarium.
It’s time to put a stop to the dead, close the dolphin prison, and start figuring out how to transfer the dolphins to a limited marine area in Tampere, some kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara demands.
The nose could not experience a return to the original habitat of the dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in S<0xC3><0xA4>rk<0xC3><0xA4>nniemi were able to experience even more life than their unspoilt concrete, Tuomivara hopes.
The aim of the Animal Welfare Association is to prohibit the use of all wild animals in circuses as part of the comprehensive reform of the Animal Welfare Act under preparation.
There are also dolphins in this group.
In support of the requirement, Animalia’s Executive Director, Tuomivaara, will participate in today’s event on behalf of dolphins.
At the Embassy of Japan in Helsinki, the declaration of the mind takes a stand against the dolphin hunting season that is taking place in Japan.
During the hunting season, approximately 2,300 dolphins are imprisoned or brutally killed every year, either for use by dolphins or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations on a new state with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately start negotiations on a different region's "state ownership," Russian news sources say.
His representative Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine would have to be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking region its people the power to defend their own interests.
Putin’s insistence on negotiating with the Russian rebels on an equal footing with the rebels in Kiev is in line with his apparent strategy, which he has followed since the violence began five years ago: he seeks to help the separatists to overthrow and overthrow the separatists.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 TV channel, Putin condemned the efforts of the Ukrainian army to retake the separatist-controlled eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, which the separatists seized in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently dubbed the region "Novorossiya", "New Russia" - this term is reminiscent of the days before the Russian Revolutions.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace talks are “an illusion” as long as Ukrainian politicians carry out campaigns for the October 26 parliamentary elections and government forces are attacking separatist-held areas against civilians.
“We need to start immediately extensive negotiations, not only on technical matters, but also on the organization of society and on the status of the state of South-Eastern Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there,” he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "state ownership" is related to a broader independence, which has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership in its attempt to dispel fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov says.
There can be no discussions on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because it is not the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but the internal conflict of Ukraine."
The Kremlin’s interim statement, which aimed to correct Putin’s comments on the “misinterpretation”, stressed that the Russian government is dealing with the separatist uprising in the eastern regions in a way different from that of Crimea, when it practically regards your power as an area with a population of 2 million.
Moscow would be considerably more difficult to connect even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, because the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian, and because, according to pre-conflict polls, the majority of the population in Ukraine was supported by the Holy See.
The independence that the Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give the local Ukrainian authorities the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin a practical look at the power zone that unites Russia.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to Russia’s main fleet, as well as commercial maritime port areas and historic coastal sites.
The area between Rostov and Crimea in Russia also has mines, factories and metallurgical plants that produce vital products for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, in his inaugural address on 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian legislators – after the new elections – consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of regions other than Ukraine’s core region from their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from the view of the Kremlin and Moscow, perhaps armed and Lithuanian separatists.
Putin presented his latest demand to the Kiev government for negotiations with the Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels advanced in the past week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from the formerly peaceful coastal area of the Azov Sea.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that the seizure of the Russian-backed city of Novoazovsky by separatists is the beginning of a larger effort aimed at conquering the entire strategically important coastal area as far as Crimea.
It has led massive civilian and military personnel to implement the reinforcement of the city of Mariupol. Mariupol, a half million inhabitants, is known as a steel-producing port city, located between the narrow land area leading to Novoazovsky and the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke in Brussels on Saturday to European Union leaders about additional measures to prevent Russia's future violations in Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take direct action decisions; the leaders put forward additional sanctions so that they can be put in place if the Ukrainian crisis re-emphasizes in uncertain circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the territory of Ilovaysk after the transfer of two Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 soldiers to the territory of Donetsk last week in order to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers to enter Ilovaisk in Russia was exchanged for 10 Russian paratroopers, who were captured in the Ukrainian territory a week ago.
The opening goal of Milan was made by Japanese striker Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute of the game.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari hit first and a little later Jeremy Menez hit the penalty shootout.
Lazio also got a tougher shot at the end of the game, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez opposed Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
In the training debut of Milan's former attacking icon Inzaghi, the San Siro Stadium was only half-way.
39,000 spectators were announced as the public of the match.
Australian public and Gabi Grecko at the roundabout of the nude film scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he has been stalking hackers after perhaps stealing the nudes of his fiancé and Hollywood A-lister Gabi Grecko.
In the entertainment world, it’s been a while since Jennifer Lawrence’s nudes were published on the Internet as a result of a widespread public-censored cybercrime scandal.
Hackers have been told to own a total of 60 nude Hunger Games stars from Lawrence as well as other superstars, including top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actor Kirsten Dunst.
The images of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Grecko living in Melbourne have also apparently been stolen during the iCloud flood.
There are 101 names on the list.
Grecka, who was interviewed last month by Edelsten, told the Confidential newspaper, “This is defamatory.”
All personal contact and photos should remain private. <0xE2><0x80><0xA2>
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
Grecko, who is in New York City, is reported to have commented on the case in the online magazine as “shy” and saying that the victims “feel embarrassed.”
The hacker is believed to have 30 pictures of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two samples of Palmer on the topless edge of the pool.
Palmer's film interests include the film "Love and Honor" with actor Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck series star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked images yesterday.
Lawrence’s representative told TMZ that “it’s a gross violation of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen was angry at the hacker in a tweet: "The publication of stolen images does not differ in any way from the sale of the stolen product."
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, only from a legal point of view.
Finland played almost like their home field and rose to a sensational victory over Cuba in the World Cup.
Look at the pictures of the fandom.
Poland's Katowice was white on Monday: not the Polish's red-white, but the Finnish's blue-white.
Finland’s win was followed by almost 2,000 Finnish bidders at Spodek Arena, according to STT.
It felt like he was playing at home.
The fans had such a big impact on our games, Finnish captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland were already losing in the match in the range 0-2, but rose to victory in the range 3-2.
In the fourth quarter, Finland made a six-point lead.
Cuba led some 16-10, but after that the Finns got on top of the charm.
However, the Finnish fans in Paris were disappointed when a charter machine failed to land due to Katowice’s heavy fog.
So fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the game.
Finnish football fans have conquered Europe at a rapid pace in the last few days.
In Bilbao, Spain, over 8000 Finnish fans are present at the World Cup.
Just as every Finnish basket would have been the winner of the match, US star player Stephen Curry encouraged Finnish basket fans after Saturday’s match.
