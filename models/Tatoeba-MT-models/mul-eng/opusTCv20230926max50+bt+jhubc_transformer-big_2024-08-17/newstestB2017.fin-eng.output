28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco shopping mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on the steps of a local mall this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally got his case in order."
The body found at Westfield Shopping Center on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco-born Frank Galician, according to the San Francisco Law Enforcement Agency.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a mental disorder.
The victim’s brother Louis Galicia told ABC’s KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job when he escaped the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant’s chef six months ago.
A representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock to them all.
"We are a small and tight team, like a family. We miss the big one," the representative says.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells Frank that he first lived in hostels, but he had finally got his case in order.
"He found an apartment and he had a girlfriend," Louis Galicia told the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
“He was kind and generous.
His way of being with the family was to put food on all of us,” says Louis Galicia.
“He never wanted to have a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who went with the flow.
Despite all the mistakes in the world, he was a ruthless diamond that shone every day,” he says.
In all cases, some information is requested to call the San Francisco Police Department at 415-575-4444.
Junior doctors calling for new work-related measures to be taken
The representatives of British junior doctors (mostly specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and have asked for permission for new work-fighting measures in their new work contract dispute.
The Junior Physicians Committee (JDC), which is part of the British Medical Association (BMA), is calling on the entire government to support additional work-related measures from the beginning of September.
According to the JDC, the ministers have not solved the problems of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students opposed the agreement with the BMA in a vote held in July.
58% of the members who took part in the vote opposed the agreement.
The chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, Ellen McCourt, posted a letter on Twitter Thursday evening to JDC members, saying the government was "self-motivated" about issues that, according to McCourt, led to a breach of the agreement.
The letter reads: “In light of this, the JDC government, in its vote, has completely opposed the new draft agreement and calls for new formal negotiations on all of our concerns.
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC government has today submitted an official request to the BMA government, asking for permission for the least-advanced expansive work-actions starting in early September.”
I doubt, therefore, that the junior doctors have been in the lake six times this year, which included the first perfect workstations ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, the head of BMA’s junior doctors, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms recommended by BMA.
Malawana told the BMA members at the pre-voting meetings that the agreement was good and should be accepted, with 54,000 junior doctors and medical students taking part in the vote.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement will come into force and applies to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
It was the elephant that decided the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to reach an agreement and bring to an official conclusion the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
When Vladimir Putin took his Turkish brother-in-law against him in the golden hall of his St. Petersburg palace, however, I got the clear impression that there was a greater desire for reconciliation in Ankara.
Yes, the parties agreed,
But Putin’s smile seemed to be thin, and he didn’t just lighten the heat even on his own sticky scale.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his “good friend” Mr. Putin – according to one report five times.
I didn't stay on the bill myself.
In addition, he promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote about Erdogan’s behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I realized his enthusiasm on the contrary.
But Putin’s constant whining showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the reason for the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the incident was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara in the strongest terms and accused him of stabbing his back.
The insult was even greater because it came from an unlikely friend.
Getting real trust back will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The general opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of it all.
The most serious were allegations by top officials that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in the Isis-held areas of Syria.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an has strongly denied the accusations.
However, the official message from St. Peter was that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting was held only so that Putin could demand an apology from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could win some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring a settlement in Ankara are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost expelled from power last month in a failed coup d'état.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly reassured him.
The agreement also has an economic impact.
Russia’s sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially a charter flight ban, as several million Russian tourists travel to Turkey’s coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90 percent.
As far as Russia is concerned, travel organisers and charter companies will surely be delighted with the ease when air traffic can finally be resumed.
They will put their faith in the late song of flight to the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruits and vegetables will fall when imports of Turkish agricultural products are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," was drafted in the Vedemosti article.
But the visit also had greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West, because it believes that the West is reacting quietly to the coup.
Not to mention the long-running Turkish EU membership negotiations and Putin’s lack of things, Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the cool media and disturb Turkey’s ties to the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected authorities after the coup d'état.
This was self-evident for Moscow, which has its own concerns about the change of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey, at their summit in the Prama Seafront Palace, were able to convey a picture that one analyst described as an "outside alliance": the two countries, which experienced being rejected by the West and treated badly, join forces.
Despite public reconciliation, the two still have a lot of disagreements.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created a picture of itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It says a lot that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents said at a press conference that they had not addressed the issue at all.
The Turkish president deliberately refused to answer the question of the differences between the countries, while Putin stressed them.
There is no clear consensus among the countries on where they could seek consensus in Syria.
Given the possibility of a full disaster caused by NATO member Turkey when shooting down a Russian fighter jet, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two heads of state are still in the middle of talks.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks are disappearing from customers outside of Scotland
According to RBS’s CEO, the bank’s operations outside Scotland will be reduced in such a way that it will only continue to offer business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is losing its customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally associated with the bank’s global goals.
The bank had to backtrack from its goals when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsored millions of pounds of international sports, such as the Six Nations rugby union and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right for the front sector to release more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but will not use the RBS abbreviation.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWest, with the exception of head office and stock listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed by customers and staff during a presentation in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: “RBS is becoming an investment brand and that’s why our staff are at the service because we are now becoming a much more diverse brand bank.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands.”
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby, and it has raised the profile of different brands in sports sponsorship.
“Now is the right time to move to a bank with different brands, because basically the question is how we can make a bank better for customers,” says the bank’s CEO.
“Three years ago, it would have been very nasty if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and put brands in place.
But the work we do and the focus on customer needs instead of our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.”
Frankie Dettori rode Predilection to win at Newmarket and achieved his 3,000th win
Dettori showers the champagne after winning twice in a row at Newmarket, which meant he won 3,000.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th win in the British Championship at Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved this milestone by riding his horse in Predilection twice on the same night on the track of his own town. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing on a flat track.
He has previously been joined by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won in Ghayari, says: "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
The event is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and a 20,000-person audience.
I am relieved and I feel great humility.”
The Doctor Takes Hurts With Predilection After Winning
Two jockeys have reached the top of their career in cross country wrestling, and they are champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has won more than 4,300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of his time, and it's no surprise that he's just reached this milestone that few have gotten to.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactical prowess is what sets him apart from the rest.
He is a fantastic representative of the turtle support, his enthusiasm and enthusiasm have brought the species to the supporters for years."
“I told Frank a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races if he hadn’t competed only on weekends and only in big races!
Hardly speaking, Frankie’s horseback riding in the UK has been profitable for almost 30 years, which has been a great track record.
He’s a lively person, which is good for British turtle support, but above all he’s an incredible jockey.”
Frankie Dettori fanned his achievement in a distinctive way by jumping down from the back of his horse.
"Frankie Dettori has been a model for the British shipyard for two decades now, from low-cost aircraft to low-cost aircraft.
We've got ups and downs on the way.
He has won numerous major leagues, including his famous win at Ascot in 1996's "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived a flight accident and been banned for drug abuse.
When the ban on racing ended three years ago, he had trouble starting, but he showed an amazing strength of character, showed his doubters, and returned to his best.
And he’s not going to finish his career for a while – Dettori has recently said he wants to continue racing until he’s at least 50 years old.”
Putin resigns as head of government Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin abruptly resigned his head of government, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin’s inner circle for several years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
According to a statement from the Kremlin, President Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration", but no justification was given for the resignation.
Anton Vaino, who has served as Ivanov’s deputy director since 2012.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Vaino, born in Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later headed the president’s protocol department and government office, according to the Kremlin’s Russian-language website.
Vaino thanked Putin for his nomination, saying: "I am grateful for your trust.
In my opinion, the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as the head of state, which means making bills and monitoring how your instructions are implemented."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for a divorce and recommended Vaina to his successor.
Are the smiles genuine?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been a close friend of Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he also has a history of the KGB.
As a manager, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a meeting on Russian state television with President Putin, both said that Ivanov would resign at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations are only convincing to a few, especially under the parliamentary elections.
Is it the result of some sort of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has taken a very suspicious view of the official claim that a man named a possible president suddenly wants to lead Russia’s environmental policy.
The Kremlin’s website presents Ivanov’s words to Putin, in which he says: “It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complex and to some extent even a difficult task for four years.
I have now served as the President’s Executive Director for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
When Putin served as head of the KGB's replaced Federation Security Service (FSB) in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed deputy head of the KGB.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted the most.
At one time, it was thought that Ivanov might become Russian President after Putin’s second term, as the constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for a third term.
However, the mission went to another near Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, after which he returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds – FBI Investigators star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a violent fight at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, reported the kick-off in their joint statement.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, known for the series, had filed an apology on Thursday before his resignation was announced.
“We had a lot of creative disagreements.
I'm sorry this happened," he said in a statement.
The details of how Gibson’s character will be written out of the next series of FBI agents will be released later, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios said in a statement.
Previously on the comedy series Dharma & Greg, 54-year-old Gibson has been in the series since its first production season, starting in 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement.
“I was hoping to see the end of the series, but it’s not possible anymore.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production team and most importantly: the best fans the series could have ever hoped for.”
The 12th season of the series begins in the United States on September 28.
Mysterious Beaching of Fish in Banff Gardens
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are windy fish that have landed in the country in the form of a swirling storm.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the beach, published the footage on Periscope and hoped to get an answer for the emergence of these five-cent fish.
Queensferry is now connected to Fife
At a cost of <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion, the project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected Queensferry across the north bank and the country bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four sections between the "carrier beams" that are now almost ready around the bridge's three pillars.
Fifesta is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 tractors.
At a cost of <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion, the project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Cabinet Minister Keith Brown, who is responsible for the economy, visited the country today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Transcontinental.
We are all witnessing a very significant step forward in the construction of the bridge, with more than 30,000 concrete and steel were used to build this bridge.
Despite its massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a fine-grained operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
The entire bridge deck is now almost 79% in place, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete deck in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be lifted to its place."
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The completion of the first part of the bridge is always a significant milestone in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this part represents the top of the road and water construction industry.
After the last part of the road had been installed and connected to the North Tower tunnel, after which we had to close the remaining northern (so-called terrestrial) ditch.
This was done by pulling from the north shore 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time highly accurate operation.
It is massive because it is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a tilt angle of about 3%.
And high accuracy required, because the tolerances that the work team had to comply with were very small – just a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well.”
Moelfre Bay rescue agency says three men have been miraculously rescued
Anglesey, in front of his fishing boat, three men who had been rescued from the water were like a miracle shop.
The Moelfre RNLI Marine Rescue Station made an alert on Friday at 1.20 p.m. local time in its crew's Moelfre Bay bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim safely while their boat continued to run unhurt without a guide.
“We saw the boat circled right next to them, and we imagined the worst,” said Vince Jones, Moelfren’s rescuer.
“By the time we got to the water, the strong winds had fortunately carried the boat away from them.”
A local fishing boat rescued two of the men, while a third, aged 60, was found stranded on a boat without a lifeline.
They were all taken to the coast rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, “It’s a miracle that these three men who have been trapped in the water are still alive and perfectly well.
The boat's engine had an emergency detonation hose, but it had, for some reason, detached from the man driving the boat in the event of a crash.
They were really lucky on their way.”
Pokémon Go Hunt Brings Health and Happiness
It’s interesting to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather stay inside to look at their squares.
Pokémon Go makes people get up on the couch and on the move.
Initially, the screen time only took a look at the TV, then came the video games and the latest smartphones.
It is therefore great to note that technology and outdoor sports do not shut down each other.
Pokémon Go is a game application whose characters are derived from video games created in the 1990s (which were later also made into cartoons, game cards and other by-products).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also ended a bit before the new game became available in the beginning of July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
Launching in other countries was delayed due to huge interest, which overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of Pokémon Go users surpassed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
How does the game work?
Briefly explained, players go out to search for Pokémon with their smartphones, which are tracked by GPS. When the Pokémon is found, it can be "photographed" (using the phone's screen image) or "capture".
The award has included the video game of the younger generation who played and raised the back of the sofa.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps taken by the "average person" per day.
The Washington Post recently reported an Apple Watch smartphone app called Cardiogram, which found within two days of the launch of the game that the number of people moving in 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who the users are playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data of the gymnastics.
Many public health campaigns, in which people are encouraged to get on the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day, have lingered on deaf ears, because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have seemed unlucky.
However, the importance of the movement should not be underestimated.
With regular movements, the likelihood of getting cancer or depression is lower.
Exercise helps in weight management, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, it achieves three basic health-supporting things – exercise, fresh air and sun and joy.
During the hunt, it is possible to make even new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also includes unpleasant joy-seekers.
And yes, someone can walk through the door while playing.
What about it?
A breakthrough has been made.
Because even though smartphone apps like Fitbit might have been able to track your activity in the past, they didn’t give you a reason to go ahead, as Pokémon Go does.
The novelty delay disappears, and usage decreases in time.
Thanks to the success of the Pokémon, however, there will be more games in which applications and virtual reality are combined with activity in the real world, which will increase the exercise of people who go hunting and improve their health and well-being.

Simone Biles captures gold in women's multi-stakeholder struggle
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic jumps.
With no strings attached.
You're always barking up your ass.
Brilliant in everything.
And finally, the Olympic winner.
A 19-year-old American gymnast won the multi-stakeholder championship on Thursday and raised the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His total score of 62,198 was clearly better than the silver-placed "Final Five" team scorer Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States will perform at the Women's Figure Skating Competition final on Thursday at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth consecutive and fifth American woman of all time to win the multi-stakeholder championship, thus consolidating her reputation as the best of her generation or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears as his final overall point came to light, and his long journey to this point ended.
The arrival takes the species to completely new dimensions and elevates it to the same category as other sports superstars, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been a completely superpower for the last three years. He has won 15 World Championships, of which 10 golds, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programs that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "all-powerful".
In Brazil, there was still one last competition that took place, above all, between Biles and his self and the burden of excessive expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring with less than a coral gold medal would be a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman of the United States will win gold and silver in the women's individual competition final on Thursday at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles won the first gold on Tuesday as a point i on the ground team coordinated and now retired by Martha Karoly.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything in advance while at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program – which includes a series of volts known as his state card – has been adapted to Latin music, which could well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympics arena.
It's not a coincidence.
As a child, his grandparents adopted him and his mother, coach Aimee Boorman, has become a force figure. Boorman found the girl while he was on a day-to-day tour of the gym, where Boorman was trained.
He has not lost any multi-game competition since the summer of 2013, and the winning pipeline is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a small lead in two laps, it was like a bandage.
The remaining were a pole and a permanto, where Biles has to defend the world champion.
He got back to the lead position after scoring 15,433 points and crowned the final result with a standing of 15,933 points.
Raisman gently hugged him as they waited for the final points – which was just a formality – and tears began to appear around Biles’ red, white and blue glittering borderline color, as his once-in-a-lifetime dream of writing a play came true.
Raisman’s performance was a small rematch for the four-year-old competition, when he first shared third place but then lost to the bronze team in a rematch with Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom Americans call the team "grandfather" was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent air raids to the public after his permanto program and thus rose from the loss station to the winner, which in the meantime seemed uncertain.
As for Bilesi, this 19-year-old earlier this week’s tweet and widespread tweet now has a whole new meaning:
Police say three musics in a car were heard as a victim of a serial killer
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating mass murder for ten years. The victims sat in a car talking and listened to music when they were shot, according to a police report published Thursday.
According to authorities, on June 12, the car parked on the street was shot by Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah.
The gunman stood on the passenger side of the car, from which he shot eight shots in the arm and then fled with another car, the statement said.
The police suspect that the cause of the three murders was not a robbery because the attacker did not take the handbags and did not find the 2,900 dollars from the possession of the second adult clue.
A Phoenix police informant, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says police are now investigating whether the killing is linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two injured in nine attacks, which have occurred mainly in areas inhabited by Latin Americans within four months.
“It’s common for events to happen in residential areas in front of homes,” Howard told CBS’s subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the brown Nissan at the end of the 1990s, the black BMW at the end of the 1990s, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln at the end of the 1990s.
The researchers do not want to reveal what caused them to conclude that the attacks are related to each other and that their cause is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital where he later died due to injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
The eyewitness told police that the three had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police released a statement in which it was reported that an open-air vehicle was being shot just half an hour before the third death. The shooter is believed to be the same in either case.
The researchers found the hatches and took the hatches from the car seat and the hatches from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: “Things are getting better”
Like most 6-year-olds, also Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and of course his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has a microcephaly, or congenital smallpox, which is due to his mother Elizabeth Picciutto’s genetic disorder, which he was unaware of when he was pregnant.
“When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I couldn’t survive.
I can't get over this.
I didn't commit to this.
Which is not true at all – of course you are committed to it,” he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund may never recognize them, or may not survive at all.
Some of the doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in the care of the institution.
“My initial reaction was that I didn’t think such a practice would be any more,” Picciuto says.
Edmund's walking with a roller coaster.
Edmund got up and started counting when he was three years old, and he still doesn't speak.
But he is slowly progressing at his own pace.
He walks with help and drives a bicycle.
He loves to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth introduces Edmund's invention of the term "sing to me".
"We're teaching him a reference language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only refer to the ordinary reference language, but also to the reference language invented by Edmund himself.
The background of microcephaly can be several different diseases: hereditary, such as in the case of Edmund, or gestational viral infections, such as as measles or Zika virus.
There is a big change in symptoms and prognosis.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of people with Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional turmoil caused by the uncertain future.
"How constantly: how we're doing,
How we do."
And he still doesn't know.
“I haven’t asked for a prediction in time, because I don’t think anyone can give it.”
But Picciuto has the hope of giving advice to mothers whose children have birth defects caused by Zikavirus.
“Things are getting better.
Things tend to get organized.
You love your child, and your child loves you.”
Heavy rain and floods have caused large-scale rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
The Louisiana Governor declared a state of emergency on Friday due to heavy rains and widespread flooding, and more rain is expected in the state on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in South Louisiana and South Mississippi are flooding over their cores and spreading to a wide area as a result of heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards says state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the National Security and Emergency Response Agency, said the agency had received requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, only Tangipahoa County has asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning will remain in effect until Saturday in most parts of South Louisiana.
According to the information provided by the weather service, there may be an additional 76–127 mm of water in the area.
A flood warning was issued in southern Alabama on Friday as the rains continued in the Mobile area.
During the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are forecast to rise to record highs.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses on the banks of rivers can be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that flooding downstream in Ascension County poses a threat, as flooding rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
In Liverpool, Louisiana, the Tickfaw River, which flows just south of the Mississippi state border, was already rising higher than ever on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue work continued in Amite and Wilkinson counties in South Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were among those rescued by Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 120 meters away from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
The other boy who lived nearby had warned him.
“We got up and the water came with continuous feeding,” Hansford says.
"It reached to my waist."
His wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she has lived in the area.
Hansford says that he and his family members all have injuries, and he himself is the only one who can swim.
The rescue workers had rescued all three large army-style trucks and taken them to the fire station at Gloster, where they held protection on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says the floods are spreading rapidly as heavy rains continue, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He reports information from an observer near Livingston that it had rained nearly 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the ground was heavily wet after the rains began on Wednesday.
The authorities say that due to the flooding of heavy roads and streets, the residents of Tangipahoa district had to be rescued from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the Tangipahoa City Council had told CBS’s subsidiary WWL that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached them both.
Robby Miller, the county's chief executive, said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been trapped in the flood.
Evacuated shelters have been opened in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
“They will be able to return to their homes when the water starts to recede,” he says.
In the city of Hammond, in Tangipahoa, nearly twenty streets were closed due to flooding, and residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
“The last time we’re in a big flood is in March,” said Lacy Landrum, a member of the city council.
"This flood seems to be equivalent."
Rain in the Mississippi continued evenly along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, said Rupert Lacy, the head of rescue at Harrison County.
Lacy says that on Thursday there were reports of a house under a torrential flood, but so far no information had been received on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods, has been living in the Amite area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and more rain all the time."
6-year-old Mahaj Brown, who has been given several body parts, survives a Philadelphia shooting spree
According to police, a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which is already the second 6-year-old to be shot in the city this week.
The child’s parents told him that his son, Mahaj Brown, was on CBS Philadelphia.
According to the grandparents, the son had several gunshot wounds in the groin, neck, arm and stomach, but he was aware when he was taken to the hospital.
“He got a lot of hits, his little body was full of bullets,” the boy’s grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the television company.
“I can’t believe this is true.”
The boy is in a critical condition in the hospital, and has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the television company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was starting the first class at the local lower level.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
The condition of the other 29-year-old was reported to be critical and the condition of the other two was stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are now investigating whether one of the injured men could be the shooters.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossroad between many armed men.
The place was full of rifle-type rifles, which came from different types of rifles.
“It is quite clear that this was the ongoing battle.
On the street there were stalls on both sides of the walkway.
There have been a number of armed fighters on the scene, and they have been actively involved in the shooting,” said Anthony Ginaldi, a Philadelphia police chief.
The floods also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and according to the report, the police are going through surveillance videos.
Another victim of the shooting in the city this week was a 6-year-old girl whose hand struck a snitch while playing Tuesday in front of her home in West Oak Lane.
The girl is recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby, and Lauriet
With this name, I call the women's gymnastics Olympic team, and there are more than one reasons.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as strong as it is now.
Secondly, the three strengths of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of the team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
Finally, the team represents America.
It has also confirmed the visibility of black and Latino women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the best female rapist has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1st and 2nd.
This is great.
In the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas rose to become a chess surprise winner, and the whole of America hurrahed.
Now, the world has been able to witness the incredible achievements of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, and the amazing and masterful lifting programs.
Simon became the fourth consecutive American to win gold in the women's individual competition.
Teammate Aly Raisman won the silver.
The views are such at the top of the species, but at the same time do not appear to be felt by the peasants throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the last five (“Final Five”), as the next rowing team will have only four gymnasts, and this will be Marta Karoli’s final year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that scaffolding is an expensive sport and gymnasts practice mainly in private scaffolding gyms, which are maintained by their parents. The parents pay for the training costs, the facilities, the trips, the performance fees, the fees, the fees for the competition.
The premises of most forklift units are located in rich residential areas, which are able to support operations.
The teaching of the fortifications takes place in these associations, and it means an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of the fortifications.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both trained species enthusiasts since they started breeding.
We need to set up a more affordable and better available training for young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my own fortification foundation 20 years ago.
The Harlem-based organisations have offered free or affordable opportunities to recruit more than 15,000 urban youth (mostly blacks and Latin Americans), and some of these young people have won national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations to my hometown of Detroit, so that we can provide high-quality scaffolding for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic Games.
Strength training develops strength, inertia and coordination of the body and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lifetime sustainable benefits and supports good health and success in school and at work.
This team has aroused enthusiasm for thousands of young girls who now want to start sledding, and it is absolutely amazing.
Participation in some sports is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison for the real “girl power” you showed when you won the Olympic gold, and for motivating so many different young girls from their backgrounds to start their path to be prosperous, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors reject Jeremy Hunt’s proposal and prepare for new cuts
The Ministers hoped to decide on a dispute over changes in remuneration and working conditions by approving the revised agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but with a vote of 37,000 junior doctors, or 58 specialist doctors, who participated in the vote.
Health Minister Hunt said in July plans to get the deal in advance and said the UK's public health system (NHS) was "no one's land" and that any additional delays were detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement, which includes changes to the practices of night and weekend work, in order to improve health care at non-social times.
Last night, Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Junior Medical Committee, delivered an opinion in which she said: "Junior doctors are still very much looking forward to the proposed agreement, particularly the fear that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that not all the workers will be affected.
There are only eight weeks until the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so now we have to move on, because time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by talking, but the government has been reluctant to engage in discussions and sometimes not even reacting in any way.
Even so, Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, cancel the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors are ready for new work-related measures."
At the end of April, the previous strike delayed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 reception times when caregivers and consultative doctors were asked to support the strike guards.
The ministers hoped to resolve the dispute over the changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the officials of the trade union representing British doctors.
The BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 junior doctors who would be affected by the contract.
The head of NHS staff, Daniel Mortimer, urged junior doctors not to take any new steps.
Mortimer says: “Working activities achieve very little or nothing, but they create pressure for teams and services already operating at the border and cause worry, distress and disruption to patients, the care staff and their families.
Over the past two months, we have been in negotiations with the Junior Medical Committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and other bodies, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisor and the disclosure of defects.
The workers were hopeful that the continuing positive commitment to other important subjects of health care, such as development, flexibility in education, additional education, training costs, mutual recognition of the educational programme, free education, and gender equality was a key element in health care.
A medicine that costs around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.40 a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are getting access to a drug that costs around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.40 a day, when the authorities recommended that it be given to more people and for longer-term use.
The anticonvulsant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The drug is already being given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or a new heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which is part of the UK’s Public Health System (NHS), has instructed that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to reduce the risk of heart and blood clots in the blood vessels.
But now the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which is part of the UK’s public health system (NHS) and is evaluating the introduction of new treatments, has instructed that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to treat heartburn and diarrhoea.
In England, about 140,000 people get a heart attack each year, of which one-quarter are relapsed or they get a stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is a fat substance that accumulates in the walls of blood vessels, which creates plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it can create a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the clot is released, it can travel along the bloodstream and prevent blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new episode is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
The ticagrelor produced by British AstraZeneca, which is sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of tulips.
The draft guideline for NICE, published today, recommends that ticagrelor be administered for the next 90 mg for 12 months, after which the dose is reduced to 60 milligrams and aspirin is also given twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, of the Center for the Evaluation of the Initiation of Treatment Methods, said: “Although effective methods of treatment are available to prevent the progression of the disease and the onset of symptoms, up to a quarter of those who have had a heart attack will have a new stroke or stroke.
The fear of regeneration can have a very negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
We have found that ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it.”
Since the data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular for the risk of bleeding, are limited if it is used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend the use of the treatment method for a longer period.
Due to the political correctness of the electoral climate, the ballot box in Muslim regions flourished
Lutfur Rahman, a former mayor of Tower Hamlets, resigned last year because of corruption, resulting in a report by the government.
A climate of political correctness has led to the close of the eyes of widespread voter turnout in Muslim communities, revealing the government’s report published today.
The government’s former minister, Sir Eric Pickles, severely criticized police, election observers, and city authorities for having closed their eyes from the ballot box “for their hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
According to Pickles, known as the former regional government minister and as the current anti-corruption power chief, the fear of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form guard chains outside the polling stations so that the voters could have won.
He suggests that voters should present a certificate of identity in order to be able to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter only has to state his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to dip your fingers into a non-departmental ink after voting, so that no one can vote twice.
"We need to protect the whistleblowers more," said Sir Eric.
He calls for improved access for journalists to the documents of the Council of State and decisions of informal committees and working groups.
“The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat fraud and economic interests, and the culture that favours them more broadly in local governments,” he says.
The British prime minister asked for a report after the East London Tower Hamlet voting scandal.
Last year, the special Electoral Court ruled that the then mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should resign due to corruption and numerous illegal procedures.
The court found that Rahman “stupidly misrepresented” his Muslim community’s religious sentiment and silenced his critic by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was said to be "the basis of his campaign that every Muslim who believes in religion was obliged to vote for him."
Of the 300 votes cast, up to 300 were questioned or falsely given so that a person voted by pretending to be someone else.
Sir Eric said evidence of the mole was obtained from all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the postival scandal in which members of the Muslim community were told to pressure people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (pictured) made a number of proposals to clean up the voting system, including requiring a certificate of identity at the polling station.
The report says: "There has been evidence that some members of ethnic minority groups in vulnerable positions, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the wishes of their parents, especially in the Pakistan and Bangladesh-backed communities."
"I was concerned that... the state institutions had closed their eyes to such activity because of 'politically correct' ethnicity and hypersensitivity to religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning the processing of postal ballots from political activists, in order to prevent "vote collection".
The report currently under consideration by Theresa May also calls for closer scrutiny of the registration in order to prevent the use of the register of voting rights in immigration and preferential fraud.
Consideration of options where voters would be required to present an identity card before the vote is taken.
Tossing your fingers in the non-deleted ink after voting, so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and the right to vote of voters.
Setting a three-year limit on requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibiting the processing of voicemails and voicemail messages sent by filled-in mail from political activists.
The right of the police to form security chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the Act to make it easier to raise claims of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act of 1983 on Enlargement of Voting Rights.
Prohibiting photography at polling stations.
Only allow English at polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthening training in order to ensure a staff-supervised rule that only one person is allowed to go to the voting booth at a time.
Sir Eric harshly criticizes the London police and considers it "surprising" that no criminal charges were raised after the Tower Hamlet case.
“The Electoral Court has dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative from office for corruption and numerous illegal practices,” he said.
"They were found guilty without a reasonable doubt, and the criminal record was overstated on many grounds."
He also criticized the ineffective "restraint checks" of the departments responsible for the city council's electoral lists.
“The court’s decision last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call,” says Sir Eric.
“Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by some people’s worrying and covert campaigning and its ban.”
The Olympic cyclist’s resemblance to the Duchess Catherine and the other doubles will go wild at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games were drawn to the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is astonishing.
But according to social media, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for the championship, who has a chance to compete with a well-known person.
In honor of Rio’s kites and all the famous faces on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all the Olympic athletes whose similarities with Hollywood audiences are evident.
Hunter and Wolf: The U.S. men’s springboard team, Brady Ellison (b.) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the double presence of Catherine, who is seen on bicycle tours, many people have noted on social media how one of the hippies could be the actor's favorite twin brother, Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a U.S. men’s basketball team, caused a storm on Twitter after images of him in which he horrendously resembles the star of the Wolf of Wall Street movie.
Ellison was aware of the social media hype and admitted to hearing from a child that he resembled DiCaprio.
“I don’t see the similarity as great, maybe except for the beard and the wig,” Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a courtesy."
At the 2012 London Olympics, British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were teased about the similarity, which is undoubtedly brought out even more in these races.
The large-eyed and expressive Russian performer Aliya Mustafina has been dubbed the double-dose by the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
On the other hand, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghi has been compared to Matthew Morrison, known for years as the Glee television series.
This user says Nathan Adrian is an "athletic version" of the actor in the Inception film.
Similarly, for a long time, the similarity between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett has been noted, highlighted by both strong eyebrows and lips.
Swimming silver medalist Yulia Efimova reminds actress Annalynne McCord, and not only beautifully because of her browned skin and pale hair, while US team Nathan Adrian is according to her fans "the athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitti".
These two iron women, football star Hope Solo (d.) and Dexter series actor Jennifer Carpenter (d.), resemble each other in their faces and eyes.
Not only: this Twitter user was delighted when others also saw the similarity.
This user is wondering if there is a good reason for the pair’s similarity.
One tweeter recently expressed joy when “others on the internet agree on the similarity between Hope Solon and Jennifer Carpenter.”
The American football star and the actor in the Dexter series really do look like each other in their faces and eyes.
Many have also noticed the similarity in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney, and the gold-winning enforcer Gabby Douglas and Anna Back!, in the wide smiles of Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic Commentator Apologizes for Saying Chinese Swimmer ‘Dead as a Pig’
Byron MacDonalds’ analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s fourth in a women’s 4<0xC3><0x97>200-meter release message stunned viewers at the CBC’s live Olympics on Wednesday.
Canadian radio company CBC has been forced to apologise after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “lost his smell” and “dead like a pig” during the race.
Detective Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started pitching his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200 metre release message finale.
MacDonald, who was taken to CBC's coloring team, was heard to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, left in a hurry and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, was swimming during the second part of the message 1:57.79, and left 1.61 seconds of Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canadians to swim to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly after being shocked by the commentator’s tone and language use.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC whistleblower just say that a 14-year-old Chinese sailor died like a pig???
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the mission."
In the final of the women's 4 x 200 metre release message, Ai Yanhani, a Chinese swimmer, was described by the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter quickly filled with angry comments by Byron MacDonald, and many demanded his resignation.
The Witnesses did not keep their words when they heard how ruthless Byron Macdonald was.
Witness Sarah Paradis wrote: “Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist gang.
CBC hosts Scott Russell quickly apologized for MacDonald's remarks: "We apologize for the comment made on the swim performance.
It was a regrettable choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened."
CBC eventually had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Scott Russell, a fellow commentator, had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald.
After that, the CBC copied and added its regrets to over 90 other tweeters’ comments complaining about MacDonald’s speech.
The TV company also quickly filed a public apology.
“We are very sorry about these statements and the fact that they were sent.
In yesterday’s broadcast, we quickly apologized to our viewers, and we also made an apology to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him personally.
Despite this, they were inappropriate and the choice of words had to be regretted, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday evening, MacDonald expressed his regret at the broadcast and tried to defend his speech by saying that he did not mean it personally.
"I want to apologize for my comment I made last night after the women's message," MacDonald said in a statement at the CBC Olympic Games.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer, not the person.
Needless to say, I didn’t mean anything derogatory in my words, and I’m very sorry.”
In Primark, a woman who agreed to stop underwear in the middle of the trade shocked customers
Customers didn’t know where to look when the woman got up in the middle of Primark to fit underpants.
He further aggravated the situation by assessing what he looked like in the underpants, taking them off his feet and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and eventually tried out four pair of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
A Primark chain store in Folkeston’s Bouverie Place shopping centre, where a woman tried underwear for everyone and put them back on the shelf
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children, says that after trying underwear, an unknown woman dressed up and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He says, “People didn’t believe their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the shop, took her underwear off the shelf, stripped her own jerseys and underwear and put them on.
He didn’t try to do it inconsiderately, but he did it without shame.
Everyone looked when he took off his underpants and apparently didn’t like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding that he didn’t like them, dressed up and walked out.
He didn’t seem to care about the looks – and didn’t think of the person who would eventually buy the underwear he had reached.”
The 33-year-old, who lives in Kent Town, continues: “How ridiculous to think that someone takes home underwear that someone else has worn and hasn’t washed.”
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
“I understand that the sales staff was trying to remove those pieces of clothing from the sale when the woman had left – which is right.
It would be terrible to take new underwear home and notice that someone else has reached them without them being washed afterwards,” Davidson added.
Primark's spokesman said: "Primark is aware of the situation in the Folkeston movement on Tuesday, 9 August.
All of these products have been removed from sale.”
This is how you defend yourself against an armed attack with the help of Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Rhon Mizrach, Grand Master of the Krav Maga League in New York, and we asked for advice on how to survive being a close-knit thief or criminal.
The video will show you how to defend yourself against an attacker, depending on whether the attacker approaches you in front of or behind you.
If the attacker approaches the back, the first thing you need to do is turn around to see the attacker and get out of the firing line, says Mizrachi.
After this, hold the weapon so that it stays between your elbow and shoulder, and hit the attacker on the face with your free elbow.
Then cut the assailant to his knees, and when he goes through the pain twice, pass him to his face with the barrel of a gun and retreat by holding the weapon directed at him.
The technique is the same if the armed attacker approaches the front. You have to move away from the firing line, get into the weapon and rotate it so that the attacker cannot fire.
At the same time, place your weight on your weapon and hit the attacker with your wrist on his chest. Turn the weapon away from the attacker’s grip, turn back, and hold the weapon aimed at the attacker.
Does it sound difficult?
Watch the video on how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that it is safer to get rid of the thief by handing over your cash – unless you are the master of Krav Maga.
Ian Wright, a world traveler, takes to Europe’s dirtiest places
The British world traveler put his resistance and comedic reflexes to the test by squeezing Europe’s dirtiest and most hostile places.
Ian Wright, 51, a suffocated suffragist and travel guide writer, wanted to prove his resilience by squeezing euro banknotes, hand gestures at the Piccadilly Circus, the train’s flushing button, and the Russian public phone.
Before shaving, Wright measured the objects with a snow gauge to see for himself and to show the viewers what was in his tongue pushing.
The experiment was made with Ian Wright – The Traces of Inner Power, and its results were surprising.
The idea of rinsing the train toilet flush button can be daunting, but in fact, more bacteria are in the kitchen countertops.
On her journey across Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals about strengthening the gut’s good bacteria and about her own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he chewed caused nothing but a mouthful of nausea.
In the beginning, Ian Wright became known for his travel program, where he tested the sustainability of his guts by traveling around the world and eating weird and amazing things.
Unquestionably, the squeezing of the railway station’s handicrafts and the flushing of the toilet button challenged Wright’s resistance.
Wright says in the document: “I’ve been pretty worried about my health since I was a child and I’ve put my mouth in all sorts of things, like soil, worms, and cockroaches.”
In the film, he really showed his reputation as a tax collector.
The border came against only in a bustling public toilet in Russia.
The snow gauge measured more than 4000 units from the sample.
For comparison, let’s say that the number of hands in the wash is usually less than 60.
The border came against the Russian public toilet, where Wright refused to shave when the snow gauge measured 4,000 units, with the same number in the corresponding hands being less than 60.
In the documentary film produced with Valio, Wright explores the traces of Inner Power, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document: "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
There's nothing more dirty than that!
The place has to be so picturesque that I don’t really paint anything here.”
Wright produced the documentary film Ian Wright – The Traces of Inner Power in collaboration with Valio.
Wright was selected to receive milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and vitamin D from Valio Gefilus, which helps to strengthen the gut’s good bacteria and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s interim, juice and new products category manager, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and eventually we ended up thinking about asking with Ia."
The health of the intestine has become a global trend.
“Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and tell them about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
The health of the intestine has become a global trend, and with the help of the document, we can provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The movie also tells us about our sense of humor.”
Tom Hakala added: “It is said that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had stolen certain items we asked for, such as the Russian toilet depicted, which is also shown in the film.
Of course, some items were easier for Ian, while some of them were quite bad.
I’m glad we got some of the dirty stains described on the tape.”
In a poll conducted in 2015, 84 per cent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria in particular to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent reported using at least occasionally products that have been added to lactic acid bacteria.
Before his marriage, the groom's family destroyed a town-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall.
The H<0xC3><0xA4>irik<0xC3><0xB6>k<0xC3><0xB6> family left behind the damage of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 to the town's rented house after they got married because of the neighborhood's terrorism.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been given a divorce from their apartment in Cornwall's Saltash following complaints against numerous couples.
When the couple was forcibly removed from the apartment, the representatives of the rental housing company found that the apartment was in a state of shock.
The walls had holes to shoot, the floorboards had been torn apart, the debris had been spread to the floors and the walls had been plastered with graffiti.
The couple has now changed, and they are believed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says she's afraid the apartment may no longer be salvaged.
He says: “This has been a complete nightmare for the people living here, no one should have to suffer like this.
There is a lot to weigh in on, as the property is likely to become known as a not so pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, as is its name.”
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, the family’s terrible practice included street fights with baseball clubs, the fear of close-knit people, drug use and mediation, and loud screaming, fighting and cursing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease, received a decree on non-social behaviour.
Several of the rooms in the house below the Purku-uha were found old waste.
Drugs had previously been sold from the house, and floor paintings had been torn off.
According to the neighbors, the family fought on the street and the police had to call the place regularly.
Cornwall’s housing agency canceled the couple’s forced marriage this week, giving them an additional 11 weeks to move out voluntarily for the first time.
Effortless neighbors were grateful for the marriage —they said their life was hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We have lived in their neighborhood for 20 years, and all that time has been difficult.
“The police have been here an incredible number of times.”
“We didn’t get any sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet, and we're not used to it!
It’s going to be wonderful now that they’re finally getting married.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Agency’s mandatory practice, says the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly called to the place.
The trash and old toys were thrown on the wall of the rented house.
Fitzpatrick adds: “It’s a pity that the tenant didn’t take any responsibility for his or her own and family’s behavior, because the cancellation is always the last measure that the Cornwall Housing Agency is considering.
This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be shocking to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working group, the Devon and Cornwall police and the members of the community who took part in the work and courageously offered to provide us with information.
I hope that this step will improve the well-being of our neighbours and give a message that non-social behaviour is not acceptable."
Fitzpatrick says that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their twenties.
The dirty bed found in the house from one bedroom after the wedding
Housing workers now have to clean up the wastes surrounding the house.
Police raided the apartment in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabinoids, as well as vases and other accessories, as well as 1,700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon received a fine when he was found guilty of possession of Class B drug for the purpose of selling it.
He claimed the money was for his son Lee Skeldon's tombstone in a car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and her husband are rumored to have moved to a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were decorated with graffiti.
Police say they demand a divorce from tenants who violate the rules of the leases.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police say this act is a clear warning to tenants who are constantly breaking the rules.
“This is a clear message to those who think they can behave the way they want without accusations, as well as to those who suffer from such behavior,” Crow says.
The Devon and Cornwall Police will never accept criminal and non-social behaviour, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-flying, beach hippos army shower machine scared tourists in Portugal
The sun-worshippers experienced a shock of their lives in Portugal's Aviros.
The P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force crashed to a shocking low.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten security.
The picture shows a moment when tourists were forced to flee when a low-flying shower machine crashed over the entire beach.
Dramatic images show how an army aircraft comes close to contact distance on a sandy beach from the sun-drenched tourists in Northern Portugal's Aveiros.
The holidaymakers got up on their feet, worrying understandably about the jetty of the shower engine, which began to sound before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the vacationers who photographed and posted videos of dramatic pastimes on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says: “It crossed the beach twice at a really low level, and there was a moment when it looked like it was falling to the ground.”
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure that the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at a shocking low.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify the coastal fishing vessels, which was why the aircraft had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly slightly lower than normal, because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires damaged visibility, but according to the air force, this did not threaten anyone’s safety.
Forest fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that due to the poor visibility caused by the fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight, during which the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
The results of the first half of the year are expected to be better
The Social and Health District of South Karelia (Eksote) made a better result in January - in June, EUR 3.4 million.
The result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to break down plant care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Exote aims to shorten the lines of action.
Exote covers the surplus by exceeding the previously generated deficit.
The remaining portion may be used to reduce edema and purchase measures for patients.
The result of the whole year is expected to be 4.6 million euros better than planned.
The Eksote government will discuss the half-year review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Guards Sworn to Immolas Soldier
The 70 crew members of the Border and Coast Guard School were sworn in as soldiers on Friday.
The military meeting of the border and naval school’s armed forces was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Cross-Border Course was held in the sports field of the team.
The soldier was sworn in by 70 crew members.
Special border guards are trained in demanding border security, intelligence, and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for a special border doctor.
250 of them were invited to the elections.
Special border guards have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veteran meeting, which took place in connection with the election, was attended by five veterans of the border forces during the war.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years old.
The oldest veterans to take part in the event were born in 1918.
A bit of rubbish above - a criminal investigation to help solve crimes and expose serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 police stations in Finland has operated an RTA, a crime investigation and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
The H<0xC3><0xA4>me police station comprises a total of four police officers in Lahti and H<0xC3><0xA4>meenlinna.
It's drawn by the superintendent in Lahti.
Commissioner Lahti is the Chief of Staff.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in H<0xC3><0xA4>meenlinna.
They all work in the civil service.
The unit has demonstrated its usability and necessity, according to Assistant Police Chief Tero Sepp<0xC3><0xA4>nen.
The RTA unit will produce a variety of reports to other police.
It has, among other things, gained information about asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crimes, i.e., the fact that the police were more and more rarely leaving the pills on the spot only after receiving an alert.
The information collected and analysed by the unit will focus on the day-to-day police activities where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one crime investigation centre was established in the country, under it three national units and each police station its own crime investigation unit.
The PTR Centre, which operates in Vantaa in the context of the Central Crime Police, operates nationally.
In PTR units, people from the Police, Customs and Border Patrol work in accordance with their name.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas that are divided according to the police authorities, and their task is to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
The investigation extends beyond its own territory.
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour workweek, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is going on throughout the police station.
The investigation also extends beyond the limits of its own institution, because it does so in a criminal way.
Those working in the RTA unit have better skills in the basic policies.
The unit seeks to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, product-related crimes or similar crimes, using registers, alert task data and observations.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal prosecution.
Everyone has their own way of acting.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on what you do, a certain image is created.
Sorting can be done on the basis of either the perpetrator or the person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
Workers of the RTA unit do not ride the city rails upright, but their work is not completely public.
Neither the own nor the methods used by criminals are explained, as this could lead to the professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent the crime prevention companies of the police.
The police will inform the public about the methods if it foresees the threat to them.
Such a case had, for example, been updated from the beginning of the year, the marking of empty dwellings used in residential demolitions.
It’s where the actors put a fork, buttonhole, or tapestries on the outside of the apartment, trying to see if the residents are really on the go.
The presentation material shall be made public to at least the parties concerned.
The unit of analysis has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
For example, you may find that fingerprints have been found on the site, and you can order a copyrighted protocol.
Next time, we’re going to steal our clothes.
Deputy Police Chief Tero Sepp<0xC3><0xA4> from H<0xC3><0xA4>meen Police, Commissioner Tuomo Lepoloa from Eastern Finland Police, Commissioner Sami Joutj<0xC3><0xA4>rve from Joensuu Police Station and Inspector Arto Tuomela from Central Finland Police.
The police will collect and analyse information that will allow them to plan practical activities.
In the background, the amount of labour and finance will decrease.
The first steps towards a new way of doing things were already taken 30 years ago.
The last change was a three-stage PARA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation will collect information from outside of your own institution and the borders of Finland.
A London schoolgirl who joined her parents was killed in Syria
One of the three British students who joined Isis last year, Kadiza Sultana, has died in Syria.
Tasname Akunjee, a lawyer, told the girl’s family that Sultana had died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in the Russian airstrike Raqqa, which is ISIS’s base in Syria, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17, and her family said she was planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
“It can only be hoped that this will act as a warning example and testament so that people will understand that this is a real risk when going to the war zone – and that causes people to abandon their decision to leave,” says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana, along with two other East Turkic schoolgirls, boarded a plane flying to Turkey and continued their journey by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and remained widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid Says Clinton Supports Garland's Appointment to the Supreme Court If He's Elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he’s convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland’s Supreme Court justice if elected president.
Senate Republicans have not agreed to confirm Garland’s appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president will elect a person to fill the seat of former Supreme Court Justice Anton Scalia.
Reid said in a phone call on Thursday that he was predicting Clinton’s choice of Garland “very much with certainty.”
Reid's informant later clarified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton, whether or not he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton’s team would not want to “swim the boat” by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid says Republicans who prevent Garland’s nomination are “commanders” and “helpers” of President Donald Trump.
Trump doesn’t agree with the job.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars are as good for women as they are for men.
The Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere and brings to the market a 1970s-style calendar inspired by Pirelli for 2017.
Instead of public secrecy models, they want to find the top models of the next generation in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his obscurity-sighted newspaper is different from the old-school Playboy newspaper, as he said: "Playboy is for men.
I do this for women.”
He seems to be thinking about the calendar as well.
“We need to bring back a timeless and classic nudity where women, wherever men are, can effortlessly enjoy these stunning images of women and be inspired by them,” Shaw said in a statement.
“Women will definitely want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art.”
You can send your photos online or take part in open selections in Los Angeles and New York, for example.
Vinyl attraction: who buys the records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write a comment on the section of your angry objection under the name NoAllSingle Middle-aged Men, this statement is based on real research data.
According to YouGov, there is not a millennial-generation boom behind the arrival of new vinyl records, when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead a middle-aged nostalgia.
The age of the person who recently purchased the vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, those in the age group 18-24 are the least likely buyers.
It’s also not just about the desire of hobbyists to wave discs, but about the importance of sentiment: older vinyl buyers are a little more likely to hide their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do you think youGov's results are correct?
If this blog were a televised newscast, the camera would follow me as I walk along the busy Soho Street, a gold-plated grey jacket on my head. I would breathe loudly, bend my hands over a cup and say something traditional, like, "Let's get it right."
So let's get this straight.
Although Soho has slowly lost its appeal and ugliness when the hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over before the private Entrepreneur-owned premises, there are still a handful of specialty record stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I look very close to the men visiting these stores and try to evaluate their age and character.
Glasgow-based Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (at the moment by two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (at the moment by eight middle-aged men, one probably by twenty-five years old at the time)
I wonder if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
"I have about 3,000-4,000 records."
These plates fill his living room wall, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me the picture by e-mail, I did not follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles, is partly due to his available income. He is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they first appeared, and to buy again things that he was young and moneyless had to sell.
“I did a lot of things in the late 60’s and early 70’s that came up when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to get them,” he says.
He agrees that buying vinyl records is more likely to be introverts who have fun with their own company, and adds: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink very much.
It's my worst."
Wez, 25, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new kind of human flow that has been influenced by media hype. These people have heard about the coming of vinyl records again and now feel compelled to buy their old records back.
“Based on the discussions I held, people generally gave up their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyl back,” he says.
This may explain a certain age-old vinyl-based boom.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the soundtracks?
In just a few seconds, in a movement like Phoneca, you realize that they offer a comfortable community for like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have become particularly upset about the contactless payment system.
The digital world may haunt some of the vinyl fans, for whom returning to the well-known album cases means persistence and reminds of the happy days of youth.
“I think that sometimes it fills some hole or material property is acquired as some kind of consolation,” says Wez.
“I saw it as a collector myself, and I believe that so do many others.
It’s an easy way to get ideas elsewhere.”
"We're like social workers!" shouts Wez's colleague behind the plate.
A April ICM poll revealed that almost 50% of those who bought the vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their records.
The survey also found that 41 percent have a record player that they never use, and 7 percent of vinyl record buyers don’t have their own record player.
At this stage of the newscast, I would probably look like a serious face while browsing the stacked bossa nova collections.
The new arrival of vinyl records is also associated with a “pocalyptic phenomenon” that has been observed by the salesman of the Sounds of the Universe (at the moment, three middle-aged men) Jonny, 42.
“A customer recently came in and said he doesn’t have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead record so he can put it on his shelf,” Jonny says.
“The number of such customers is not high, but there are.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our customers say they don’t have a record player yet.
They’re younger, not older, mostly teenagers, who are just starting to get excited.”
The customer experience is much more varied in Fopp, where I will be next. The movement has dedicated a whole layer to vinyl records.
The customers are seventy couples, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers delights, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous movements: instead of the buzzing buzzing jazz, Wild Beasts’ newest sex-shy synthesizer pop.
None of the customers seem particularly lonely, but the psychological trauma of the film is difficult to detect by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppa for a few minutes and watching various discs at a discount.
He’s looking at things rather than making purchases.
He says his income is small, so collecting records is not possible for him.
“They cost a lot.
Music is easy to listen to from a computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the wine is ...", he lets his beloved snort and goes on:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who would think of jumping jeans, but instead of gathering around Polaroid cameras for a moment, I see a father and a daughter who were thinking about buying a Crosley disc player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac discs: a mix of contemporary music and classics, central discs in any of the mid-range collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they are just an element of decor and part of it so high that it is not even surpassed.
They are made of pure art vinyl furniture.
But considering that all the ways to get attention to these records may mean more money to the industry and send a few customers to search for Soho, there’s hardly a reason to complain.
It’s no surprise that a group of people who are most likely to have more time and money than most are also the group that spends the most money on luxury items, such as vinyl records.
Although, based on my research, YouGov’s results are true, at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not, however, exclude the large number of female and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be stuck closely in school or at work.
They certainly won’t spend their Thursday mornings at the Berwick Street record stores, browsing records, and avoiding the 30-year-old TV presenter, who looks horrendously and stares at the ill-fated middle-aged men.
Holkeri, or ice shark, is the longest-lived spinal cord – video report
According to the researchers, the longest living spinal cord on Earth is an ice shark.
According to the researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice age was found in the study 272-512 years, which was a woman of five meters in length.
French Court Rejects Application for Disposal of Forest Camp Shops
The French court has rejected an application by the Calais authorities demanding the demolition of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants by thousands of refugees living in a jungle camp.
At the hearing this week, the Calais authorities made a statement that the state should be allowed to break down 72 temporary shops set up for refugee camps. The shops sell to the residents of the refugee camp a variety of goods ranging from tobacco to energy drinks and other dishes offered by the state.
According to the Calais Prefectural Authorities, these shops and restaurants must be demolished because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and because they involve fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants are necessary for the camps, as the free meals offered by the state-supported organisation and other bodies are not enough for the growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often offer protection and free food to those in need.
The court ruled that the expulsion of the 72 temporary merchants was not a legal basis, but considered Calais’s prefect’s concern “completely understandable.”
According to Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Mollan, the camp’s food shops, cafes and restaurants are much more important than just providing food to people who “live in extremely unstable conditions.”
He says that they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteer workers can meet each other.
One of the places below the drop-off zone was the Jungle Book Kids Cafe at Camp, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and shelter advice for hundreds of campers without a caregiver, whose status is most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed up for an address where a children’s café is required to be kept.
According to a letter to the Guardian, closing it “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.”
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after a sharp increase in the summer fire levels, the population of the camp has risen to a record high of more than 9,000.
The price of food in Finland is falling much faster than in the EU on average
In Finland, food is cheap for the pleasure of consumers and for the harm of producers.
The price of food in Finland has dropped by almost five per cent in three years, with the average price in EU countries dropping by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one per cent more expensive.
In the last three years, the price of food has fallen to the second most in the EU countries with the same level of wages as in Finland.
In the UK alone, the price of food has dropped faster than in Finland.
The data will be published by Statistics Finland’s Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen in a paper published in the Tieto & Trendit blog.
The magazine compared real prices, i.e. prices that are relative to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices rose close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price interest that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen says.
Then followed the turn, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
The price is now under pressure from the Russian food import bans, which have disrupted food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
“Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
The tightening price competition between industry and trade has also affected the price drop.
The S-Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been seen as a visible advertising campaign.
However, Finland is still not a fan of affordable food, although the price of food has fallen a lot.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive EU country in Finland, with a similar wage level to that in Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food sold in Finland has a significant impact on value added tax.
He found that if the benchmark had the same value added tax rate, Finland would sell the third-cheapest food from the same countries.
The magazine compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the value added tax rate were seven in the comparison countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
“If we want to get to the level of the old EU countries at the price of food, the value added tax must be halved to the middle level of the EU countries and continue the price competition,” Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen notes that the calculations he made with the VAT rate are indicative.
The school is no longer the same.
You may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all sub-schools.
This is a guide that will be delivered to all schools in Finland.
Schools decide for themselves the details, but the plan tells the official objectives.
New instructions have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old instructions in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of fine writing is abandoned, and instead, coding is practiced in schools.
Swedish education begins in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies are started in the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
Before it was thought that the teacher was teaching students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
In this way, school attendance is trying to make it more interesting.
World's longest-lived spinal cord found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
The coldest known Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches sexual maturity only at the age of 150.
It may live another 250 years, according to a new study.
The figures make the species the oldest spine in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by an Icelandic doll, whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507 years old.
The Greenlandic haze extends along the North Atlantic.
They also have a second record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch dogs longer, they can grow to more than five meters.
Because the growth rate is slow, according to the surveys only about a centimeter per year, the adult individuals have been living for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen, from the University of Copenhagen, took note of his colleagues.
He identified two of the 28 women in adult ice sheets who had been left to fish.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon restriction of the lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish, 493 and 502 centimetres of amazon, were found to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Because previous studies have found that ice-cream cones reach sexual maturity at just over a quarter of a metre, the researchers calculated that they were about 150 years old at the time.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired at nearly 300 - sales are not reduced
Nearly 300 employees are dismissed from the warehouse company Stockmann.
In the event of difficulties, the joint ventures ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 jobs will be reduced, the majority of which will be carried out as redundancies," Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of sellers of warehouses will not be reduced in order to avoid suffering from customer service.
In addition, about 80 support services workers are offered a new job as a salesman.
Stockmann's core negotiations involved some 3,000 employees.
At the beginning of this period, it was estimated that there were around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population is aimed at an annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are to be realized over the next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme with the aim of saving <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million this year.
There are Stockmann's difficulties in getting profitable from the store.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating profit improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the retail trade is still losing.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, Managing Director of Stockmann, sales in warehouses have not met the objectives set by the company.
"Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail has a positive business result in 2018," Veijalainen said in a statement.
On the basis of the second quarter’s performance improvement, Lindex’s clothing chain was particularly successful.
The chain achieved its best sales and results in the second quarter of all time.
Lindex’s operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s operating profit was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s turnover this year will shrink from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be somewhat positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - the temperature is below 20 degrees all over the country
The low-pressure center on the northern part of Finland will hold the weather on a rainy Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona L<0xC3><0xA1>ng.
There will also be rain showers in the central part of the country, but the southern part is muddy.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury stays below 20 degrees throughout the country.
In the northern wetlands it is 10-15 degrees.
Kenya’s general sports team is concerned about the doping scandal – a strange explanation for the coach’s temperament
Kenyan general sport coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete in the doping test.
The AP news agency reported that the athlete in which Anzrah tried to perform is 800 meters star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arab Soi, a Kenyan national team leader, said that Anzrah’s identity was revealed after he had given the Rotichin sample in a surprise test.
Doping officials went to the Anzrah authorities to report it.
Anzrah was sent home, he said, because he "made his crime against the Kenyan national team".
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour,” Kip Keino, the chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, told Reuters.
The Olympic general sport starts on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich placed fourth in last year’s World Cup and is ahead of Rio’s winning favourites.
According to Reuters, a source within the Kenyan general sports team claimed that Anzrah only ran the athlete’s accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials confronted him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid to reveal himself,” the source said.
Where's everybody?
Rio's Sports Stadium Is Empty
Where is everything right?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium to follow the general sport.
In Rio on Friday, a battle on the dimensions of public sports began, but the world’s elites were able to present their skills to the naked eye.
Rio organizers said on Friday that only 58 percent of the first day’s morning evening tickets and 65 percent of the evening’s evening tickets have been sold.
Another was four years ago in London, where the stadium was littered with a ferocious crowd.
Tickets for the finals have already been sold out in Rio.
Rio’s Olympic spectators have already attracted attention before the general sport.
For example, spectators of rugby, melon and horseback riding have seen thousands of empty benches.
When Brazil’s medalists Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the stadium was filled with spectators.
After the Brazilian boxing match, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 per cent of the 12,000 people watched.
Poor runners explain, at least, that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian racing enthusiasts, and many of the Olympic games are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not get the stadium to be filled with water.
Mario Andrada, a whistleblower’s spokesman, said on weekends that 82 percent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
“There are still 1.1 million remaining for sale,” Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million Olympic flags in London, 8.2 million were sold, although the flags cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 to over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 for those who opened.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
Volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats at the London Olympics, but this has not yet been allowed in Rio, as organizers need money and are trying to get tickets to sell until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organizers have given 240,000 tickets to less well-known species, such as golf and rugby, to schoolchildren in the country.
There were plenty of empty seats in Rio’s stadium in the morning.
Even the beach volleyball in the Copacabana sand has no interest in the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
Enough with the magazines.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation in the latest ways.
The foundation, which was founded last year, acquires ecologically important natural areas for its ownership.
After that, private individuals, businesses and communities can redeem with money holding rights to the territory.
The foundation has acquired its first land area from Lapland.
The land area is divided virtually into blocks that you want to be able to acquire for a royalty payment.
The holder receives a veto right of 187 square blocks, which in practice means that no approval is required from each holder if the land use purpose is to be changed.
Administrative rights can also be acquired for several blocks.
The acquisition of administrative rights is something concrete that can be left as a legacy or given as a gift.
You don’t have to go to carry banners or hang yourself somewhere to protect nature,” says Juha Levi<0xC3><0xA4>kangas, who acquired the rights to his company.
The administrative authority acquires precise location information from its block, which allows, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the name data of the holders of the rights are compiled in the same map from which the block data of the territory can be found.
Lev<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>kanas sees its acquisition of natural protection as a risk only that the Foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a charitable foundation with the aim of promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation will act somewhat unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Haltija project is to protect natural areas so that they can be untouched and peaceful.
The foundation acquires land areas either by purchase or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly with the sale of holding rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more countries of protection.
It also targets outside Finland’s borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Trade Fair on August 13-19.
Bike sheds torment large cities with the worst in Turku - see your home town situation
Bicycle helmets are the worst in Finland’s major cities.
This year, there have been more rounds stolen compared to the number of inhabitants than in nine other major cities.
Based on the bicycle thefts reported to the police, Helsinki’s Sanomat found out the proportion of bicycles stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August of this year and their parts per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to the market, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti also peaked.
According to the police, there were four to five bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, in Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
That's the big difference.
“In other cities, there are double the number of robberies compared to others,” said Tommi Reen, a police inspector.
The police in the market are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
“The frequency of traffic can be influenced by how much traffic is on wheels in the city and how many wheels there are at all,” says Chief Executive Officer Teemu <0xC3><0x84>ik<0xC3><0xA4>s.
Tommi Reen, the police administration, expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top in comparison.
The number of bicycle shelters varies greatly depending on what are the cities of study and cycling.
The market has a tight center, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a very special city, where the city centres are far from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of transport,” Reen says.
In Finland, there have been slightly fewer round-the-clock robberies in January-August than in the same period last year.
There is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downturn in recent years, the police report little more than 20,000 bicycle thefts per year.
It means 50-60 fillers per day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 wheels per year.
"They're big numbers," Reen says.
In reality, thieves are more likely to take turns, as only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Ree urges people to make a criminal complaint about the theft of bicycles, although less than one in 10 reported cases to police will be resolved.
A typical discovered bicycle theft is one in which the police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught in the blood.
“There are also cases of other investigations where, for example, stolen wheels can be found in the apartment of a drug dealer,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, cyclists are arrested every week for their own crime or police investigation, says senior officer Timo Lepp<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>ki.
According to him, the wheels are stolen, for example, from the bicycle lines of the shopping malls, from the interior, from the warehouses and from the bicycle racks, i.e. practically everywhere where they are usually stored.
Most of the individual bicycle models are stolen, as in previous years, by Jopoja.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take the bike for example for short-term own use, but a large part of the stolen bikes end up on sale, for example, via the Internet.
They remain on the domestic market.
“At least the police have not been informed that the stolen wheels would almost go abroad,” Reen says.
According to police, buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
Part of buying a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful, as he may be guilty of a hidden crime or violation.
“Warning bells should ring if well-rounded wheels are sold clearly at a low price,” Reen says.
Special librarian Severi Hirvi always wears Nopsan in his colour during his working day to protect the Kallio library in Helsinki.
The wheel he has had five pieces, but none have been stolen, says Hirvi. "It has never been taken, so far there has been a good monk."
“Maybe this doesn’t attract thieves that much, it doesn’t necessarily have hipster value here,” says Hirvi, a Helsinki thinker.
At the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, Siiri Valve quickly closed its bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now the wheel stuck the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks its wheel to something fixed, such as a wheel tool.
“You have to think about it a lot, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own,” says a Helsinki student about his white bike, whose body alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time you hear from friends that the wheel has been taken."
"Especially bad wheels, those kind of r<0xC3><0xA2>m<0xC3><0xA2>-Jopoes."
The bike was stolen from the inside of the house a year ago.
The bike had not been locked, so Valve was waiting for it to start.
Under 15 years of age for crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with well-known U.S. paratroopers
In Helsinki, the so-called "comparison team" is being tried to prevent young people from getting into the crime scene.
Initially, the experiment is applied to those under the age of 15 who are now without criminal liability.
The comrade's team is missing the first young man to commit a crime.
The idea is that the comparator team will discuss the crime with the perpetrator and impose a sanction.
A week later, the perpetrator of the crime may join the Board of Directors to remediate his crime.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Youth Executive Director, says the model is not strict.
We also have other matching models, which are used in parallel.
“Everyone is guided in a more responsible direction so that everything doesn’t go to waste from the first mistake,” Laitio says.
A model from the United States, in which it is widely used, has been adopted by the Board of Supervisors.
The idea is that after the first crime, the young person does not get in front of the adult panel, but reflects what happened around them with the same age group.
The model has been tested once.
Iikka Lovio, the service design agency in Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that this was an abuse that was successfully solved.
In particular, the first crimes under the age of 15 years have not necessarily been dealt with at all before.
“It’s been a message to continue on the path you chose,” Lovio says.
Vertaisvalamish<0xC3><0xB6> is part of the Helsinki project for immigrant youth, which is supported by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new ways of working are being offered to everyone in need, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans Want the Party to Stop Funding Trump’s Campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, who had received it to see the draft.
According to the magazine, the open letter was addressed to the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party’s money to be directed to the congress halls instead of the Trump campaign.
“We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, his indifference, his incompetence, and his record-breaking dissatisfaction threaten to bring a turnaround in these elections to Democrats,” the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to the congressional halls can prevent Republicans from drowning in a Trump-themed anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, because Trump’s chances of winning the presidential elections are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is intended to be sent within the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizers of the letter is Andrew Weinstein, a Republican who is clearly opposed to Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress" and that it is not a matter of anyone's support.
The letter lists several of Donald Trump’s actions, believed to have injured millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working for national security said in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises to make it easier for U.S. families
In the United States, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, said she had details of her economic policy on Thursday evening.
I am trying to be president so that the US economy will do well for everyone.
“Donald Trump is trying to be president so that the economy goes well for him and his friends,” Clinton said in a speech.
At the heart of Clinton’s plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure – roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases on the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a handicraft for American dunas who suffer from factory relocation to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in high-paying jobs after World War II.
We're the builders, we need to get back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to make it easier for working families.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders, stressing that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the U.S. to become a taxpayer, it has to pay the starting tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
“As president, I’m against all trade agreements that work against workers or wages,” Clinton said.
According to speculations published prior to Clinton’s speech, Clinton was going to criticize the economic program announced by Republican Donald Trump on Monday that it “recommends only millionaires like this.”
Trump’s proposed tax cuts to corporate tax havens have previously been dubbed “Trump’s piggy bank.”
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded listeners of small business owners whose bills Trump has left unpaid, and of the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America,” Clinton said.
These are Rio’s viewer figures: The kites have not glued the Finns to the boxes, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually, sports competitions are shown on television as sharp peaks in the viewer's stats.
For the time being, the Rio Olympics have not reached a huge number of spectators.
At one time, the races have tied at their best 12 percent of the population: Tuesday night’s swim was followed by 615 000 spectators from the Ylen Olympic Channel on TV2 at the same time.
By comparison, the one-month-old European Championships in general sport were attended by almost 800,000 spectators at one time, and the second million European Championships in football.
So far, the most interested in the Olympics have been the Sunday-night cycling and the fifth day of the race, both of which reached almost half a million spectators on the Olympic channel at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, head of the sport, is pleased with the spectators’ performances, and recalls that the spectators will be divided into several different instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, the Finns will follow the Olympic Games in Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how much of the TV viewers choose the Olympics in general.
On the TV side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports games to which Yle has owned the entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are all the time from 20,000 to 500,000, then that’s a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly due to the time difference - a large part of Rio’s racing missions will be in Finland at night.
Another reason for the vague interest - if it is now considered a vague one - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken someone's surprise meter from the initials, the interest would have pumped up with it.
In addition, the general sport is only just beginning, as are other Finnish species of interest: sailing and horseback riding.
According to Pokkien, the number of spectators at the start was close to what was expected.
When the public sport begins, the audience figures explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for kits, which rose in the first days of the kits in the Apple App Store to become the most downloaded free app in Finland.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're already on 200,000 loading roads.
“We’ll only get the network viewer numbers later,” Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena has not worked well for all users.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has come and the errors have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been accompanied by a delay and other minor technical problems at the initial stage.
Updated versions of the applications have been received, which should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics will be shown on the Yle channel and arena more broadly than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can be followed by some species, and on the radio Yle Speech broadcasts the kites on a daily basis.
The Olympians are not only perhaps the most laborious to Yle ever, but also the last to be followed only by Yle channels.
From 2018 onwards, Olympic sport can be seen on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is P<0xC3><0xA4>ij<0xC3><0xA4>ne, which is 95.3 meters deep at Ristinsel<0xC3><0xA4>.
It could be even deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a 20-square-meter-threshold weight from Ristisel<0xC3><0xA4>, the depth of which was 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre tried to strengthen the observation by making noise.
The method may not find a small depth of one hundred meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Inarij<0xC3><0xA4>rvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and P<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>j<0xC3><0xA4>rvi reach more than 80 meters.
They have not been studied as closely as the Journal.
In particular, the bottom of Inarij<0xC3><0xA4>rvi has not been mapped accurately.
“It could well be found in unknown depths,” Kannela thinks.
If the deepest lake is defined by the mean depth, it is the Great Lake Jukaj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi, 23 meters.
In this way, your Sun will not reach the 10th depth and your Summer Water will be even further from the top.
Correction 12 August at 2.29 p.m.: Fixed the last track where the deepest lakes were wrong at their mid-depth.
Previous articleImaginary Taxation: Pensioners’ Taxation Still More Expensive
The taxation of pensioners continues to be more burdensome than that of wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the disagreement came under the House of Representatives and the pensioners were promised equal pay to the wage earners.
This is not included in the Board's proposal.
We believe that it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be able to be respected after the elections, he told the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners received reductions in income, which eased taxation.
The matter was heated up by the opposition representatives in the House, who then coal-fired the Minister of State for Finance Alexander Stubbi (coc.) from the election leave.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
Minister of State Finance Petteri Orpon (Council) said that tax cuts are mainly about securing purchasing power and not about increasing it, as wages will not be raised next year.
He says that tax cuts have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things don’t increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipil<0xC3><0xA4>n (centre) and Orpo’s desire to respect the competitive agreement reached in difficult times.
He says that sticking to the agreement is important in terms of credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government period.
It has been done by the power of labour market organisations, so it is not to be ignored by questioning.
It becomes a necessity, because the economy is so much behind domestic demand and people’s own future.
Long-term unemployment in the grip of unemployment
Ialainen calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment, at least to halt its growth.
The long-term unemployment in June was about 17,000 more than a year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s goal of raising the employment rate to 72 percent is to run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, the permit will have a very large social fall.
Ambassador: There are, of course, no Finnish casualties in Thailand's attacks
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the most urgent tourist areas, as well as to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists who are planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
There are very few Finns in Thailand.
According to Westphalen, there are very few Finns in Thailand at the moment, although their exact numbers are difficult to estimate.
The period of travel of the Finnish Thailand is extended by the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to target Finns in particular in Hua Hin in order to get information about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are away from the city at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, the cause of the attacks is not yet known.
The Ambassador believes that the events may relate to the political unrest of a divided society in Thailand and to the referendum last week on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who declared that they were against the law.
In the southernmost regions of Thailand, ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population is raging, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been targeted at tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The impact of the attacks on the course of the day is such that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: Attacks are not a matter of international terrorism
According to police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been shut down, according to the Thai police news agency.
At least four people have died in Thailand during the day, when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the popular tourist spot in Phuket and Hua Hin.
At a popular tourist destination in Finland, a holiday island in Phuket exploded four bombs at night, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require death penalty.
Two bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was injured, according to the newspaper.
In the popular tourist destination of Hua Hin, according to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today.
At least one person died in each of the twin bombings.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in Surat Thani village and Trang city.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also well known for many tourists, as it transports to Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao holiday islands.
The cause of the accident is not known
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of Thailand’s ruling military alliance, said the cause of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
“We shouldn’t make people panic anymore,” he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang were related.
He told Thai BSB that the factors were intended to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland calls on the Finnish people in the country to pay attention and avoid the most urgent tourist areas, as well as to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns who are planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Injured Europeans
Very little is known about the attacks that took place during the night in Finland and their victims so far.
Last night's attack on Hua Hin has been postponed for a bit more information.
A local woman died and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the injured are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in the last attack on Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded in the vicinity of the well-known clock tower.
Thai PBS reports that police have isolated the area in Hua Hin, which it believes has found another bomb.
Surat Thani's bomb was hidden in a flower bank, according to the provincial governor.
An employee of the municipality died.
There is at least one injured.
A police chief interviewed by CNN said that two bombs were also used in Surat Thani's attack, which exploded about half an hour later.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles wins women's four-match
United States Alexandra Raisman was second with 60,098 points and Russia’s Alija Mustafina third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for the Rio Games with standings, jumps and poles.
Biles has mastered women’s empowerment to the fullest in recent years.
In the last three years, he has won eight personal world championships.
He has won the championships of quarterfinals and permanence three times in a row, both last year and the second year.
In the U.S. team, Biles has achieved two world championships.
Darker MM-Metals Biles has hips and sides.
Thailand’s Finnish entrepreneur: ‘Father has no impact on tourism’
Esa Huovila, who runs the real estate agency in Phuket Thailand and the children’s playground in the same building, is not worried about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I do not believe that this results in anything more miraculous, says Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who worked in Asia for about twenty years.
Experienced entrepreneurs have seen many of the tragedies that Thailand has experienced.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If you haven’t seen the tourists before, that’s hardly the case.
The Huovila company office is located a few hundred meters from the blast site.
The shelter heard of the attack from its own employee.
The employee called about nine local time and said it was not worth coming to the office.
The shelter says that both the beach street and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought the processions were set for the Queen’s birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday’s feast in Thailand.
The atmosphere was calm and the main street was allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
Many people on the beach had not even heard of the attack.
Half the time of three days in Thailand the traffic in Patong had normalized and most of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila says.
Later, this car was seen in the Kruunupy in Jouxholminti.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The party found two men fit for the tokens hidden in the nearby six.
The other man was caught immediately.
The other fled, but the man was later found in the woods by a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft, and serious damage to the use of motor vehicles.
The police are grateful for the hints.
Research Director on Russia’s leadership changes: A clear shift to the exclusion
In Russia on Friday, the most high-value leadership change took place over the years, when President Vladimir Putin resigned his administration chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino from Estonia.
He is a former diplomat and served as Ivanov's second husband.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov’s separation may be Putin’s desire to prevent the strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that the recycling of executive functions is one way of using power.
This is a way of preventing people from declaring power independent of the president to themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been harassed or harassed by other executives.
Stations in Ivanoville
Ivanov, who is part of Putin’s inner circle, will move on to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
In a speech to state media, Putin said the change would be a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to move on to other tasks and proposed Vaina in his place, Russia said today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear fall in position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in the order of importance in Russia.
He notes that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the height of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but became president Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangaspuro notes that the old cards, for example, the governors, have recently been exchanged in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynn<0xC3><0xB6>niemi from the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than Ivanov’s legacy is that Putin is changing his immediate circle to a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields as they retreated in Syria
They used civilians as human shields as they fled to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not target them,” said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters seized about 90 percent of the city of Manbij that was important to ISIS.
However, according to estimates, dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Fixed earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Earlier, we mistakenly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact, ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s document line is illegal
The interior ministry’s lineup of documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, a professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that the document publicity cannot be based on the authority's own guidelines but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior has previously refused to hand over the list of participants of the Minister of the Interior’s events to Ilta-Sanomi.
The Minister reasoned on the decision with the guidance of the Office of the Council of State and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Head of Communications at the Ministry tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform its practices.
Usain Bolt's Last Olympic Performance Begins in Rio
Like the last few years, Bolt has run out of time.
He injured his back from the start and had to leave the Jamaican Olympic team behind.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in much better condition.
I've practiced well and that's the key," Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press event included a handful of samba dancers and journalists who had become fans.
Porina Bolt is alluding to the rise of a Jamaican star in an era in which public sport has struggled with doping scandals and a slump of interest.
Bolt's previous loss at the Olympics came in Athens in 2004, when he crashed at the start of the 200 metres at a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down injuries and loose your exercise routine.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began with a hundred meters, which broke the world record and the end of the self-confidence of competitors, at a time of 9.69.
This is harder.
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career goal by measuring his time.
The world records in Berlin, at 9.58 metres and 19.19 metres, are still in force.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-meter world record and a 19-second understatement, but no one but Bolt himself believes in its birth.
Bolt's main challenger is Athens 2004 Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year, in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt knocked out the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost in the finals, even if he has only made his way.
In Daegu, the 100th World Cup final did not run away from Bolt due to a fallout.
Bolt turns 30 in a week.
He's an old man in the young men's race, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year’s World Cup in London as the final goal of his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the rest.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I’m in the Netherlands, I remind myself: this year I have to do it,” Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio: Two Athletes Suspected of Doping Fraud
According to China's state news agency Xinhuan, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese student Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of being doping rich.
In addition, the Kenyan general sports coach was passed home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of the epo hormone.
She was ranked fourth in the women's 100 metre butterfly competition in Rio.
According to Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese judge has taken his doping case to the International Court of Sport’s CAS.
Xinhua reports that the sample given by Xinyi on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspects have also been identified in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female racer Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of an epo-hormone.
Kenya, in turn, has passed away from Rio to the home of a general sports coach because of a doping breach.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had become an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to media reports, this is a Kenyan fast-running coach, John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich's race pass in the situation.
Phelps doesn't stop at anything - historic gold came to the stage
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, American Michael Phelps, swims 200 metres in his 22nd Olympic Games in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to reach the Olympic gold of the same species in the quarter-finals.
Phelps's winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino placed second in the mix before China's Wang Shunia.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughs in a quick interview.
The story of Helen Skelton (opinion) on Monday is the most read of this week on the evening’s website.
Next up is Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton does not have much stress if there is a small amount of noise in the Finnish or British press about his revealing and special outfits.
The TV has visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress that certainly has at least enough exposure - at least in the eyes of many conservative British men.
However, backpacks are not allowed.
It’s important to look good, and small courts are just a fun thing.
Skelton certainly wants to soften up and maybe even get upset, but he insists he doesn’t want to be in the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
We're watching sports here, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I'm dressed.
Can you imagine that the plague has gone all the way to Finland?
I can’t, but everything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers do mornings and how big of a sacrifice they make is ok for me, Skelton laments.
You know what?
It will be empty if it comes from (the drinker’s) clothing.
I'm a little interested if this one's hit someone.
Rio police made two arrests for terror attack
Rio police said on Thursday that it had arrested two people for suspected terrorism.

Violent messages were circulated, among other things, on the popular WhatsApp service.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of Rio's whales.
Police bombed a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first leg of the Rio Basketball Tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package about the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
The police released the public after a controlled explosion of the package.
This was the third time in Rio during the Olympic Games that police have carried out a controlled blast mission.
The police closed the area because of a suspicious package found there.
The public got in when the police had controlled the explosives.
The public did not anticipate watching the match until the start of the match, as police closed the arena for a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and released the public to the public only after that.
Paukku woke up the race in a dreamy Spanish team.
With two losses, Spain started the race, winning Nigeria by 96-87 points.
In the previous two games, Spain won silver.

Argentinian Lady Dressed Up as Pet<0xC3><0xA4>j<0xC3><0xA4>-Siren - Finnish Thought for Protest
The wind at Pet<0xC3><0xA4>j<0xC3><0xA4>-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
The wind from the Pet<0xC3><0xA4>j<0xC3><0xA4>-Sire hit hard on Thursday.
On Thursday in Rio, the Argentine lady dressed in the Wind of Pet<0xC3><0xA4>j<0xC3><0xA4>-Siren at the opening of the Women’s Surfing Day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent conceded a foul.
He was left behind because of the collar, and others fled, Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete has been thinking about protest for a long time.
It was not worth it then, because, according to the Olympic rules, it would have been unnecessary.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund, said Pet<0xC3><0xA4>j<0xC3><0xA4>-Sire.
The Finnish snorkeled on the table until the last time, because he did not want to get into the dirty water of Rio.
The Finnish left with a collar on his departure instead of 27.
In total, London’s 2012 Olympic silver medallist is the eighth.
There was little impact on the collar.
Friday is an important day when there are races from 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Apart from the first information, there was no protest by Pet<0xC3><0xA4>j<0xC3><0xA4>-Sire.
7 Special Things That, According to Science, Extend the Age
Science has explored everything that is possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring additional years into a person’s life.
Some of these are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his or her life lasts longer.
Sometimes things that a person can’t influence themselves can bring him extra years.
These include, among other things, a tendency to medium-term mobility or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your lifespan.
You don’t always have to shave – just applying for a milk towel is enough.
The secret of a long life has been explored by many different studies.
The Medical Daily reported seven of the strangest research findings.
According to science, all of these things can lead to more years of life.
Drinking coffee and beer
Coffee consumption has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a “decreased risk of death,” especially in relation to neurological or cardiovascular diseases.
There are also studies that suggest that the use of alcohol - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived longer than people who didn’t drink at all.
Regular use of toothpaste can extend a person’s life by up to six years, according to one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents inflammation of the intestines.
They can, in turn, contribute to the spread of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughter affected people’s lives.
The seven-year project was attended by more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were more mature people 35 percent more likely to be alive after the test.
Sex, when sexual protection has been taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex is not enough.
In order for a person to have extra years of life, he must also have an orgasm.
There will be additional years in the industry, there will be no denying it.
However, reaching a long age does not require unconditional commitment.
One study from the University of Oxford found that women who had a large back had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study combined these factors with a lower mortality rate.
Whether it’s an Olympic medalist or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live longer than an ordinary bully.
Many studies have tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring additional years to his life.
Some researchers, however, suspect that a long life span is due to a person’s social status – which, in turn, allows, for example, the achievement of awards such as the Nobel Prize.
A study that looked at buying behaviors of people over 65 years of age found that a person who shopped on a daily basis is more likely to be a parent who shopped less often.
This is due to the fact that spinning in specific stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may lead to death.
So take your credit card out of your hands - so online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
Umpihumanain wheel soup slid towards truck
On Friday evening, a serious truck and passenger car accident took place in Koske, Finland.
The accident occurred in Koske, Koskentien and Sorvastonti in the middle of Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car had been driven to the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the collision, the truck remained upright, but set fire to the fire.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The passenger car slid into the lane and from there on the lane across the roof.
The woman, who was born in 1972, was stuck in her car.
The rescue agency removed the injured driver from his car and transported him to the Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's breathing test was 2.02 promille.
He's suspected of having a rough ride.
Posts sent postcards to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in the retail selection of Salon K-Citymarket because the mail had delivered part of the load accidentally to the Sein<0xC3><0xA4>jo.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perni<0xC3><0xB6>, was on Thursday buying spare parts from Salon K-Citymarket, when it hit the eye with a fun plate.
Unfortunately, there are product shortages in remote areas, because Posti delivered our cargo to Sein<0xC3><0xA4>jo!
We will get more when Posti gets the delivered cargo!
So if you don't crawl in a lawn mower, you read in the village.
The seller’s fourth shelf is related to the fact that in the last spring Posti expanded its services to include lawn mowing.
The grass cutting is on offer from Posti until the end of August.
According to Haltia, the site was mostly interesting and she decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update made me nervous.
Media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention paid to this matter is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday evening, Haltia’s update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got her favourites stuck in a loose-knit bag, even though a few of the barns were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Posti Enterprises Transport Services, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanomi.
The background is that three of the five stages went wrong yesterday (Sein<0xC3><0xA4>joki) and we no longer went to make a partial delivery (Saloon) with three, but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomi.
This was first reported by the Evening Messages.
Teija Haltia didn’t bother with the shelf because she found all her own freeware favourites from the selection.

Family Wish of a Woman Murdered in Loviisa: Victim's Memories for Police Dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and addresses by donating to the police.
Sipoo’s veterinary department has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim’s family’s wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication reports that the victim had worked at the Sipoo Veterinary Station as a substitute and had also completed his nursing training there.
The veterinarian's grandmother remembers the words that touched the woman.
Happy, smart, humorous and work fearless.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes to the police dogs as a whole, primarily for the purchase of safe dogs.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her hometown of Loviisa Koskenkyl.
The woman's neighbors have told the Nightlife that the victim was a good animal lover.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flowers.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder knew no woman and had no contact with each other.
A police dog named B<0xC3><0xB6>rje, who was injured in a life-threatening arrest, was involved in the tracking of the killer.
However, the storm is still alive and is recovering.
The District Court handed down a judgment in Postille on breach of the Equality Act
Posti did not have the right to withhold the salary of the employee who refused to adopt the hired worker, Kanta-H<0xC3><0xA4>mei’s right of appeal in his judgment.
The district court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the suspended salary and EUR 2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Posti could have withhold only part of the salary of the facilitator, who was responsible for the part of the facilitation of the whole day's work.
According to the district court, the employee had been placed in a more disadvantaged position on the basis of his professional association activities in contravention of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the PAU's decision to organise the postal and logistic sector.
During last November’s postseason, PAU made a decision that Posti’s employees were not aware of the shortage of broken hires.
This was first reported by People's News.

Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> and Soini repeatedly highlight the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of speech.
Putin resigns as head of government, replaces Estonian-born Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has separated the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
The place will be replaced by the son of Anton Vaino, the communist leader of the Soviet-Virus Karl Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Vice President since 2012.
It will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration on the head of state.
According to the Kremlin, Ivanov, who is part of Putin’s close inner circle, will move to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to move on to other tasks and proposed Vaina in his place, Russia Today said.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the spying of the KGB.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin’s re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU's massive buy-in to the game ban - not seen in the opening of the Election League
The world record holder of football transfers will not be seen on the field when England’s Electoral College kicks off on weekends.
Paul Pogban followed the game with England.
Manchester United's giant Paul Pogba is on the sidelines of his game against Bournemouth on Sunday at the opening of the ManU, the BBC said on Friday.
According to the British Times, ManU paid 105 million euros from Pogba to Juventus.
However, the English Football Association FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba left Juventus as a game ban.
He received two warnings at last season’s Italian Cup, and it will be a one-game ban.
That game ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on 19 August, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow's size madness is good
Accurate criteria for entertainment and ambitious visions have established Flow Festival’s status as an internationally acclaimed event aimed at the world’s top artists.
The Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festive wearers have typically expressed themselves in their own unique clothing.
One of the main artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival’s event area is settled by, among other things, art fairs and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a rock tent, says the event’s artistic director Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, held this weekend in Suvilah, Helsinki, has grown from a small district festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
In the background of success, there is a simple question: What kind of event would the actors themselves want to go to?
It is quite unusual in the production of events to think so.
Often the goal is to reach the level of necessity and act in accordance with the authority’s orders, says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors last year to 70,000 by 5,000 people.
This year’s festival will also feature a group of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because you have to make some kind of financing.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a cattle herd, controlled by a huge herd.
That's not what we want.
Over the course of 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been pushed in such a way that there are 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant counters and bars in the partially carved area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller performance stages, 15,000 people’s tents will be used as an art venue this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little crazy about size, but at the same time, we've been able to retain Flow's spirit.
If it's gone, it's not our business anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for Kallio’s work is that today even great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, the activity in the mid-twentieth century was very dependent on the support of the city of Helsinki of about 20,000 euros.
Last year, the company’s turnover from Flow was approximately EUR 6 million.
With it, you can achieve "crucial things", such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow’s visitors have typically expressed themselves in their own unique clothing.
Along with the music event, you can also talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as a special fashion.
First of all, we want to stand out from the content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s value world: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment,” says Kallio.
This year, one of the main artists is the punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge fan base in his own genre, but at the festival combining indie rock, pop music, rap and soul it is not the most typical performances.
According to Kallio, Iggy was sacked because now is probably the last time this is seen at the theatre in Finland.
We are all interested in history and the future.
It's not just what's played on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he's made some damn good gigs in the last few years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in terror
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded at the local time on Thursday evening.
At least one local woman died and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower jar and exploded with the help of mobile phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, the majority of whose customers are foreign.
They exploded at the same time as tourists began to leave the bars and return to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra told CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife conservationist who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a stunning picture of the impact.
If the tweet doesn't look good, you can check it out here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran against me and said that the bomb had exploded near the bars.
It happened in one of the largest barricades, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of injured is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on the popular island of Phuket.
Of course, no one is dead.
At the same time, a second double bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were injured.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb from Hua Hin that had not yet been detonated.
According to Thai authorities, behind the bombings are likely to be insurgent forces who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, there may also be criminal organisations involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have been busy with the activities of criminal organizations that conduct human trafficking in recent times.
KSML: This Part of New Preparedness Units Begins to Fight in War Situation
In an acute war situation, the armed forces are ordered to fight only after several months of swearing in a soldier, says Central Finland.
According to Jukka Sonnisen, the head of training for the Defence Forces interviewed by the magazine, for example, only those who are at the end of their training are eligible to fight in the event of a 5.5-month war.
According to the Head of Training, the service is first assigned to reserve personnel belonging to the preparatory teams.
No crew or reservists are assigned to a task that has not been provided with the required training, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it was revealed that the Armed Forces will begin training personnel in the immediate readiness units starting next year.
Units can be used in military operations already during the training of the armed forces, if necessary.
Pamela Tola Receives Giant Compensation From Home
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The retail price of the two-storey separate list was EUR 330,000.
However, after the sale, a serious moisture problem was discovered in the house, which caused a dangerous microbiota for health.
The couple were forced to sell their home in 2014.
The selling price had fallen to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>132,000, resulting in a financial loss to Tola and Rome of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>198,000.
The couple took the matter to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller disputed the claim, but Tola and Romana won the case in both court and court.
The court handed down the verdict in the case on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance in which the seller was ordered to pay to Tola and to Rome EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the couple’s trial and investigation costs.
The court reasonably reduced the price, because some of the repair needs of the apartment had already been known to the buyers when making the apartment trade.
However, according to the court, the reported building defects were significantly more serious than had been presented.
Tola looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had been looking for a decent home because they did not want to make repairs.
He had the impression that the building was in good condition and that there was no harm in the aspects mentioned in the audit report.
The health inspection report referred to the risk and inaccuracy of air exchange and the fact that the management of rainwater and melting waters along the rock surface is insufficient.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it did not appear that this was an urgent matter in any way.
Tola and Rome realized that rainwater coming from the rock should be managed a little bit in a few years.
Trades were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the wet problems of the apartment were much more serious.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 identified microbial growth in the building, which, according to the witnesses, were due to both the precipitation of the rock and the capillary rise in soil moisture.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector's assessment, also reach the indoor areas through the chimney.
A sample of a home care room, a basement staircase, a living room window corner and a laundry room were found in the samples of the health risk, cross-border molds or scratches.
Steels were built without permission.
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been extended against the building permit.
The Court considered that Tola and Rome were not aware of the decision of the city of Espoo prior to the trade, according to which the apartment had been subject to changes contrary to the permit.
Among other things, the terraces were built, although there were no appropriate permits yet.
Home issues, however, were a key issue in court.
According to the court, buyers could, on the basis of the information received from the seller prior to the sale, assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for any major repairs in the near future.
In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, there was no particular reason for Tola and Rome to carry out a more general inspection.
Buyers have not neglected their reporting obligations, the court of appeal states in its judgment.
Hungry archival work: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for the Nazis - Finnish register also
In a recent article by Dagens Nyheter, Christopher Andersson writes how the National Archives in Maryland has recorded documents for microfilms about a total of 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also American, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finns and 31 Swedish women wanted to become Nazism.
The documents and registration cards are from the Nazi-German racial agency.
The branch was headed by Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were carried out on women to find out.
The racial agency looked at the background of women, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's race.
Women were also to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship, to give up their manuscripts and to give good recommendations to their loved ones.
The racial agency wanted to ensure that the women were "baby lovers", "saverists", and "good national socialists", who knew very well German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides for SS men.
The case does not explain how 14 Finnish women were found from the archives.
The SS leaders created a state-supported program, known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
Among other things, the programme stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside of it.
The Lebensborn houses take care of children born outside of marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme has not been very actively promoted, as reported on the pages of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the population policy of the Nazis focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
A German mother's honorarium was awarded to women who had had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum said.

Jari Sillanp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>n Satulinna was recorded at night for a couple of hours: "I was so bored"
Jari Sillanp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> has been one of Finland’s favourite artists for over 20 years.
Sillanp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>, from the cruise ship’s barrio to the 1995 Tango, Finland’s best-selling solo artist and star of the dance ships and festivals, is still able to score and is currently in a hefty climb.
Written by Mari Koppisen, the book about the life of the favorite singer Jari Sillanp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> - Paljaana was published on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> tells about his life and career both good and bad.
The career of the bridgehead rose to a total height when he won the crown of the Tango at the Sein<0xC3><0xA4>joki Tango Market in 1995.
The cat Sillanp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself at the time.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuopapam<0xC3><0xA4>ki had composed a tango song for Sillanp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> on the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen agreed to in a slightly different form.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the song's sound didn't go exactly according to plan: Bridgehead sang it on the tape in a terrible crack and only after a couple of hours of nights.
We had a party tonight.
I was so hooked!
The head of the bridge is remembered in the book.
It was not immediately thought that the song had been sung in a krapula.
Even though I wasn’t physically at my best, the track was still good.
I learned that you don’t always have to demand perfection and excellence.
Another incident related to the man’s most popular songs, which is described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013 Sillanp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> parted from his then partner and the case ended up in the lyrics of the song You deserve gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the lyrics ordered from Saara T<0xC3><0xB6>rm<0xC3><0xA4>se were not what Sillanp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> would have wanted.
Bridgehead had imagined himself making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the song that tells the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of a 7-day newspaper news report.
In the newspaper’s news, Jar and the ex-boyfriend were told about Jar’s excessive celebration and alcohol use, but Jar said it was full of dolls and didn’t fit.
According to the book, Jari played in anger at the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and good so.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52 per cent of the voters voted in favour of the difference and 48 per cent would have remained in the Union, even though the polls for the week predicted the opposite outcome.
The British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No respected research institution or university has flagged for the difference, although a couple of individual researchers should disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of Bill Clinton’s campaign, “It’s the economy, stupid,” flew to the brink of ruin in the UK’s Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Category: Kihar language
The Centre for Macroeconomics, in its last monthly survey, will provide answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not heard, because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people who work, which is almost standard.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's really out of the UK.
Many also have the idea that lowering the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
According to the Economist, the voters did not believe in economic arguments, because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently presented.
They were skewed, in particular, by the BBC's equality, which gave as much space to economists who represent only a few percent of the economic community as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU hostile press was not interested in telling the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE about the consequences of the divergence.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, government debt, and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both heard and understood, they were not taken care of, because economists represent an elite with which voters do not think they have any common interests.
The academics of big cities like economists would have stayed in the EU, but the message did not work in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is also an economy.
The Brexit vote’s overriding profit argument was about immigration.
An immigrant will take your job, an immigrant will occupy your hospital, an immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments have prevailed.
Each café has a number of foreign employees.
How many more jobs would there be for the British if they left?
In the waiting room of each health centre, immigrants are seen.
How much easier would it be for the British to have a doctor’s appointment if they didn’t?
Every school has children of immigrants as well.
How much easier would it be for the right British children to get a place to go to school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more space would beginners have if they were to leave?
In my opinion, these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists did not succeed in responding to them, and if they did, their answers did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centres, and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to the UK's public economy and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen’s real estate fund set for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, which is managed by Pertti Vanhanen, a Finnish real estate investor.
In Aberdeen, he said, plans for Brexit were made in time by drawing up plans for A and B.
Plan B, i.e. a win for EU-disaggregated camp, started to be expected a few weeks before the vote in the event that the result would be left.
The concern was that investors would begin to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have large amounts of liquid assets, but now they could be needed.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets, says Olden, the only open daily listed real estate fund that the news concerned.
According to the old man, the normal level would be 15-20 percent.
The fund was worth <0xC2><0xA3>3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately <0xC2><0xA3>20 billion.
That was the highest number in the nine open real estate funds, according to Vanhanen of all the open real estate funds of the UK.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at or even below 10%.
So the real estate funds were prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed down the trade.
When the EU-supported camp won, Europe became confused.
However, the less than two weeks that followed the vote in the real estate market were quite peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was Mark Carney, CEO of the Bank of England, in which he assessed that Brexit could be a major risk for commercial real estate agents.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
These, together, took over the situation and brought the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous about it.
The snowball started to spin, and the fund after each other had to close its door.
Aberdeen's situation was good because of the money raised, but it also eventually had to freeze its trading for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the pricing down.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be pulled out in panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation, and most of the announcement was canceled.
Since then it has been fairly flat, and now the market has been very quiet for a couple of weeks, says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, the Aberdeen Manner-Europe Funds have not had any similar lobbying.
However, there were a lot of questions.
Irrational attention to real estate funds
In the olden’s view, the closures of the real estate funds trade received an unreasonable amount of attention.
The open funds to which the closures concerned control about four per cent of Britain’s real estate.
Aberdeen's closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of its 80 properties in London.
Some of the other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may hold its funds for the middle of 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been slashed downwards, but the situation does not appear to be "worse" from Aberdeen's point of view.
The major issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought even new opportunities to some of the real estate investors, Oldane notes.
The pound and dollar rate is at its weakest in 30 years, in addition to which the market has a 15% discount on the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar owner can now buy the same property for up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are a lot of buyers, the old man said.
Brexit Brings Downsides to London Real Estate Market
At two o'clock in the morning, the situation didn't seem very strange.
But of the four, when Pertti Olden, who is responsible for real estate investments in the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's where the power comes in.
I realized that this is now going to go to plan B, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He headed straight to work.
London City was already fully alive despite the morning.
The normally voiceless TV screens in the office were buzzing with news, and usually the loud crowd was quiet to listen fully when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to tell the difference.
When the market opened, the display ends only flashed in red.
It was a morning that I would never have believed to be alive, the old man said.
Despite the landslide, Aberdeen, one of the UK’s largest real estate funds, ended two real estate transactions on the day after the Brexit vote, in a bid to close two real estate deals.
The feeling was mixed.
However, the company was well-prepared for the option, and therefore the situation was somewhat calm, says Vanhanen.
Brexit vote starts a remedial movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
When the British leadership collapsed, the British leadership changed.
The markets were beginning to anticipate limits on the UK and, in particular, London real estate markets.
The London office space is expected to have up to 20 percent less in the coming years.
Soon, a group of British real estate funds began to freeze their trading after each other.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the poison has gone down, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not appear on the faces of Oldasen who spent his last summer days in Helsinki this week.
It is far too early for him to say much about what Brexit will bring.
So much is still open: how the difference occurs and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of London's real estate market has already been first reported.
CBRE’s data on price development in the real estate services sector covers about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, the minimum was 6.1 per cent, Oldane points out.
The numbers are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
Monthly indexes began to be published in 1987, and only in five months have there been worse numbers, says Vanhanen.
All the same major declines occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
That is why it is interesting that Brexit was quite quickly compared to the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
In the old view, the comparison is not quite appropriate, because it is now a home-grown crisis in Britain.
The tunnel is another one.
The real estate market has not seen a panic sale like that at the time, but a willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
The funding is also available normally.
The repair could have been done anyway.
In fact, the price-fixing movement is not a miracle for him – it could have been without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that the prices of properties in London and other major cities around the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
The fall started from a very high point.
London's prices have skyrocketed for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, as have the population of London.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that is globalizing, says Oldane.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investment destinations from abroad.
London is known as the city's easy destination.
In addition, prices have fed a low rate of interest, which is why, for example, pension companies have had to look for products from new items.
Loans on this have been readily available - although the debt tree has now been used significantly less, according to Oldasen, than during the pre-crisis boom of 2008.
Disperse, disperse
In London, prices rose evenly last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its holdings in London, and was also a net seller last year.
There was some kind of twist, and now it came.
What's going on?
It depends on how the UK’s economy is developing, says Vanhanen.
Many do not dare to evaluate the future, but say that no ascending peaks are hardly allowed.
The feeling suggests that there is a downward or even expenditure in front of it.
The old man has already seen several movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the coup will be solved by work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global disintegration.
If you have invested in one market, there is too much of a victim.
If it is distributed, the risks are also distributed, says Oldane.
The S-group will start to register the purchase details in more detail
The S-Group knows what you’re eating, as the Group said today it was starting to collect even more detailed information about its customers’ purchases.
So far, when information on the final amount of the receipt has been collected, the group will begin to collect it from the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S-group comes after Kesko, because the information on the goods purchased with a pluscard has been collected in the Kesko customer register for a couple of years already.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the program has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer’s consent and used for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
For a time, few customers have denied the use of product data, Riitala tells Taloussanom.
According to him, Kesko is not going to react to the S-group registration change.
Kesko already categorizes its customers according to only food purchases into ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Clients are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for the purpose of marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchasing information is only collected from the K-group’s own chains.
Our partners, such as Neste Oil, will not disclose your information.
Lidl Finland does not have a stand-alone customer programme and is not currently planning to do so.
Finland’s L<0xC3><0xA4>hikauppa has its own Ykk<0xC3><0xB6>sbonus-bank client program, which can be found in the Electoral Houses, Siwo and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect information about product or product group levels, we remain at the level of the final amount of the receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made and the day I and the final amount of the customer receipt.
We have not gone to that level as a K-group or an S-group,” says commercial manager Anu Ora.
According to him, the position-customer program is intended to be renewed in the future, but L<0xC3><0xA4>hikauppa will report on this later.
However, Ora does not promise to register product information.
At first, the experiment
Until now, SOK’s customer and customer register has been relatively large.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic data included profession, education, form of residence as well as years of birth of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role is also registered.
The S-Etukort purchase includes the date and time of the purchase, the place, the amount of the purchase and the payment method.
In addition, the information of the S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash register systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchasing data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, data in S-markets, Prismo, Kodi Terro and ABC chains are currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time, customers have had hopes that marketing could be targeted more accurately, says Marjaana Saarikoski, head of customer and partner operations at SOK.
The S-Group says it will notify its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in cash registers anyway, wanted it or not.
You can check your stored data from the S-Group website.
For example, cats do not get access to data, emphasizes Saarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is Customs' latest dog confirmation - puppy becomes first explosive dog
The black labrador retriever’s puppy carefully sews five similar boxes placed on the ground line at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport.
It won’t take long when it’s firmly sitting next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog by playing it with his favorite dog.
From the box next to which Heila was sitting, there was a jar of incense smelling on the griddle.
This is the first smell that Heila has now practiced, says Suntio, owner of Heila dog.
Security situation and e-commerce reasons for access
Heila is the first dog to specialise in the search for weapons and explosives and is set to work at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport next year.
The tasks may be carried out by Heila and Sunti, if necessary, to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be Heila's main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels have led to measures in Customs and control has been strengthened after the attacks, says the Customs Superintendent Mikko Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg.
Another reason for the training of a gun and explosive dog in Customs’s duties is the postal shipments that pass through Helsinki-Vantaa.
With the growth of internet commerce, up to 40 million postal shipments pass through the airport each year, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
Over the past few years, Tulli has made a discovery at Helsinki-Vantaa airport of some 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their starting materials, from purchases of online shopping, passenger goods and aircraft.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki-Vantaata.
It will investigate checked baggage and mail shipments.
Ports will have great benefits in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg.
Based on the performance of the helmet, Tulli assesses whether there will be more training for gun and explosive dogs in the future.
Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg is looking forward to the idea.
the Church School
The Heila-Pennu training is coordinated by the Tulli Dog School in Kirkkonummella.
Suntio also attends training with Heila with the police and the experts of the Defence Forces.
The police have extensive experience in dog training and expertise in explosives from the Armed Forces.
Customs, together with other authorities, will decide what fragrances Heila is taught to identify.
The heel is always trained as needed, says Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg.
Heila’s colleagues in Helsinki-Vantaa include six drug dogs from Customs and the money and drug dogs from Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from 10 puppy breeds.
The criteria for choosing a dog at the airport include grazing and hunting, as well as tranquility, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Sunti’s home, is a close working friend of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing without Heila getting home, Suntio laughs.
Gentle command goes to Heila at once.
The late-night cameraman loses the camera coat for the fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy-looking coat immediately from the "out" command.
Tough competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level examinations ahead, next October, to assess whether there is sufficient training for demanding work tasks.
Heila can be seen at work at Helsinki-Vantaa in the next half of the year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers can’t come to lick the workbags of the dog on top, Suntio recalls.
The cost of one working dog is about EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working life is about seven or eight years, up to ten years, after which they will retire to the care of their owner.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work parts last only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of a working dog is a fierce competition in Customs.
Heila was the owner of about 20-30 Customs employees.
Luck hit Sunti, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs as well as monitoring duties in Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal - people get a day off
Under one million people in Fiji’s Olympic gold in rugby are so highly regarded in the country that the government has designated August 22 as the national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the matter after the championship was decided.
The day off is considered the team's return home the next day.
The hero team is also allowed to celebrate in their home country.
The Fijian rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the final was followed in the capital city of Suva, where a screen was set up for the stadium.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them cheering, Fiji Times reporter Mikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish composer turned after a fierce performance
The weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt after a 175 kg hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after the lifting of the arms, he has rotated several times.
No one has ever been able to say why.
Tokola gained 175 kilos from work in Rio and 145 kilos from tempo.
His combined weight was 320 kg.
Tokola tried to get his job at the last 175 kilograms, as well as each other.
In the third company, the weights increased as a result of a huge outcry.
The body remained under pressure until the jury accepted the lift.
The joy of a Finnish waiter is that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian striker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemen Palloseura, who plays in the men's football league, has signed a permanent contract with the Estonian striker Albert Prosa at the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player in our team who has the power and whose threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through more than 50 players from all over the world with more than ten player agents.
The small team started to stand out as a good alternative to Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from rural Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played in the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to join RoPS on Saturday in the Sein<0xC3><0xA4>joki, where the Rovaniemi meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS became in need of a new attacker when last season's goaltender Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
Threatened Modern Family Star Resurrected: Teen Star Shorts Reveal Almost Everything
In the Modern Family comedy series, Alex Dunphyna, who became known as Ariel Winter, is once again rapping by portraying his daring body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don’t leave much imagination behind.
The shorts not only revealed the actor’s legs but also this backside.
18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior to be considerably bolder.
The star has posed on social media in her images in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very thin clothes.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has recently also published several pictures of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can view it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
Amy Palmer, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, said Winter is in the process of “a typical Hollywood transformation” from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost his entire life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more it looks like a bare surface, the more publicity and attention in Hollywood gets, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series at the age of 11.
The actor has teased some of his long-time fans with his image change.
It’s not hard to imagine where she will be in ten years’ time, when the downside is already so hard, says a woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of the female fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge him to be immediately critical.
You look great!
No matter what others say.
You are an inspiration to many women, sparking a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the wind: in autumn it is possible to see the autumn mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese to start the revontulimats from the beginning, Visit Finland says in the report.
Inari and Levi are the main subjects of the Japanese Revonture.
The Revontures are the maps of our winter tourism, and they are strongly combined with the warm winter and the snowy landscape.
There is a lot of demand in Lapland’s winter resorts, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Rarely do we know that the revontuli season begins from early autumn and continues far into spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the revontures of the scene twice as much as the precipitation, says Anne Lind, Head of Marketing at Visit Finland.
Visit Finland’s main target groups are wealthy 25-35-year-olds, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, among other things by online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers from the Universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landing among the Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique sights from Finland, and this revontula has huge potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown significantly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they stayed in Finland more than twice as much as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finland’s tourism as a target group, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros per day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to settle for silver in the Rugby 7 game when Fidzi's team won the gold
Britain's impressive success in the seven-player rugby union game was shattered when Fidzi won it on Thursday at Rio Deodoro Stadium in the 43–7 final.
Fidzi taught the masters in ball handling, transfers, sidewalks, support game, runners-up and raw in force, winning gold – if it was the country’s first Olympic medal in its entire history.
The loss meant silver, which was a slightly slimmer consolation for Britain, as it was the third silver in the country on the same day. They can be proud of their success as an Olympic medalist in the first ever rugby 7 tournament, in which the team won New Zealand, Argentina and E.
A solid win from the South African Boxers in the 7–5 semi-finals on the same day may have negatively impacted the team in the finals.
Despite this, the Fidzi team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-person team had been in full force.
It may be comforting for the UK to have at least one British get a gold medal tomorrow: Fidzi head coach Ben Ryan, a former coach of the English rugby 7 team from Wimbledon.
The experience has been pretty great for the UK.
Eight years ago, they lost all games in the Adelaide Sevens in Ryan's training.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
Loss is painful, but progress is appalling.
Fidzi started well and presented his interviewing skills to the UK as a matter of interest.
It looked as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had crashed into a group of moving buses, and the World Champions rose to a 5–0 lead when Ossea Kolinisau made a comeback in the corner.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwai made a second goal for his right goal.
It was 12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's stunning backlash prevented the trailblazer Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it did not slow down Fidzi's departure for a long time.
When the game was played in seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua made the goal in the right corner, after which Great Britain was 17–0 in the loss.
Nakarawa made a second goal from the re-launch, with the first half remaining over a minute.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou threw the British team through even more powerful knockouts and threw it across the finish line.
After the finish, the opening period ended 29–0.
It seemed that the Fijians were born to play the rugby of seven players, while the British are still in the role of a learner.
Which is very much true.
Britain made wide-ranging changes in half-time and managed to hold on to the Feds for a total of four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova scored a goal thanks to the Feds’ excellent team play.
Dan Norton managed to narrow it down to 36–7 by painting Britain in the left corner, but the game had long since been lost to the South Sea Islanders, whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing.
It was hard not to admire Fidzi’s pure cheerful attitude.
Mata Viliame made the final shipment to the Fijian cake by making the painting at the last moment.
The pill sounded, the Fijians squealed, and the British fell into the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fidzi had won Japan's semi-finals in the 20–5, and the United Kingdom had slowed past South Africa in a tight semi-final, where the balance would resolve the United Kingdom's draw.
Kyle Brown led the South African Boxing in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and crashed under the goalposts in the second half.
Marcus Watson, the brother of English rugby union player Anthony Watson, sealed the win and eventually the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer prompted Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win gold
There could be no more gold in this world.
From the first bet to the last bet, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning backed the history with 220 winning bets and found an additional goal for their golden moment at Estacio da Lago.
Although there were two of them in the air, the voice of third coach Robin Williams, who encouraged them to their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's doubles, making them the first women in British sports history to achieve a similar feat.
Their strength was undisputed, their winnings were already 39th in a row and once again record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes joining the water surface as you age, is not entirely in line with the nature of success.
Behind each elbow is a large group of helping hands, each of which has taken two steps towards achievement. However, the most important of the assistants is the trainer, who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who did not know then whether he would see this day.
Williams said the situation was tough at the time.
“I had bladder cancer, and I was able to cut it off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes the way of thinking a little bit.”
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The third was lucky that Williams was able to begin his treatment beyond the season of the species in early 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible if now in such a situation can even be said.
“I needed money, so I had to recover quickly.
It worked as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps is enough.
That's where it starts.
It’s a journey in itself, but it made it a little bigger.”
Immediately after the victory, the thoughts of the two were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and spoke a little more normal while trying to overcome his own discomfort.
Captain Stanning of the Royal Artistic Group of Britain, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says: “At the level of feeling, I’ve been in ruins this week, which is perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much.”
“It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we’ve worked with Helen and Robin.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so thank you so much for him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have hoped for a better person to train with, or a better coach.”
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in the last five years.
The pair have found an overwhelming rhythm to which their competitors have not been able to draw comparisons.
Even at the last 500 meters, when the two New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had additional resources.
“We were very caught up in the moment.
Helen also "Stay Married, Stay Married".
It’s very important not to run off the road.”
“We managed to leave well, and at the same time we didn’t try to do anything amazing.
We didn’t reach the skies today, we just wanted to do a good fight and win the race we did.”
The two will think for a year before deciding on their future.
Next month, Glover celebrates his birthday with Steve Backshall.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure.”
“After London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes to understand.
It feels so much better,” he says.
Iceland to replace Panamanian government with squabbling
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which are already in demand by representatives of the Panamanian media in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers exposed the tax loopholes of a number of Icelandic politicians through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day is now set for October 29.
Analysts say it’s hard to predict how much people’s recent anger will affect the outcome of the autumn elections.
In the June presidential election, criticism of the powerful was clearly seen, and Gudni Johannesson, who was elected president from outside politics, was elected.
Trump said he was sarcastic in claiming Obama to be the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has canceled his most recent impeachment speech.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the organization’s founding.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the talks and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can push you down like that, according to Clinton's tweet.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned Muslims from wearing their favorite burkini swimsuit on the beaches, according to the British newspaper The Guardian.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to the beaches and swimming is forbidden to anyone who does not have a good manner and a swimsuit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which largely express religious connections, may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove France’s national holiday to a crowd.
At the end of July, two extremist groups linked to Isis attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest who was over 80 years old.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region would pass through the barrier - Pyyk<0xC3><0xB6>sj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi
The water samples taken from the official bathing beaches of Oulu area meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only on the shore of Lake Pyyk<0xC3><0xB6>sj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi there is a blue lake.
The environmental action in the Oulu region took water samples on Tuesday and Wednesday from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing beaches in the Oulu region.
With the exception of Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and salt-based enterococci bacteria in all bathing waters were subject to the restrictions imposed by the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci concentrations of the waters of the Gulf of Meriniem were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial levels had fallen below the action limits.
The bluefin tuna caught by the Pyyk<0xC3><0xB6>sj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi swimming pool does not yet make the water undrinkable, but under favorable conditions, the situation can quickly turn into a bluefin tuna, where the surface of the water forms a blue-green dormant crust.
Environmental action follows the situation with the tightest scrutiny.
If the bluefin tuna becomes a bluefin tuna, this shall also be reported separately on the notice sheet of the bathing beach.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80% of forest owners outside
The forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the budget proposal of the Ministry of Finance next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction that would be granted on the basis of the gift tax of the forest state.
The proposal of the Ministry of State Finance has four objectives: to promote the generational change of forest premises, to reduce the age of forest owners, to increase the size of the forest space and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote the forest economy for entrepreneurs.
The forest owner would make a reduction in the net capital income of the forest economy.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generational change of forest spaces is good, commented Juha Hakkarainen, Director of the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, it is tempting to find a critical tax reform proposal.
The forest gift reduction is presented as a result of the owner's net capital income.
It is capital income, from which all other deductions have been deducted.
In the opinion of MTK and Hakkaranen, the impact of the tax reduction would be higher if the reduction could be made directly from the sales result of the tree.
The VM's proposal is based on a reduction in the net capital income of the forestry sector to prevent the loss of the capital income of the forestry sector, which would be reduced by other taxation.
Such a person would be taxed even if the tree did not sell.
The calculation model is quite complex.
The average forest owner can’t figure it out, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, according to him, the model applies only a small part of the forest owners.
The limit for the tax reduction linked to the value of forest yields is EUR 40 000 on the proposal.
It's been dragged too high in Haqqarainen's opinion.
According to him, this cuts 82 percent of Finnish forest owners out of the scope of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest owner population, he says.
In the VM, it is considered that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the capacity.
In forest policy, forest gift reduction has been carried out according to Hakkaranien for decades.
Behind it is the ageing of the forest owner community.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years old, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful raekuuro surprised motorists at Himanga - two cars slid into the street and crashed into each other
On Friday morning, there was a special backstroke on the Himanga River.
According to the rescue agency, two cars in a row crashed into the lane, after which came a collision behind the previous one.
According to the firefighter Harri Pyhti<0xC3><0xA4>, the storm is believed to have been caused by a strong thunderstorm.
There were two people in the back of the car, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver of the previous car was not injured.
The accident occurred on the highway 8 from Himang to Kalajou a few kilometers away.
A Finnish study can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research from researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments to be more effective.
The findings of the research team of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow in the usual way in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to the normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatment may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the study were published on August 4 in the journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhosi’s family murder continues in court, the prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for another perpetrator
The death toll of Muhos family continues in court for both convicts.
Two young men were sentenced in June to prison for the family's murder at Muhoks.
The second was given 8 years 4 months of murder and aggravated robbery, among other things as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for the murder and brutal robbery of a young person.
The convicted person was also given a sentence for threatening traffic safety as a young person and for transporting traffic noise as a young person.
Prosecutors, prosecutors and the man who received a more severe sentence complained about the court’s verdict.
The prosecutor demands a lesser punishment for the man who was convicted of the murder as a young person for 12 years in prison.
You were in full agreement at the time.
According to the district court, 17-year-olds killed a man who worked as a director of the school's child protection unit last July.
The 17-year-old, who was convicted of murder, allegedly attacked the driver sitting in the back of the living room on the sofa.
The conductor had gotten out of the hold and shoved the young man into his room, when another young man hit him with a vacuum tube.
Among other things, the director was also tortured in the lead, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the state of mind investigation, both defendants were at the time of the act in full comprehension.
According to the court, young people had planned to flee their homes at least from the previous day.
Ice fishing is the world’s longest-running backbone, only increasing at the age of 156
The world’s longest living spinal cord has been confirmed to be ice-bound, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern parts of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark that roams around Greenland, the holker can live up to 400 years.
The male only grows at the age of 156.
The life of the iceberg adds to the fact that it grows only one centimeter per year.
Only one species is known to live for longer than one species.
The researchers found out the age with radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on them, the researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The age of the oldest was estimated to be 392 years old – however, throwing in one direction or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as economic visa - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world.
Even a third of all the state’s tax revenues would be lost if Donald Trump’s change to corporate tax is implemented.
Tax revenues were also reduced, in particular, by the richest tax cuts that benefitted the most.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary in his presentation of it in Detroit on Monday.
The corporate tax would go from 35 percent to 15 percent.
Without collecting, there would be a really great amount, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, 33 after Trump’s downturn.
The inheritance tax would be waived in full.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation of business life and of running small businesses into bankruptcy.
The environmental standards that have been decided on by the waste must be renewed and the regulation of the energy sector must be broken.
Barack Obama's health care reform needs to be remedied.
The Board must appoint "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, the “destructive” trade policy is the biggest cause of the U.S. problem.
Free trade agreements would be terminated.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty of 45 per cent and a penalty of 35 per cent from Mexico.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our religion,” Trump said.
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will unite cities, American ships will control the sea, American steel will lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
By the way, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the aides, despite the fact that the well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists – including Republicans nearby – are seeing the U.S. take Trump’s program to a deep economic downturn.
Hillary Clinton announced her plan early on Friday for Finland’s time.
A wave of attacks on the past - People's News
The sea roars wildly, but the real wave of attack strikes in the middle of Madrid's street lane - whether an account can begin with the past.
This is at the heart of Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var’s new story.
Almodovar’s previous directorial work Travel Lovers (2013) was a small-scale and rosy satirical comedy, preceded by the Skin where I live (2011) the pinnacles of a Spanish career.
Juliet (2016) is located somewhere between the two works of art.
It is a conventional symbiotic love, human relationship and family drama, with the relationship between mother and daughter at the center.
The story is simple and we see it as a long backstory.
Life seems to be on its model for a middle-aged name character (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of an accidental encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can be in wonder all the way to the end of the movie.
In the form of a back letter and a long letter, Julieta repeats the stages of her life to her adult daughter.
He starts from the time before his daughter was born, the moment he met his future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta will be presented as a young teacher by Adraina Ugarte, from the TV series Ommelte (2013-2014).
Juliet’s aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a kitchen, but I would say that it’s time for a quick and verbal one-off.
For Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var films, there is often a fair distance in Juliet due to its so distinctive versatility.
It is a well-played, controlled, place with good music, and a rather depressing film, where it is the element of elegy.
Instead, the typical visual color blindness for the Spanish director is on it and in such a way that it starts to put a little bit of silence in the eye as a more pure form rather than acting as a dramatic effect.
People in the film experience illnesses, deaths, or just sudden losses, but the surface remains the same in Korean.
This applies in particular to the costume: in the case of the name person, the outfits change from scene to scene, and the same applies to the replacements that appear.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var is precise in these matters, but the main point, that is to say, of each case, is not particularly immediate.
Mechanically, when repeated, the impression is superficial and slightly breathless.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has written a book on the basis of three novels by Alice Munro, a 2013 Canadian Nobel Prize laureate.
Novels have been published in Karkulainen: Narratives.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly balanced literary filmmaking.
The elements would have been emotionally unmatched by even more intense drama, while the theme of leffa deals with big things - especially the film's guilt.
Directed and written by Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
Main characters: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film's premiere date is 12.8.
The government is trying to win elections - People's News
New cuts are not being made, the ministers are shaking so that the fundamental Finns do not collapse completely.
However, the operations decided in the spring are carried out by the wholesaler.
There will be no further surgery.
The four billion savings already decided is enough.
This is confirmed by Prime Minister Juha Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> (centre) and Minister of State for Finance Petteri Orpo (council) under the budget tour.
Keep in mind that there are no new cuts in the VM's presentation, because the social security cuts were decided already in the spring frame.
Children's allowances, national pensions, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of unemployment insurance for women is reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
The training sessions continue.
Obsessed with customs
Why do the ministers insist so strongly that no new cuts are being made on them?
Because next year is election year.
The elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the election year, not the Gallup.
Rather, it has been seen that the municipal income that leads to the different directions of the governing parties is spoiling the mood of the government for a long time.
However, the Gallup reports that the ruling party of the Finnish fundamentalists expects a stagnation, even though its previous elections resulted in a modest 12.3% turnout compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns received 752 new mandates, most of which will realize the price of influence in right-wing governance next spring.
The lifeline of the government of about three major parties is in the possession of the Finnish constitution.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted have had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's presence have also surfaced.
There will be no new cuts in the rhetoric, first of all, the fact that next year they will be done vigorously and secondly, the attempt to soften the expected blow to the Finnish people.
Big cuts in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different if the Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> government is still able.
The government has set a target for debt collection during this election period, but Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal will take on EUR 5.9 billion more debt next year than this year.
After the convention, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands in the middle of the election year and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own agenda: the debt did not mature or even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
This means new, even more severe cuts in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would be at least close to balanced in 2018 and then in the spring it will be accepted in the parliamentary elections.
These actions did not result in debt
It is quite clear that the current measures do not lend themselves, although Juha Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> will try to soften the positive atmosphere.
The rounds presented by the Secretary of State, Martti Hetem<0xC3><0xA4>ki, at the budget briefing, demonstrate this irrevocably:
The global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. no call for aid from the international economy.
Finland’s national economy has not just risen since the 2008 recession, except for the temporary recovery policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent this decade and has increased from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment is now costing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion more per year than in 2008.
With Hetem<0xC3><0xA4>ki’s presentation, public debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent over the next half-decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt default presented by the Leftist League was rejected because it was held to be irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will be covered in practice by taking on a completely new debt.
This is the perception of the center, the assembly and the fundamental Finns of what is responsible.
Question: The municipalities want to leave a lot of tasks
Three out of four believe that the organization of child daycare, youth work and exercise is part of the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population also blames the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic centres, building supervision, education and waste management.
The responsibility of the county, for its part, is most clearly to be sought by county grants, special medical care, vocational training, vocational colleges and the institution of care for the underdeveloped.
None of the tasks under the responsibility of the municipalities are to be transferred to the state.
Underage rider runs behind-the-scenes to run away from police
A 16-year-old motorcycle driver drove a police party in Joensuu on Friday night at half-time.
The police party tried to stop the motorbike running without lights, but the young man went to drive the police away at a fair speed.
The rear-wheel drive continued on Sonkajanranti, from which further on to Sorronahonti and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle was driven out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster policeman ran away to catch the run.
The blast test performed on the driver showed 0.75 promils.
He also didn’t have a driver’s license that would have allowed him to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
There was a truck on the road.
The truck in Kivilast crashed into the yard at Polvij<0xC3><0xA4>rvi Kaavinti on Thursday evening at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted to the left of the map, out of the road, and fell into the lane next to it.
The rescue agency pulled the injured driver away from the wreckage through a door that remained above the wreckage, along with rescue helicopter personnel and first responders.
Lifting the vehicle remained the responsibility of the owner of the car.
A drop of oil flows from the vessel to the hydraulic oil that the rescue facility absorbed into the turmeric.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman went missing in the afternoon.
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since noon in Lahdenk<0xC3><0xA4>l<0xC3><0xA4>-Pohjanmaa.
Police are looking for a woman about 165 centimeters long, thin and well-groomed with white hair under her forehead.
Observations and hints about the missing movements are requested to call the Nordic Situation Centre's reference number 0295440513.
Elements of immaturity in the air - see photo gallery about the destruction of Parafest
The fall flow covered the tents of the Parafest Festivals caused considerable destruction.
Arto Pippuri, president of the Parafest Association in Joensuu, estimates that the festival will be financially accessible, and the event will also be held next year.
The last performance of Parafest's Kalle Salonen was performed at the end of Friday night on a tori boat.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances held in the premises of the city theatre from 1 p.m.
The Art Centre in Ahjos has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15 hours.
The program is organized in a planned manner.
Sliding currents are generated in the thunderstorm when your rainwater and its weight trigger a downward airflow.
Changes in the shape of the water of the Ukkosvuva bind to heat, and as a result, the downward air cools and its velocity towards the ground accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that there are several surges in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict the route of shockwaves.
The shockwave hit the back yard of the Art Museum in Joensuu on Friday afternoon before five o’clock.
Three tents fell into a coma, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people slightly hurt themselves.
Among them was one child who was transported slightly injured for follow-up treatment.
Air pollution is getting worse for Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners gets older more quickly than usual.
The reason for the ageing of the skin is air pollution.
The British study is based on the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyzed London without the most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many elderly people in London is two and a half years older than that of an elderly friend who lives in the countryside.
Small particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollution, which is the source of transport fuel.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners each year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outermost layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early aging is a risk, especially for those Londoners who are walking on their work trip near crowded streets.
Londoners can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with different masks, but regular cleansing of the skin is recommended for a more practical solution.
The brakes of the tractor were deceiving - would snatch in front of the man
The man had moved stones around his yard with a tractor.
When he had got out of the tractor and went to visit it, the tractor brakes slipped and the tractor poured over the man.
The man did not stay under it, but the tractor got a dead man to the extent that he was transported to the central hospital with serious injuries.
The tractor didn't get any more pain, because it hit the stones in front of it.
Retirement with the latest force for the coming period
Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship, will start the series in October with better starting points than men’s memories.
The team has been in the box for three weeks now.
The common tone is certainly better than the previous covers, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani S<0xC3><0xA4>is<0xC3><0xA4>, who will continue as head coach of Rienno, is encouraging the new team to be ambitious and united.
In the Rienno, Fred Musoni will start his second term in the third round of the tournament.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who plays for the Rwandan national team, is a 205-cent hooker.
Garchet is a passenger, the Brazilian has a size of 198 cents.
Josban, Kataja and Jokipoki to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost every saliband World Cup since 2003.
Now in Tampere there are already six races going, only 2013 was left to Canada to be better in the North American qualifiers.
I was in Turku working and playing with the target women when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a Saliband national team.
I was interested and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City, Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen went to Joensuu University to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, such a species was not yet played at SM level as salibandy.
S<0xC3><0xA4>hl<0xC3><0xA4> was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later ice hockey in Jokipoi in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played with the university in the Salibandy SM series for the 1991–92 season, the following three times spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he prepared the A-girls for the championship.
The women's SM series peaked in silver in 1995.
In all, Jumppanen played in the women's SM series through 10, earning a total of 169 games 51+34<0x3D>85.
The last season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu V<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>n<0xC3><0xA4>nen were named to the national team
Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Tatu V<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>n<0xC3><0xA4>nen from Joensuu was selected for the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament from 6 to 8 November.
The 25-year-old Perttu Puska, who is attacking in Helsinki’s Er<0xC3><0xA4>, has played this before six men’s fielding, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4<0x3D>13.
Tatu V<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>n<0xC3><0xA4>nen, a 32-year-old defender from Wiler-Ersigen, Switzerland, has recovered from the virus and is part of the national team’s standard campaign with 117 field experience.
The national team was also named after Mika Kohonen, the head coach of the Sein<0xC3><0xA4>joki Players, who was seen in the Finnish shirt for the last time last December at the World Cup.
The main coach of the Salibandymaa team is Petri Kettunen.
Beach volley sculptor Essi Hasun's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold missing from the prize box
Essi Hasu is going to end as a beach volleyball player at least temporarily after the season.
The Finnish championships at Beach volley will be decided at the Kouvola Sports Park on weekends.
Over the course of three days, the instruments are played in both adult and young series.
In cooperation with Kouvola Aeroballists and the Finnish Aeroball Association, the SM final tournament will qualify for the top six pairs of each series.
The local colour of the tournament is represented by Elim<0xC3><0xA4>ki NMKY raised by Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to the games in front of a well-known audience.
Hopefully as many as possible will be able to watch it on the weekend.
I'm sure it's going to be a great arena for the laundry.
I haven’t played in the adult series very often in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in the finals at home,” Hasu said.
Kouvola’s combination ignited Hasu’s passion for sports and gave good vibes for great entertainment.
There are many memories of childhood in my mind.
I started flying ball at the age of 9 in the E-girls of Elim<0xC3><0xA4>ki NMKY.
The main thing is in the mind is too big a toy, knee protectors running on the knees, and great screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small town, the sports club had a tight community where everyone knew each other.
The collective spirit of the group created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were heavily involved in the operation - a teammate's father trained us and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural choice during the junior season as a counterweight to the indoor ball.
The K<0xC3><0xA4>r<0xC3><0xA4>lammi swimming pool has been playing bees since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to watch the Junior SM Tour competitions myself, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays in the SM finals on weekends with the small-town Anniina Parkkisen.
After Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahten, the goal of the second penalty shootout in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a metric.
SM-gold is still missing from the prize box, Hasu throws it with dignity.
The appearance of the weekend in Kouvola may be Hasulle’s last appearance in front of a celebrity audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for civil society are expected.

Salomon Koli boldly went on to become an agricultural entrepreneur
As an entrepreneurship, agriculture means risk-taking, flexibility and resourcefulness.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, started as an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in the countryside as well.
Koli started the scene two years ago, together with his younger brother Valtteri Koli, as a continuation of their homestead.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as an agriculturist meant borrowing and increasing the volume so that bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing ever since I was a kid.
I’ve always loved the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I’ve put everything into the game.
If something starts, I think it has to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build pistachios, and at first the bank wasn’t excited about it either.
However, I really bravely went along with the project and have been fully involved in it, Salomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not believe in producing pure Finnish food and that everything is still going well.
The goal of Salomon Koli, a meat car-growing company, is to invest in an even larger cattle farm.
The work has produced results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of the Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible win.
She will be able to vote on the magazine’s website until August 21.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was 1 % in July.
This is the highest value for many years (after June 2012) and the first time it has risen above zero since October last year, when the country reported 0.2% of positive inflation.
The CPI’s annual average inflation over the last 12 months (from August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (from August 2014 to July 2015) was –0,8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101,0 % compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1,0 %.
As of the beginning of the year, the inflation rate (compared to July 2016 as compared to December 2015) has been –0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was –0.2%.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, prices for the following categories of consumer goods increased: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), vehicles (1.8%), refreshments and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, home appliances and temporary care (0.5%), and health (0.1%).
Prices for the following product groups remained at the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's anime effects are being criticized as Asian cartoonists
Snapchat says it was the anime that inspired that filter, but some observers think it’s racist.
With Snapchat’s lens tool, around 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identities in ways that bring absurdity closer.
You can turn yourself into an anana, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
The lenses are unadorned, feature-defining tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfies per day.
All false steps are quickly made available to the general public.
Snapchat’s lenses have been partially criticized for being accused of favouring blackface makeup or bleached skin tones as a beauty option.
So when it offered to some of its users this week a filter that changed their eyes to scratches, mistaken teeth, and made bubbles, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
The reviewers also wondered whether these repeated conflicts refer to a larger problem that the company has with the difference.
The news and anger spread across the country on Wednesday, and were reported in the online editions of The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat said it had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended as an homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of insulting stereotypes.
Part of the controversy is fiercely anime-like.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweets were widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "at least offensive and annoying".
He adds: "It is difficult to dispute the similarity of a very tasteless Asian caricature to the effects of the filter.
It shows that the filter is not only "yellowface", but that it has been taken to a degrading extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company that needs to avoid these cultural gains.
In American culture, there is an endless struggle for diversity and social participation, always from corporate governments to Hollywood and the devices we carry with us.
Snapchat’s large audience consists of young people who are more diverse from ethnic backgrounds than their parents did. This may mean that they are likely to expect even more subtlety.
“When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that offends the user, these types of things are no longer very easily ignored, as before,” Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview Thursday.
Zhu, who works as a product manager and designer in the Medium publication, decided on Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In his article and phone interview published in the media, he said he believed that ethnic conflict reflected a lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat’s recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company for the majority of its white and men-only leadership and decided to post it on the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that their one-sided staff doesn’t have colored people when they can make decisions like this, or they have colored employees as well, but their position isn’t such that they would dare to tell their opinions directly,” he said.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely declined to respond to the claim.
The company does not publish figures from the ethnic backgrounds of its staff by withdrawing its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss its staff’s ethnic background, but it said the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented groups of people and to promote participation within the company.
For his part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: “I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say that this is not OK.”
According to the Congressional Panel of Experts, Military Officials Misunderstood Intelligence Information on Isis
A congressional panel on Thursday released a report that said U.S. military officials, the Central Command, had changed intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than what is happening in the field.
The presidents of the House Armed Services Committee, which is responsible for the investigation and defence budgets, set up a working group to report on the general satisfaction of the intelligence analysts of the Armed Forces in the interim report.
Central Command, short for Centcom, is a U.S. Army headquarters in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The results of the investigation, approved by the senior leaders of Centcom, generally gave a more positive picture of the US’ actions against terrorism than what the facts on the ground showed, and were, without exception, more positive than what the intelligence community reported in a press release,” the report said.
“Centcom’s events cannot be accepted – our soldiers suffer when high-level political decision-makers are presented with false analyses,” said Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
"Centcom's management portfolio errors reach the highest level of organization."
The comprehensive 10-page report details the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015, which include the Central Command’s descriptions and analyses of American actions to train Iraqi forces.
While the report does not contain conclusive evidence that the reports ordered by the Obama administration have been falsified, it provides an analytical picture that gives the impression that Centcom executives would have pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
“In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command’s press releases, statements, and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than what was actually happening,” the report said.
"For example, a Centcom official made a public statement saying that a major military coup to retake Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015."
Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, is still under ISIS control.
“After months of research, this is very clear,” Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
“From mid-2014 to mid-2015, intelligence leaders in the top U.S. armed forces manipulated the results of the investigation to reduce the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.”
The Republicans formed a working group after they learned about the suspicions of the analysts that intelligence on Isis was being manipulated.
The report, which was published on Thursday, will be followed by more detailed results, as studies continue.
In addition, the Superintendent of the Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which were partly consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Group.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an over-restricted process that evaluated intelligence on Isis and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democratic researcher on the committee.
According to Schiff, this process “delayed the publication of intelligence findings, “delayed the morality of analysts” and “remains insufficiently divergent views.”
However, according to Schiff and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust its conclusion to a “pre-determined or political official line.”
The Daily Beast news website reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of a congressional investigation.
Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by a Pentagon superintendent that was initiated as a result of complaints by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Department of Defense did not comment on the congressional report as long as the superintendent’s investigation is ongoing.
However, he says that: "Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key national security issues."
The investigation also has other implications, in addition to seeking to ascertain whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a claim made by an increasing number of defense agencies).
However, the allegations made last year may have questioned how much President Obama can rely on the Central Command and its fair assessment of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other critical areas.
Criticism of self-reporting information reflects disagreements that arose more than a decade ago, when Centcom's investigative analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that found that the government of President George W. Bush, despite the objections of many analysts, ignored the objections of the
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against Isis intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker Working Group reached a conclusion that, despite opposing public statements, the exemptions to Isis-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group, as it had built temporary refineries and managed to sell them.
However, the results of the study were not transmitted outside of Central Command, reports The Times in September.
Centcom’s then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many lawmakers had assessed the Senate’s witness statements as being too positive about the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as commander of the Central Command.
The U.S. wins the fourth women's doubles qualifier in the women's field hockey and consolidates its position in the midfield with Britain
After scoring three goals in a 6–1 game against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's national hockey team on Thursday, when the U.S. won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam wasn’t sure if he had done the same thing before.
“I have no idea,” he says.
"I'm not one of those people who likes to make a list of goals."
However, he knows this: the Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games and shared the first place in their group with Britain, which continued its winning streak in Thursday’s 2–0 victory over Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will play on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams survived the final round, which will decide which of them will be the first and which of the six teams will be the second.
The first-placed avoids meeting the hard-hit Dutch team, who won the second block for a longer time.
Despite Saturday’s game, the Americans have already raised their surprise success in these games, four years after it was the last of the 12 teams in the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time in his career, he was only three years old (his older doubles team played at Drexel). He became a team player at the age of 16 and was thus the youngest team player of all time.
The 2008 Olympic Games left him with no way to make it to the final list of players.
After that came the 2012 races, in which he and his team did not see much success.
The following year, the English coach Craig Parnham was appointed, after which things began to change.
“The change was cultural, spiritual and physical,” Bam says.
“Our work in London was not what it is now.
We have made a full translation.”
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the scoring in the first half by hitting the ball near the innings.
India had come into the game without a single tournament win, but it turned out to be a surprisingly tough opponent and kept the 1–0 situation until the third season, when Bam stepped into the field.
Bam carried the ball along the left side of the field for a long time, hammered it into the middle field, hit the ball into the goal, and led the Americans 2–0.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the fourth half.
The game was the first in the tournament, where U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, the American goal had scored one touch in each.
Briggs is now living his successful career.
Just like Bam.
“Our investment is good now,” Parnham says, but how good it is depends on the outcome of the game on Saturday.
The trampoline in the middle of the Olympic hall brings Zen
No matter where or when the Olympic Games are held, it is inevitable.
Rio de Janeiro’s events, competitions and struggles seem to be the next exciting message, constantly and everywhere.
It is as if the Olympic gold medallion itself is a swirling communication cable that moves from a springboard to a swimmer, from a swimmer to a gymnast and a gymnast to a triathlon.
You can’t open a TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the coffee shop without ever hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The Olympic’s first-ever Dooley charm smiles and could well be everyone’s lip-syncing name, which would be seen and belonged to the best viewing and listening time, would be popular with sponsors and would appear on good-mind TV ads if he were just a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing in the Olympic gold trampoline.
The Olympic Games do not evenly illuminate all competitions.
Far from the center, there are some lesser-known sports, such as volleyball, volleyball, volleyball, and taekwondo.
We will always have a breaststroke, and let the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I get permission to write a modest story about my own special taste, I want to pay attention to the controlled attraction of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility over the last 16 years has been so low that many people I interviewed didn’t even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
The U.S. has been involved in the Olympics, but the country has never reached the medals and has not progressed to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, the medals seem to go to the Chinese and the Russians, and the women's side of the medallist has been missed by the Canadians.
China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie MacLenna will defend the gold medals they won in London this year.
The trampoline, however, has the attraction of the underdog, partly because it sounds more suited to the circus school than to the Olympics.
(In this context, I acknowledge that I am not an expert, just an ordinary fan.)
The species has its comic potential, which in the cartoons has been used in continuous pumping episodes of characters. But it also has the same value as in the gymnastics and swimming pool, i.e. the species that join the trampolines substantially.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampoline, which means "trash board".
The ambitious masters jump with a huge trampoline, which sinks them to a height of almost 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, the jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements, such as turns, skills and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, jumps are assessed on the basis of performance, difficulty level and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the championship of the trampoline force, of which 16 are men and 16 are women.
The most common direction of the Olympic Games is straight forward.
When it comes to reaching gold, it has to go further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the finish line, sometimes backwards around the field.
In addition to the finish line or the starting wall, they also have another goal, which they seek in television news stations, namely a world or Olympic record.
This determined goal is lofty, admirable, even fanatical – and even enough to get the viewer into tears.
But I also find this a bit exhausting only when looking at cats.
This trampoline offers a breath-taking experience.
In the trampoline, the direction is upwards.
The goal is not to move forward.
The enforcer jumps up weightlessly like an astronaut, falls down and swings back up without any trouble.
Of course, the species also belongs to the competitive aspect, and it is also not easy, but it does not involve a rush to the finish or a jump to the far, only a dreamy and sultry combination of time and gravity.
It’s as close to Zen as only the Olympic Games can get.
The women’s qualifiers and finals will be held on Friday afternoon and will start at 13.00 local time and the men’s matches will be held on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which begins on both days at 2 p.m. local time.
In the middle of Olympiamania, there comes a peaceful and wonderful moment, which in the middle of the general gap could be overlooked.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering attractive male heroes for viewing and objectifying them – as the U.S. male paratroopers recently suggested by the Wall Street Journal – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for a stunning new cast of fans.
The entire generation is protesting in Ethiopia, which is a long-term ally of the United States.
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
The government forces have broken down the demonstrations demanding political change in violence across Ethiopia.
According to the eyewitnesses, several protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia collapsing?
For the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable and reliable allies of the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
Over the past few months, however, the country has been revitalizing anti-government demonstrations, which are spreading to ever wider areas.
Just last week, thousands of people took to the streets and demanded a thorough political change.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was merciless.
According to the eyewitnesses, police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
The video, supposedly from the demonstrations at the end of last year or the beginning of this year, shows how security forces are beating on the heels of young people who have been forced to stand by the wall.
The UN’s chief human rights officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep the country united, and it’s even harder to move forward,” says Rashid Abdi, research director of the international crisis group on the African Sarvi project.
Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, after Nigeria, whose stability has been promoted by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence support Ethiopians closely in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, get so much help from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown at a rapid pace.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, and the capital Addis Ababa is even a new hub.
The streets of the cities are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Ethiopia, however, is still far from the model of democracy: human rights organisations have consistently reported on the government's policy of sort, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissenters are quickly silenced.
Many people have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
“If the people are suppressed and have no choice but to show their minds, it will break out,” says Seyoum Teshome, a professor at the University of Central Ethiopia.
“The whole young man shows his mind.
The whole generation is protesting.”
There are many issues of dissatisfaction, from land use to the government coalition’s torture product.
After last year’s widely criticized elections, the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat previously held by the opposition, as a result of which they now control the entire parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the Eritrean border, where a tense situation called for hundreds of deaths in the fighting in June.
Analysts fear that in recent years, more or less fragmented separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit mixed-use and re-arm themselves.
There are many reasons for why the broken mood that has bound up under the surface for years is breaking down right now.
The first is the obvious culprit: smartphones.
Only a couple of years ago, Ethiopians were able to communicate on social media when cheaper smartphones became commonplace and the availability of the Internet improved.
Even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during the protests, many still access the Internet through the intermediary servers that hide their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this was how they invited people to the demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oromos and the Amharas.
The Oromos and the Amharas are not natural allies.
For the most part, the amharic peoples from the top of Ethiopia have long dominated the country’s politics and business, and have torn down oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in the subregions.
But this too is changing.
“The cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella,” says Oromo director Mulato Gemechu.
The biggest demonstrations have been in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many Amharas and Oromos experience that Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by a tiger tribe, which accounts for only about six percent of the population, and yet dominates the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Meles served as prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an unnamed disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical nero who could see behind the corner.
According to analysts, he was particularly skilled at detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using envoys who agreed on the differences between the opposite parties.
“The current government lacks this essential insight,” says conflict researcher Abdi.
Ethiopia’s new Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into the shoes of Meles almost out of ignorance.
Unlike Meles, who came from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to analysts, he does not have the confidence of the security forces managed by the tiger home.
Many people are afraid of this, which means more blood transfusions.
In Ethiopia, similar riots were experienced in 2005, when thousands showed their minds against the elections, which, according to analysts, the government first truncated and then stole.
In the post-election riots, many protesters were killed, but there were fewer deaths than in the previous months, and the riots ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised the leaders of Ethiopia for their far-reaching infrastructure design, such as a new megalopolis, and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it has clearly not prevented the internal good towards the Ethiopian government from intensifying.
And the kauna is taking on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month in the Amhara city of Gondar, protesters attacked tiger-owned businesses, and the hate speech against tigers is becoming more widespread on social media.
According to analysts, the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in a position to support the situation.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for the unoccupied, neighboring Somalia for observation aircraft, but the base has recently been closed, according to the United States.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its already unstable ally in the region to collapse.
“This requires a tight balance,” Abdi says.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he called Obama the founder of ISIS
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to retract his words in his latest campaign, arguing that he was not serious about claiming several times this week to be the “founders” of President Obama and Hillary Clinton’s terrorist group Isis.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to send a clear message to the citizens of his country.
His supporters will also find themselves in a questionable situation, who will have to try to defend their candidate in these stormy moments and explain the comments that he may not have meant.
Trump made the claim at an election rally on Wednesday evening and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed the president and Hillary Clinton-created Isis.
On Friday morning, however, Trump tweeted and said his claim was sarcasm.
Trump tweeted his speech from the day before, when he said in several interviews that he was serious about his allegations.
When radio presenter and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down from his claim.
The latest wave of criticism came as Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as the number of supporters fell.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy talks in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back on the subject.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton’s proposals would raise taxes, and said Clinton’s speech was agonizing.
Trump has defended the sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received widespread criticism when he appeared to urge the Russians to hack into Hillary Clinton's email and later explained his comments by saying, "Of course, I was sarcastic."
In this way, Trump extends the limits of political speech and withdraws his words if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing certain messages that evoke a response in his supporters. He looks at how supporters react to messages, and then ‘resolves’ in one way or another depending on the reactions,” says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who is also a prominent commentator on rubber.
"But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows they're round enough to pass through different thresholds."
Instead of softening his remarks to the general election, Trump has in recent days changed his style even more steeply as his support numbers have continued to decline.
A new poll by NBC, the Wall Street Journal, and Marist on Friday reported that Trump’s support is significantly smaller than Clinton’s in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is closely balanced.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or not understanding his humor.
But after getting more and more eye-catching in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporters in a distressing position where they have to publicly defend Trump’s comments about how provocative they are.
One of Trump’s most prominent supporters, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended the presidential bid vigorously in a CNN interview on Thursday.
“I consider his words to be justified, a political speech,” Giuliani said when asked if Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded Isis.
“It’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization that Obama mistakenly called a ‘lower-order team’ and that’s why it happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq.”
Most U.S. Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, let Isis continue to act when it failed to deal with the situation deliberately in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday’s election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, accusing them of suppressing his speeches and discriminatory attitudes towards him.
He joked about the "unforgivable and regrettable" television commentators who are trying to make him clear, but he says they can't make it.
Some Democrats ridiculed Trump’s explanation, saying it only made it more clear that he was not fit to be president.
A coffee shop that has ceased to open in Greenpoint due to an increase in unfair rent
Verb Cafe was a bit of an empty café in Williamsburg, where the payment was only cash and there was no Wi-Fi, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the cafe was priced out of its street guard spot on Bedford Avenue when the rent went unreasonably.
Verb Cafe replaced Soap Cherie in the summer of 2014 to sell cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals consider this to be an affront to the loss of a café under the middle class.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is changing, I know, but I still can’t believe the CBGB club is gone, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But while New York is no longer the same, a new one is also being created there.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb coffee shop has Wi-Fi and you can pay with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still impeccable.
Coffee is still good, too.
The owner and head of the new Verb cafe is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café.
He started at Verbi in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to fund the opening of a new cafe, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it re-introduced even the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says he wanted to try something new, too.
added new products to the list.
Available with bacon-orange cheese sandwiches and full of caprices and browned onions.
There are also dark spots on the list.
Coffee is no longer served with beer, but instead with juices made from fresh fruits.
After nine months of coffee, Rodriguez says he noticed that old regulars began to visit Verb as a steady stream.
“Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg,” he says.
One such is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited the cafe on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
When he moved to Greenpoint, he took a walk in Williamsburg to Verbi.
When Verb was shut down, he says he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I knew I liked Verb’s coffee and culture,” he says.
Now he is drinking coffee again, although on that Sunday he took instead of his regular iced coffee, which is also a turn-on.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been faithfully visiting Verbi since 2003.
He always went to the cafe before work and ordered the same.
“I walked into the cafe every day guarding more than seven, like a machine, and there they were already making my voiggel with all the fillings,” he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to his menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but from time to time he changes his bagel with bacon, eggs and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says it's not a good idea for a soap shop to take the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to make a special soup, which uses Verbi’s own cold brewed coffee.
"We may still be taking the offer," Rodriguez says.
Also in Greenpoint, the Poles who traditionally lived there have welcomed the café with pleasure.
One of the new customers turned into a foodie, and Rodriguez now says he is looking for a suitable place for him to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought with it other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell a coffee shop for cold-pressed coffee.
The café may also be extended to the adjacent building.
However, for many customers, it is enough that they get their old favourites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular in Williamsburg, and he says his heart broke when the cafe was closed.
When a new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like I had arrived home,” Whitt says.
"I smelled the coffee."
The Great Lamb in a New Food: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after his rise as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office at the White House.
President Roosevelt, known for his culinary prowess, had a preference for the luxury foods of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as pineapple pie and Maryland’s turtle soup.
On that day, his food was more modest: the devil’s eggs in a tomato sauce, potatoes, and a dessert from a young goat.
“It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffer,” says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to Americans how they should eat.”
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights work as both food historians.
Coe’s latest book, Chop Suey, tells of Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman’s latest book, called 97 Orchard, tells the story of the apartment building in the Lower East Side through food.
Their new collaborative work is Harper’s A Square Meal, published Tuesday, which depicts the history of American food as a major turning point in the 1930s.
The couple demonstrated their own culinary solidarity as a meeting place with the supplier of Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron Mountaineer, and opened in the same year as the great stock market opportunity took place, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a creamy and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe for turkeys, potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the supplier ordered meatballs, the couple said it was suitable for a discussion about eating a very large lamb.
“The concerns were very popular,” says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut butter, liver butter, and papaya butter.
They were made from materials that were cheap and sufficient.
“Imagine eating so many peanuts that they’re enough for the whole meal.”
Andrew Coe is furious.
"It's got to press on the stomach like a lead," he says.
Before the big down years, the American dining table especially in the countryside acted on the buffet principle of "eat as much as you want".
The women made food for the farm workers, and for breakfast, lunch, and dinner were served counter-cooked cakes.
It was the Americans who had sent food to Europeans who were hungry during the First World War. A Square Meal is a chronicle of the ways in which the people survived when they suddenly had to give up.
“This was the time when food became a central and distressing topic for Americans,” says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Just as distressing was the new low-cost diet: according to Ziegelman, evasive foods such as snacks and barbeques became the main food, and barbeques were said to be "a powerful way to make use of food chips", because chefs might be tempted to hide them in the ovens
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which had been a key part of the American diet for years, became a cost-effective luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried, the most important of which was the fulfillment of calorie and nutritional values and not so much taste or even a healthy kitchen sense.
While doing research for the book, which also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman made baked cookies filled with peanut butter as a meal of the day.
"It didn't get popular at the dinner table," says Coe, who
Ziegelman added: "It was unreal.
The peanut butter and baking soda don't fit together at all.
This was typical of many household recipes.”
House economics experts, such as Louise Stanley, who served as the head of the Federal Office of Home Economics from 1923 to 1934, guided the citizens’ appetites in a way that was unprecedented and unique.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and periodicals, and encouraged women to be precise budget holders and to respond to the challenge of making porcupine-flavored tasty dishes like carrots.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic flavors.
Particularly tasty are the explanations of the reaction of the government to its hungry citizens, such as the attitude of President Herbert Hoover to "let me eat cake."
While publicly praising the simple food of his childhood on an Iowa farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a fine gentleman who had become him.
“He liked Manner European cuisine, like fish and cucumber sauce,” says Coe.
"He almost ate in a gold-plated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was a complete stranger to reality.”
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had encouraged him to show an example on his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired an economist who was not interested in taste at all, the food served in the White House was not only the dullest in Washington, but also the worst-prepared.
Many of the mud-time foods were discarded as soon as the earth got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition continues to be seen in how we pay attention to calories and nutrition and how science has been applied to the diet.
When writing the book, the couple began to better understand Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as why she couldn’t throw food away.
“She was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away,” says Coe.
“People even started to get sick of his food,” Ziegelman recalls.
"For example, once upon a time."
After the main dishes had been emptied at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe brought up the boned dessert they had prepared at home, the same one President Roosevelt had eaten at lunch.
“It’s called a cream cheese,” Ziegelman says, adding that giving a name to the modest recipes was a common practice.
There was no cream cheese, just cream, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We swam our spoon reluctantly into its thick brown mantle.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe sang a second time and a third time.
“The German nuts would make this better,” Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget manager.
Gilead full compensation for attorneys’ fees for patenting C-hepatitis drug with Merck
The U.S. District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to full compensation for attorney’s fees incurred by it in a legal dispute with Merck & Co Inc. regarding the patent for the hepatitis C drug.
In June, Gilead was released from damages of $200 million, which it was ordered to violate two patents owned by Merck in connection with the successful drugs of Gilead Sovaldi and Harvoni. A U.S. judge noticed Merck’s infamous violation of the terms of which he was accused of embezzlement.
Beth Labson Freeman, a judge at the U.S. District Court, said in a complaint filed Thursday that Gilead was entitled to be released from the attorney’s fees it had incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market for the next generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat as many as 90 percent of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other in court and demanded the privacy of the sofosbuvir under the laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is an active substance in Gilead medicines.
U.S.-backed forces have taken control of the city of Manbij from Isis
U.S.-backed forces have seized Manjib, a city near the Turkish border in northern Syria, when the last ISIS fighters left the city, the group said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group has now raided the city to find the last ISIS fighters hidden in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council of the SDF, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages kidnapped by ISIS fighters have been released.
“The city is now fully in our possession, but we are still conducting search operations,” Darwish said.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of federal taxes.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced on Friday her 2015 tax return, which reveals that her and her husband’s income at the time was $10.75 million and that they would pay a real federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in phone rewards, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced a $3 million stipend in her salary, while former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced a $1 million stipend
Clinton's vice president-elect, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine and his wife Anne Holton announced a 10-year tax return.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to serve as a model for economic transparency,” Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
The complete opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and cancels his promises to publish his tax information.
By the way, the U.S. presidential candidates have always made their tax information public, even though the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have called for a tax administration review and say why Trump has not disclosed his income information.
“The move is yours,” Clinton campaigner Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the tax information of the Democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Trump’s special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not let Trump disclose his tax information until the checks are ready.
Trump’s critics, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump’s own capital, his support for the relationship, his ties to the many charities, and his ties to the movement.
Clinton has been caught up in this question and released a video online Friday in which she brings out the Republicans in a prominent position who torture Trump to publicize his tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has been doing for decades, not to make public tax returns,” Clinton told the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump paid no taxes at all or paid only a little over two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted several tax analysts and accountants on Friday that the situation may still be similar.
The federal tax rate has risen to become a key issue in the presidential elections.
Clinton has backed billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s so-called rule, which would ensure that more than a million dollars a year earned would pay at least 30 percent of the tax.
President Barack Obama is also in favour of the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton election rally in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose headquarters of the Berkshire Hathaway corporation is located in the same location, challenged Trump to a meeting where they both revealed their tax information.
Buffett says that he too has been subject to tax administration scrutiny and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authority, but voters.
Clinton’s campaign has been publishing tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid a real federal tax on average of 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate they paid was about 40.5%.
According to the Clintons’ 2015 tax return, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was in wage-earnings.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons announced a total of $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder-filled radioactive condoms in support of protection of elephants in Tanzania
Naturalists in Tanzania have come up with an unusual way to keep the elephants away from human habitation – the elephants are threatened by throwing condoms filled with chili powder towards them.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, has started a campaign with the American organization Nature Conservancy to teach the North Tanzanian villagers how to protect the elephants and how to protect the elephants.
Some time ago, the elephants were used as baits.
Friday is a global day dedicated to the protection of animals.
“As we developed the method, we’ve seen attitudes change in these villages, as now villagers can rely on them to be able to keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them,” Damian Bell, director of the Honeyguide Foundation, said in a statement.
First, the penetrating swan is disturbed by pointing a flashlight and calling the peat.
If this does not work, the so-called chili cloud is thrown out.
The mixed chili powder is placed on the condom along with the ultrasound, after which the head of the condom is rotated so that only the ignition wire remains outside.
When the ignition wire is ignited, the condom explodes open and spreads into the air a fine chili powder cloud.
Usually, a single cloud of spices is enough to drive the elephant out.
The last means is a thrower, which shoots into the air as a Roman candle of joy and gives rise to a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish Filmmaker Criticizes Hotel in Berlin for Removing Israel's Direction Number for Arab 'Enhancement' – RT News
The French, a Jewish film director, gave birth to the media after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not mention Israel’s directional number in its country number list. When asked by the hotel’s staff, the company asked Arab customers to become “proposals”.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Holocaust Shoah document, dismissed his disillusionment with Berlin’s Kempinski Bristol hotel by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
In a recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find the hotel's address list for Israel.
However, it is not mentioned among the countries to which the room can be called directly.
“How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it did not exist?”
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through a separate call centre.
The film director asked for an explanation of the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist’s response surprised him.
The receptionist said that removing Israel from the list was "a decision to carefully consider the management of Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the move further shocked the director of the film.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: “Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel’s address number.”
An Israeli ambassador to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, said the case was "greatly shameful".
“The incident has shocked and shocked all of us.
It's a big shame.
And the more embarrassing it is when we take into account that we are in Germany and it is precisely this hotel chain.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions,” says the Ambassador.
The incident caused quite a backlash online, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply surrendering to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"H<0xC3><0xA4>vetk<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>" was said in a separate publication, which highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes the hotel's controversial charges quickly, calling the incident a mistake, and apologized to Lanzmann.
“A direct order to leave Israel out of the direction number list has never been given,” wrote a spokesman for the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski hotel.
It adds that the trend number has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets at the protest of Brazilian students
The students met with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday, as they gathered to demonstrate their minds against the government’s public education system reforms.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
Melting began when law enforcement authorities tried to break up a student group, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
The event was attended by hundreds of students who wanted to show their enthusiasm for the government’s plans.
The Governor of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed a cost-saving measure that will close nearly 100 public schools and put 300,000 students in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on the walls, where Michel Temer, who served as president, was temporarily opposed.
The students’ comments came just days after the streets were filled with segregated protesters supporting President Dilma Rousseff in the country’s Senate vote on this office.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
After the lifting of sanctions, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9%, Russian Ambassador Levan Dzhagaryan said.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in business in Iran has increased since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran.
“Russian companies continue to have existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Growing trade continues, of course, is one of the primary objectives of cooperation between countries,” says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
Trade accelerated the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Office in Iran granted Iranian citizens about 35,000 visas, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, for the first time, Iran was among the first 20 countries to visit its citizens in Russia.
And it’s not too bold to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia is going to be broken this year,” he said.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, in turn, is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
“I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he says.
Scooter Callum Skinner scored a goal when the British won the wheel of gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner made a name for himself in the men's team sprint at Rio Velodrom last night, when the British three defended the championship they won in London in 2012.
Glasgow-based 23-year-old Skinner was the anchor in the role, which he inherited from his Scottish compatriot Sir Chris Hoyl. The young man made the legend proud by thanking the goal and seizing the victory from the New Zealand team, which was held as a preliminary favourite.
Britain took a surprise win four years ago when Hoy won his fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after they had only placed sixth in the World Cycling Championships held in London in March, despite Hoy having since left his competitive streak.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who specialized in the role of the first drawer.
The price came at just the right time.
Hoy’s decision to end the competition also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was a man that the British coaches believed in and where they saw the potential that he has now redeemed.
Hindes, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, Kenny and Skinner made the Olympic record in time, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British three won gold in a two-fight.
Hindes was left behind after his tour, but Kenny made an effort to lead the team, which Skinner retained.
A big part of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes drove the pace to slow down at a greater rate, thanks to which Kenny and especially Skinner were able to keep pace.
Hoy followed his place as a BBC commentator and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes as they stepped on the podium.
Glasgow-based 23-year-old Skinner says: “I’m amazed at the comparison.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We made the Olympic record in the final and won the World Championships.
It was unbelievable.
There’s no better way to win it.”
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he had fallen on the track due to a bad start.
He later cancelled his speech, and the British competitors had no means of appeal.
This time, there were no such problems associated with the victory of the sovereign.
Hindes says: "The scene was like in London, all the flags of Great Britain fluttered in sight.
Our team has been united over the last three months.
We’ve lost so many world championships that winning the Olympics feels great.”
In other words, one race, one gold medal for the country, which won seven out of ten races in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the last five months, then the five-day bond market is a success.
As Kenny has shown in his ability, it is impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy’s achievements and win three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
This would mean mapping the account with six gold coins and one silver coin to Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyta and was also born on 23 March (the magical date of British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
At that time, the metal additions would be the same as the Hoy.
Kenny will compete in the next sprint, which starts today and resolves in three days.
The 28-year-old said: “At the moment, I can only enjoy this.
Team competition is always the best.
You can enjoy the win together with your friends.
Winning alone is a little lonely.”
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must get the knight's worth."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest four-man team-mate.
Their time was 3:51,943.
The world record, which was made in London in 2012 and won gold, is 3:51,659.
The first round and final (at 22.42) will be contested on the second day of the competition, and the focus will surely be Wiggins.
Yesterday, he had a dispute with the competition officials before the time runs, when the officials invited him to measure his length.
In a similar women’s competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached a world record time of 4:13,260.
The UK team can now count on its great cycling team to take responsibility for the mid- Olympics and bring a bunch of medals to the country.
The expectations of Rio have been under-estimated, following the truly exceptional evidence from the full management station in Beijing and London.
There have been dramas on the back, the least of which is the resignation of technical leader Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and harassment, and the end of major athletes such as Hoyn and Victoria Pendelton's competitions.
However, the competitions held on the first night in Velodrom show that Britain’s already legendary reputation for rising to the top at the perfect moment is once again realized.
The future of Portland's melting pot with a flat sheet due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of an aluminium melting house in Portland, Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers, are on the verge of collapse when a power company supplying electricity to a melting plant said that one of the plant’s owners is cancelling the supply contract and that all supply contracts are expected to be terminated.
This is the result of the decision of the Victorian Government earlier this year not to continue the subsidies with which the plant is kept in operation.
Fixed, 20 years of support will end in November.
The Alcoa Portland plant is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
As many as 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk due to the shutdowns.
The impact of snowballs can continue to grow, as the melting pot consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's dam, which forced the power plant to shut down last year.
Alcoa Portland's melting pot is losing money and is in danger of closing its doors.
The measures are in line with speculations about the future of the plant that have been going on for years, first caused by Australia’s strong dollar and recently the factory’s production price.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects three other smelter owners to also cancel their contract.
The majority ownership of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina. Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own a minority stake in the plant.
AGL says it expects the Portland plant to remain in operation, which means that physical electricity demand for cooling will continue.
The AGL says the contracts are “protective” contracts, which were to come into force in November 2016.
The withdrawal period of the contracts is 12 months, so they end in 2017.
“Therefore, AGL expects the contracts to generate revenue in the financial year 2017,” says the power plant.
The potential return effects on AGL from fiscal year 2018 onwards are currently limiting the strong market outlook for the future in terms of wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL says it has already lowered the value of the contracts in its accounting by $187 million "in anticipation of the termination of the contracts".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... capacity to keep a melting pot in operation or to secure electricity supply to a melting pot".
The American company said it made a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to go into effect as of November this year, although it still needs to find out why it has now withdrawn from the deal.
Due to the weak economic situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious about their assessments of both the meltdown in Portland, Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
AGL’s chief operating officer, Stephen Mikkelsen, told analysts earlier this week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and about 900 megawatts of Tomago at the annual level.
“If these factories leave the market, it means a significant drop in demand in the (electricity) market.
For us as a producer, that would not be good news,” says Mikkelsen.
Kardashian TV star Kendall as Vogue’s cover girl in September
The Kardashian-Jenner clan model and his mother and manager Kristi's fourth daughter Kendall Jenner, 20, owns the famous September issue of Vogue in the United States.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s advertising giant and appeared in fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“Looking at the couch in a room that was full of my loved ones made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The release of the film was followed by a strange (or maybe just a Kardashian series style to follow?), a handwritten video featuring all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (barrels Rob and Caitlyn and everyone’s favorite, the producer of the Kardashian series, the frontman of the film, Ryan the frontman of the show.
The plot is cliché, and it is used in almost all stages of the stage programs’ birthdays (Seacrest says the words: “Did you think we had forgotten you?” as sincerely as the children’s morning TV cartoon character), but Krisin had to get his other daughter in some way in this way.
For the appearance in the September issue of Vogue means, without a doubt, a new era of the Kardashians.
Kendalli's older sister Kim may have been in Vogue's court before (she appeared on Vogue's court with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue is entirely her own.
The September issue is Vogue’s best-selling publication of the year.
With a thicker picture book than a form sheet, the number attracts a large number of advertisers (Fashion’s fashion website estimated that last year’s 832 page tutorial had 615 pages of ads).
The publication of the September issue is so eagerly awaited that, in the previous two years, the newspaper’s images have leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Previously, the cover designs for September have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more celebrities working on the model than models that are celebrities.
The Oscar-winning and Dior-advertising Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, and a year later received the honor of Lady Gaga.
The magazine describes Jenner as a successful model of her generation, and although she would rather be among the celebrities who do the model’s work, she’s in a pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, real TV stars or modern kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (though Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called gifted women who succeed in the entertainment industry above others.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the cover last year, has one of the strongest years of her career, when she released her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
Because of its true TV background, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be supportive.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "the monsters".
These feelings have resurfaced when news of Jenner’s appearance on Vogue’s cover came out.
However, the continued suppression of dissatisfaction seems to be irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
She's walking Marc Jacobs fashion shows.
He's the advertising face of Estee Lauder's makeup.
He and all his sisters sell photos of themselves through paid apps.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she described in LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, he appears on real TV, maybe just as a way to meet his sister and this kid.
The Centres of Legal Aid turn away 160,000 people a year
Every year, more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people in the country are turned away from law enforcement, and the sector is preparing for the effects that additional cuts in funding will have on centres already operating at the border.
In Queensland, those seeking free legal assistance and legal services are being turned away from five of the already three people, most of whom are elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified dismissals and similar human injustices.
Public legal aid services, whose workload has already been overloaded, are preparing for additional cuts in appropriations.
Starting in June next year, law enforcement agencies are in danger of losing another 30 per cent of federal funding.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, says that thousands of people are being turned away from the centres every year, according to the latest report from the National Legal Aid Centres.
If the federal government does not reverse its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s public advocacy centres are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people are being turned away when they apply for the services they need,” Farrell says.
“People who leave violent relationships, people who are under an uncontrollable and crippling debt cycle, families who are separating, workers who are unreasonably fired – all have problems with legal issues, and this report shows that they are not able to get the necessary help.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30 percent as of June 2017, which means that thousands of Queensland's weakest will have to deal with complex legal problems without assistance.
We appeal to the Chancellor of Justice and to the Senator of Queensland, George Brand, so that these financial transactions are immediately handed over, so that people can get the legal assistance they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national middle level.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of public aid centres and their client communities, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump’s campaign was raised against the threat of an employee with a weapon
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was raised when no action was allegedly taken after its leadership was told that the leader of the campaign had threatened an employee with a gun while they were driving in Jeep in February.
The event is described in a complaint filed by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign, at the state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bordini says he waited months for the situation to be dealt with inside the campaign before he realized in his own words that this would not happen.
Bordini said in a statement that campaign leader Earl Phillip "put out a gun, put his right front finger on the move and pressed the pipe on Vincent's knee."
According to the complaint to the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordini was told that at least four other people had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
"Even if the gun doesn't fire, it will cause damage," Bordini said in a statement.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a general rage when he told the crowd in North Carolina that “the supporters of another extra-barrel” – including gun owners and gunners – can take action if Hill is allowed to respond.
According to Trump’s campaign staff, the media took his words out of context and Trump did not say he encouraged violence.
During his campaign, Bordini is demanding compensation for the indifference of the cause and for Phillip’s treatment, abuse, and the spiritual suffering they cause.
Trump’s spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not immediately respond to a message asking for comment.
Phillip wasn't hit, despite the efforts.
Charlotte's local news agency WCCB reported Phillip had just left the campaign.
There was no immediate response to the call request made to Phillip's consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.

Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow's
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates well-being – not just in local communities and in London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was one of the things that I was most interested in in in Heathrow, and like the 2012 London Olympics, we invested a lot in making sure that our entire nation and our entire region benefited from it.
The Olympians made huge gains for Stratford and the East End.
We are doing this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we are creating 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs, eliminating youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
As at the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who think the expansion of Heathrow is too big a challenge.
As for the Olympics, I was told that Britain will never be ready for them and that we are in a sad situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong about Heathrow.
Winning obstacles will always be met, but Heathrow will answer every question it asks.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is also an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and increase the economy by <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion, bringing skills and employment to both the airport environment and the UK as a whole.
We have a great working group at Heathrow, which has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment programme on time and budget, which included the T5 terminal – voted the best flight terminal of the year for two consecutive years – and the toughest one for the T2 terminal each year.
Now they are ready to produce a third thank you road, which is supported by a private investment of <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that there will also be an extension of Heathrow.
“It is time to use the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee our trade for the future and create the skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Government of Heathrow and the former Secretary of Commerce of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Ad Show on Cat Mouse Games
Efforts by companies earning money from online advertising to fool advertising entertainment software have turned into a cat-mouse game, says one company that produces stop-programs.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook had announced on its website that it was blocking its adware programs, Adblock Plus released a blog post in which it reported that users can update their blocking software filters and thus again block community service ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change its desktop site’s ad tag codes to make it harder to identify which parts of the page are ads.
Adblock, however, says it has uncovered new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in his blog post that “such a bottling between the open source advertising community and fraudsters has been going on since the ad show was invented” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon be making its own remediation move.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how much concern advertisers have formed in the industry.
Globally, an estimated 200 million people use adware software, according to a study conducted by Pagefair and Adobe last year. The number has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook uses 1.03 million active users per day on mobile devices, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company plans to invest in misleading adware on its desktop application, as it says that mobile ad blocking programs do not work on Facebook’s mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from desktop ads is still large enough, which is why Facebook considered the bet profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also announced that it is updating its user settings advertising tool so that users can more control how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock’s new filters, saying they also prevent some of the usual Facebook posts from showing up.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
“Advertising programs are cumbersome and ineffective, and that’s why we’ve instead invested in developing user settings like ad tools so people can control the targeting of ads themselves.”
Woman Committed Suicide by Leaving Cars Under Swiss Motorway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling for the help of eyewitnesses on the highway on Thursday in the first hours of the accident, in which the woman was deliberately left under several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vaudi near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did a desperate act by setting herself on a dark road, and she was hit by several cars, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and her aim was clearly to commit suicide. Among the surviving cars was also a truck.
The woman died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the car drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some of them have not yet been identified.
Attorney Gilles Hofstetter reports in the newspaper Le Tribune de Geneve that the criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a logical step in this situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether charges are being brought against the drivers involved in the accident.
"Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecution to find out," Hofstetter said.
In the last five years, there have been two similar cases on the basis of which drivers are not considered responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, the person walked on a dark highway and the court ruled that the drivers could not wait to hit their pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police were acquitted of a charge that had been raised against him over the death of a man who was lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on one August night in 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had enjoyed a lot of alcohol and walked away.
The court found that the police – who were responding to an emergency call – had justified driving and that the man lying on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation”.
Any information regarding the accident near Morges on Thursday is requested to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) has developed a model that allows the past of Venus to be studied with the same tools and algorithms that climate scientists use.
The purpose of the model was to find out whether the conditions on Venus could at times be similar to those on Earth, even though Venus is hot and waterless on its surface and its gas vapor consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide.
According to previous research, the slow rotational speed of Venus is explained by its thick gas bubble.
However, based on the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere, and it has nevertheless rotated slowly.
The model was also used to investigate the early surface formation of Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographic variation to sustain life and prevent rapid extinction.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimer.
“In the GISS model, Venus rotates slowly and its daytime half is almost two months at a time per sun,” GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This heats the surface and generates rain, which creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer acts as a rain cover and protects the surface from the heat of the sun for the most part.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are even a few degrees lower than Earth’s current temperatures.
With the help of the model, the story of Venus was created, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of planetary researchers about its cost of development.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and the ultraviolet light burned the steamed water.
Only a thick carbon dioxide-containing gaseous and deadly greenhouse effect remained in the karate of Vedyn, i.e. Venus, as it is today.
The researchers reported the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice-chairman of the ice hockey team, citing a lack of influence in the team's decision-making.
Joe Sakic, Colorado’s deputy chief executive officer/chief executive officer, confirmed the news and announced that the company will immediately start applying for a new coach.
“For the past three years, I have been serving as the Colorado Avalanche team’s head coach and vice president of ice hockey,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
“Over the summer, I’ve been thinking long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the Vice-President of the ice hockey activities of the coach and the team must be on exactly the same lines as the organization.
He must also have the say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not met at the moment.”
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick told me about his decision today,” Sakic says.
“We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the best for the future.”
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach of the year from his first term as head coach of Avalanche 2013–2014.
He led the team to 112 points and won the central division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the fall games and has not been able to continue for the past two years.
Avalanche scored 39–39–4 in the 2015–2016 season and stayed five points away from the Minnesota Wild while playing for second place Wild Card at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career – two in the Montreal Canadiens and two in the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and cut off the strike
The main negotiators report that the wages of the North Sea oil workers will be cut off when all the parties to the dispute participate in the new round of negotiations.
Wood Group, which offers oilfield services, has been held against the drilling rigs under the control of Royal Dutch Shell, located in the North Sea.
According to a joint statement by the parties, "Wood Group and the trade unions Unite and RMT confirm their agreement to restart the process in order to resolve the dispute".
From the beginning of next week, we will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will deal with problems from fresh points of view.
Trade unions argued for their recent activity, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut the tariffs of its contractors operating in the North Sea by around 9% this year.
The reduction in the company’s tariffs follows the calculation of the prices of contractors working in the countries by 10 % in 20114.
According to the company, additional cuts give it the mobility space it needs in order to cope with the downward trend in the market.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of employees from its payrolls and announced plans to leave oil and gas drilling operations in up to 10 countries, aiming to streamline its operations after its mega-future with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June are putting pressure on energy companies.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with Labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour cuts that have been experienced in the North Sea for a whole generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the region’s economy.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that benefits many, not just the few,” Anderson said.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to spend less than $1.4 billion in 2016, with approximately $7 billion spent over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiadian constellation
The Kepler space telescope’s newest task has been to measure the rotational speed of stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiadian constellation so far.
Based on new data, astronomers are able to find out why stars in the same star cluster rotate at different speeds, and how orbiting times are related to planetary formation.
“We hope that by comparing the results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between star weight and age and even the history of its solar system,” Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at Pasadena, said in a press release.
The Pleiades star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars of the constellation have been born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are just reaching their adults.
They are running faster now than ever before.
When the rotational speed is at its peak, the adult stars dissipate in large quantities from the stellar wind.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they move through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of the recognizable starspots (which correspond to the sunspots).
The most recent listed rotational speed data suggests that the larger stars are rotating slower than the smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers – larger ones rotate slower than smaller ones.
“We see from Pleiades’ ‘dance’ that slowly rotating is typically larger, while the fastest rotating is typically very light stars,” says Rebull.
Because the Pleiadian star cluster is so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory that allows the properties of stars to be compared in relation to rotational speeds.
“The Pleiadian Star Team provides a support pillar for theoretical models dealing with the rotations of both younger and older stars,” says Rebull.
We want to get a lot more information about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation speed and stop their "dance".
Rebull’s colleagues will present their latest analysis of Pleiades’ rotational speeds in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
