Let your imagination go.
All right, how about you?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove it?
You can't go into that room.
What did you do to me?
It's all here.
Why me?

Could I have a hug? - No.

It doesn't look like you.
She has achieved her goal.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
Madness has crossed the line.
Isn't that black?
This isn't a children's book.
You're absolutely right.
Come, sit next to me.
We know we're better than that.
Like I don't know!
Let's not talk about this now.
Have fun.
Time to break up.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I think it's a waste of time.

I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
What am I doing here?
Tom will understand.
These girls are very busy.
Give us some space.

Fish, please.
I think I'm fat.
I think we were lucky.
Don't talk.
Did you learn French at your school?
Let's have a drink with me.

Mom, I'm hungry.
I'm not going to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
This one usually turns on.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
I locked the bike.
Now, let's talk about our sponsor.
I'm hardly satisfied with the situation.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad we're here.
Stay calm.
I'm armed.
Tom can't stand it.
Our eyes can't see infrared rays.
It's time to sleep.
Tom's very intelligent.
Can I replace this?
Tom wanted to have a nicer cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring a fennel?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know the reason.
How are you feeling?
Everyone tells me I'm weird.
Bitcoin and Ethereum are virtual currencies.
It's all very cheap.

Stupid and not alone while I'm eating.
You look fat.
Learning a language is not easy.
Does your head hurt?
You have to learn English step by step.
It's better now than it used to be.
Tom and Mary are different as heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for an opinion on who would win the race.
A man has many desires that he does not really want to fulfill and it would even be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment for him. One of such desires is the desire for eternal life, the desire for evil is the desire for eternal life.
Water is a liquid.
Does Tom really speak French?
I can't trust him.
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car myself.
She takes care of her old mother.
Italy is far from Brazil.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.
My wife's father is my girlfriend.
I want to live in the city.
Tom and I just wrote a couple of books together.
I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
The news has arrived.
No one really wants us.
They all paid.
Be careful.
Yogurt is made from milk and cream.
I'm alone.
All right, what about you?
Don't drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
That was just the beginning.
The book is sold out.
The price of gold is changing every day.
Be nice.
Turn around!
Tom got married.
I could come with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
He's a scientist.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is it interesting to take pictures of trains?
I hope you like it.
Welcome back.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a fool.
We can't go back.
I'll take a shower.
What are you planning to do this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Can anything be more romantic?
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry.
We'll announce the job.
It's time for the truth.
It's none of our business.
Do you like costumes?
Why are you asking?
I saw Mark's house.
At least you're honest.
It's really pretty bad.
Thank you all for that.
You wouldn't follow us.
You too, Brut?
The house where Atat<0xC3><0xBC>rk was born in Thessaloniki.
People are wrong.
It's snowing.
I thought you needed help.
Does this make sense?
I like your goggles.
He was elected president.
He has two cars.
That was three months ago.
I know your name.
Let's hear your excuse.
Dad said no.
They've formed a swimming team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging. Keep digging.
Tom jumped up and down.
Tom's dog was lying down.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
You taught us that.
Oh, no.
Go find something else to do.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
You're not gonna leave me, are you?
Don't overdo it.
I can't approve this project. There are a lot of shortcomings.
You're sending a message to Mary?
I'll save you a spot in the first order.
Mary pushes her children to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to bring my pen back.
Small flowers blooming at night.
I counted up to two hundred.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
One day you should try it.
I'll stay home with Grandma and Grandpa for the weekend.
What's your conclusion?
I prayed for you.
No, that's all.
Come to my house.
Tom's on the edge of the ribs.
The bathroom is upstairs.
It's Christmas tomorrow.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
Tom reads a lot.
It's just a few minutes from here.
What do you know about me?
He wants to work in the hospital.
I'm not saying anything.
I got off the bus.
You're an average student.
As a child, many violent criminals have been ruthlessly tortured by animals.
I'm going to live in Cambodia.
How long are you gonna be angry and yell at us?
Please, stop here.
How important is that?
Shall we have an aperitif?
Tom's constantly complaining.
If you want, I'll teach you how to play ukulele.
I'm used to it.
It's not that bad.
Looks like she was offended by what he said to her.
I love to listen to music written by my friends.
Tom admitted it.
I've been there twice.
Works speak more than words.
Is this where Tom sits?
That's enough!
It's hard to work with you.
Tom grew up.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
It's my fault.
Don't answer.
Bring wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me the pictures!
A few old houses need to be demolished.
What did you do?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom sat down at the party.
I'm so tired I can't learn.
I've never seen his face.
Tom's very observant.
When are you going to go?
This report isn't written very well.
I want a new bike.
He said that the government's latest move has a lot of significance.
They say love is blind.
Tom arrived this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
Tom didn't answer.
Five brothers worked together on a farm.
It could be a trick.
The company is known for its high quality products.
Don't forget to wash your sunscreen.
Tom didn't try to deny Merin's conviction.
Tell me what this is.
Thank you for accepting my request for a friend on Facebook.
His hair covered almost all of his face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh largest country in the world.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean the snow off the roof?
I'll owe you.
Why is he here?
A student from Oslo who faked his diploma to enroll in the faculty was sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish I could have thought of that.
Tom made a vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You were really good to me.
I will finish by reading this book.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not an essay problem, it's all these murderous questions and explanations that drive me terribly mad!
It's the weekend.
I'll be back next week.
It looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
I really want to see her.
It was a stroke of luck.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
Did you get the package I sent you?
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
He began to scream.
I'll be there when I finish my homework.
Clean up a bit.
Can I use your dictionary?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people love chicken.
Did Tom go crazy?
I didn't do that either.
Are you ready?
Let's take a look again.
The last time I went to the beach, I was severely burned.
Get back on your feet.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Be careful here, Tom.
We fixed some damage caused by throwing stones at your car.
I retired after 40 years of working in the office.
Why are you suddenly curious?
His girlfriend didn't give him any support.
I just took a bath.
Do you doubt me?
Fortunately, Tom wasn't seriously injured.
In general, children love sweets.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've had enough.
You scared us.
Are you ready for more?
Just try.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try your way.
Tom decided to take a day off.
How could I resist?
Gold is much heavier than water.
The phone is a wonderful device.
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car myself.
One language is never enough.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
This is the address.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm self-confident.
I don't believe it.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
What would Tom think?
We're not getting into it.
It happens to everyone before or after.
That's my question.
Hold on, Tom.
Tom's definitely got a thicker end.
Follow me.
I don't care what your name is.
He's got no balance.
It's all right with me.
Apparently, Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve. Then I was interested in languages, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so, it’s time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the melody of that song.
I'm Ricardo.
I need an honest girl.
She's a beginner.
Are they still here?
I'm sure I'm gonna miss Tom a lot.
Tom's not gonna run.
I'd go.
I'm getting a myth.
Down! Down!
Tom couldn't stand it.
Anything you remember can help.
You'll be better in a few days.
What language do you speak?
It's not something to worry about.
I realize they're a thorn in the eye like you, but this is just crap.
Tom's gonna make it.
There is no free lunch.
And what if I'm a homosexual?
Anyway, he'll definitely come.
Please leave this place as clean as you would like to find it.
We'll go through the jungle somehow.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
We can only do so much.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
That's your life.
What's your name?
I get it.
We were lucky, weren't we?
She's crying.
I'm sorry.
Stop the self-pity.
He'll be done soon.
You learn by doing.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
The police are chasing me.
Have you seen anyone there?
Either way, you're not right.
She won't take it.
There is no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
There are all kinds of flowers in the garden.
No one said anything.
The book is on the table.
He is a true aristocrat.
I'm doing my job.
Everything's quiet again.
I didn't make it.
We know.
Tom goes to school for graphic design.
He lied to you.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unhappy.
Music is his passion.
You're supposed to face reality.
The light waves pass through space and various materials.
We managed to escape on time.
I've had enough.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
Carthage must be destroyed!
How much does it cost?
I want to talk to Tom about it.
We have some options.
You should put it on.
She hated him.
As far as I'm concerned, I'm not against your opinion.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens that way.
Take a minute.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
I've been starving since I ran.
I'm a translator.
It was hot in every sense of the word.
Catch me naked.
He's talking about others so he'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused that he didn't even know what question to ask.
Are you ready?
Find Tom.
I think it's okay.
What do you think?
You changed my life.
Somehow we're going to go through the jungle.
Reaction is not always the best way to act.
I'm not gonna tell anyone you did that.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who have complained should be compensated with a proportional share of the annual interest fee.
Tom bought the time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory it is possible, but in practice it is very difficult.
I don't have time to write.
It's time to get up.
It was almost worth it.
Please, send me your picture.
That's my money, too.
Anyhow, it's over.
Tom's devastated.
Remember the name of the file before you try to perform a return of deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom ran down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
Only a vodka from Russia is a real Russian vodka!
I wasn't nervous about it.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
We won't let you die.
A lot of things go hand in hand.
Tom wants to teach his children the importance of work.
Tom has always been a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Is it yours?
Tom is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much do I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It's happening.
How long do you think Tom's been preparing for the exam?
A book that describes the wonders of nature.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to throw stones in a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
He breathed out.
I tried to persuade Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
You can't touch it.
Not the vaccinates.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
Mary is a retired nurse.
I'm not going to watch TV tonight.
Did Tom pull a thicker end?
Give me all the money.
Mer was a great supporter.
Those are nice shoes.
The girl sees the boy.
We call Robert "Bob."
It is very difficult, almost impossible, to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
They're teachers.
The government fell after the vote in parliament.
You're not funny.
Tom went instead of Mary.
The candle is not yours, it is his.
It just happened here.
He was driving a car down the street.
I don't know Latin very well.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I don't speak Japanese.
He didn't understand anything.
I'm waiting for my turn.
That's not the main question.
I was shocked by the news.
The girl eats bread.
I don't speak English.
You're not the one who died.
Would you rather have tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
I'm a woman.
Tom asked for help.
It's not like that.
They know you.
I took every test.
What are you going to do today?
What's on your mind?
I'll kill you!
I was cold as a sprayer.
There is no point in just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right away.
Here's the key from my apartment.
It's an area with a lot of new homes.
I can't believe all this.
I could go, but I didn't want to.
Yesterday it was snowing.
We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a spare key in his garden.
Let's pretend we're aliens.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I got off at the wrong bus station.
I wrote this song just for you.
Your house, your libertarian.
Have you read the Bible?
And if I were rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
Are we safe now?
Stop it!
We've been teaching all afternoon.
Will you send this as an e-mail?
What are you suggesting?
It is said that love is blind.
I don't have a home today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
The room is dark.
Come on, give it to me.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was beautiful.
For some strange people, the knowledge of a language is kept secret.
I'm not going to change.
They slowly moved forward.
Why is love so hard?
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
I'm late, aren't I?
Don't blink.
It's blue for you.
Come visit us soon.
Have you been in an accident?
What are you and Tom doing?
Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was an honorable man.
My dad doesn't like football.
I don't know if I'll have time.
I went there voluntarily.
We're all out of alcohol.
Card, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
There was something on the ground.
Children are the flowers of our lives.
Why are we laughing?
My friend lives with God behind his feet.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
She yelled at him, but he didn’t hear.
Water is life.
What are you gonna do today?
He will win the championship on his own.
After the silence, what most accurately expresses inexplicably, is music.
Tom looks like a banker.
It's Tom.
It's not over until it's over.
Tom's still looking worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Where's the vodka?
Tom doesn't have that kind of problem.
You can't hide secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You're having a hard day.
It's okay.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I won't participate.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully satisfied.
Tom and Mary would be a beautiful couple.
How to say XXX in Dutch?
Don't work too much!
I was so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always behave rationally.
I didn't even do that.
Did you take the exam?
We're on the bus, we're gonna have to walk now.
I'll set you free.
I wholeheartedly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
What would it be like to create a group on Facebook so that we can discuss learning foreign languages?
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Did we agree?
It's not that scary.
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Stop smoking.
Tom went there.
You owe me an apology.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom used to scare me.
Tom whispered something to Mary, and she smiled.
But why?
May I look at your card?
What will happen now?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
They've installed a library of new books.
It's clean.
How about some chocolate cheese?
Today is your daughter's birthday.
Will someone tell me what to do?
It's obviously a mistake in cooking.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
Tom wouldn't be happy.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
A cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It's pointless to call during a student's life.
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom's got bad hair.
I've seen enough so far.
I hate that one.
We'll miss you a lot if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's going to happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom's gonna look.
Tom ate a sandwich.
Here's what I think.
I want to go.
I could go with you.
The cost of living is growing.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you deactivate the bomb?
I think Tom could do it.
I need five more minutes.
He's sleeping like a baby.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples that Tom gave her to make an apple butter.
How many songs did you write?
Where's your head?
We're glad to have you here.

Don't be in a hurry.
She's a Thai.
You can learn, regardless of your age.
He dedicated his life to realizing the vision of what he wanted to create for himself and others.
Did you give it to Tom?
Who have you been helping lately?
Just close your eyes.
She doesn't like football.
Tom's a little worried.
He is the best student in the class.
How is this your fault?
My phone number is 9876-5432.
Why don't you just tell Tom?
How did I manage this?
This is a sentence.
Life is sweet.
That's my cat.
What should I write here?
I am deeply ashamed.
My father bought me a book.
I'm flexible.

Lose.
I'm ready, bro.
Please, shut up as hard as you can.
This fish is big.
Follow me, sugar, please.
It's nice to be needed by someone.
I hope we'll figure this out.
We all have to face this.
Where's the toothpaste?
Mrs. Klein is in her 80s, but she's still very active.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
Trust me.
This is my computer.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
We know enough.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired I can barely keep my eyes open.
Spinning's fun.
It's never too late to learn.
Give me the sugar, please.
Come quickly!
Cover your mouth while coughing, sneezing or sneezing.
Where did you find the keys?
Have you ever switched the video to YouTube?
I was very interested in participating in building a more intensive academic plan for programming.
Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Tom gave me a few books.
Don't let Tom find out.
I can't wait for Monday.
Have you been here before?
Do you have any experience with Tom?
I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
"What did Tom see?"
How much is this umbrella?
I'm burning on her.
Tom did his homework in the kitchen.
I could kill you now.
Mary used walking sticks to help her with the ups and downs on the trip.
Smoke my dick.
The compass points to the north.
Don't talk.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
On whose initiative was this done?
Finish this.
Which one should I take?

Tom has an older brother, John.
I'd take it.
Humans are complicated organisms.
They'll know what to do.
Why did you keep quiet all the time?
He's gone.
He saw Leila's reaction.
I have a laptop.
Can I ask you a favor?
He ran away.
It was fun to celebrate together.
I'm afraid I've dislocated my right shoulder.
Come on!
You really need to take a shower.
What is the purpose of life?
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Mayuko was avoiding a hard job.
She has short hair.
Drive the pole.
My right hand was numb.
I don't know almost anything about you.
Did you do anything?
You taught us that.
You can't talk to her.
You should probably talk a little bit more slowly.
Happy Mother's Day!
I need a beer.
You're not funny.
All Henry's prices.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Is this happening often?
A little bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
I feel safe with you.
Lud!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You should talk to me.
The president opened the meeting.
It just wasn't our day.

We'll try your way.
It's good.
You deserve to be congratulated.
I miss you so much.
Since the message was in French, it was easy to read.
This might get a little sick.
They can speak a little Spanish.
Finish this.
Tom tried to answer Mary's question.
Can you give me some water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll learn more carefully.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
Is the world unfair?
None of us have seen Tom do that.
Do you love your mother?
I'm Tom's grandfather.
And you wonder why we can't stand your company?
The more I know people, the more I admire dogs.
You mistyped my name.
You're different.
Tom can't stay.
Shame on her.
I have two cats.
There were about a thousand people.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
His girlfriend didn't give him any support.
I had dinner with him.
I didn't care.
Some of them were and still are in constant danger because of political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I don't think the internet is a place for kids.
That was hard for me.
The teacher gave me the longest chapter.
What did you conclude?
You're made for me.
He needs it.
It's obviously a tippelier.
Are we done?
Is he seeing me?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom was at Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a shrink.
Check it out.
I'm tired, but I'm fine.
The butter is made of milk.
Tell her.
I'd take it.
You're my luck.
Waiting for the bus.
Bad things will happen.
You're fighting.
A few trees fell during a storm in our neighborhood.
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before.
They all laughed.
I didn't know you were so rich.
We listened carefully so that we didn't miss a single word.
Do you have trouble understanding what women or small children are telling you?
Looks like Cathy likes music.
He refused to comment.
Imagine yourself in my place.
Can you prove it?
We're trying.
I'm giving up.
You disappointed me.
Tom looked angry.
Don't overdo it.
Oh, yes, I'll have work tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
I'm sorry.
I haven't been home all day.
I'd be grateful if you stayed until tomorrow.
I'm sure they need you.
He's everything, he's just not honest.
The bullet blew up the helmet.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think my writing is going very well.
He is no longer a member of this club.
Show me the pictures!
That helps us a lot.
I filled a glass.
I'm not picky.
How many aunts and uncles do you have?
That morning, Mary visited the village.
The sound quickly spread.
Am I so different?
Tom took out the keys and opened the door.
Heather believes me.
I just got here.
I played with Tony last night.
What he did helped a lot.
I know him well.
Without the tool there is no craft.
I've never noticed that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not worried at all.
It helps.
Dima slept with 25 men in one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I'm sure you two will agree.
I hope I'm not the only one who's going to be there.
Are you mad about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
That's why I'm so uncomfortable.
We are from Russia.
The cost will soon increase.
I work at a language school.
Was I really that happy?
It might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar to me.
It's always been that way.
I'll go to sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Heads of people can speak in sign language.
Jane's lying sick in bed.
I'm warning you!
Tom's gonna call.
I had dinner with her.
You see everything in black.
My car wasn't good enough.
Do they doubt me?
What do you have to do?
Cows give milk.
Tom likes to drive.
I've been looking for you.
I'm a woman.
It's all important.
They couldn't travel because there was a problem.
The whole country is worried about it!
Winter's over, spring's over.
Which way are you going?
It's really that simple.
With such a price, your product will not survive competition in the Japanese market.
I met your dad yesterday.
Since these papers had been written about the fact that no farmer wants to work as a contractor in Westfold, interest has increased rapidly.

We're a little busy here.

It's for my friend.
They don't speak English.
We're lost, aren't we?
We won't let you die.
Did you go to see Tom?
What's that?
He surrendered.
I can't wait forever.
This is the beginning of a new era.
America is a big, friendly dog in a small room, and every time he bites his tail, he knocks down a chair.
I don't have a card.
The doctor works in the hospital.
Nothing's happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You will be known.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Welcome to Tatoeba.
Everything's different.
What's your Bosnian name?
The truth must be told.
Look at how much it is!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorbike.
Is your car blue?
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
He lied to you.
How many mosques are there in Istanbul?
He was late for the accident.
For breakfast, I always eat fruits and veggies.
You think I'm a dictator?
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom let us know he doesn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest that the water quality is checked once a year in pipes, twice in wells.
Dear God, it's really hard for people to pay attention to one thing or another about you, your attitudes or your appearance, for example.
Don't be late.
What did you say?
Tom could have done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I'm thrown into a big mess.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of dogs barking.
Are they still here?
Tom hasn't written to Mary in a long time.
This story tells us interesting facts.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Can I just stop you for a second?
I hate science.
The students didn't know how to respond.
Do you have a book?
He has two cars.
If you don't bother them, they won't bother you either.
Good intentions are important.
I've been thinking about it.
Men remain children for the rest of their lives.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
Come on, admit it.
The two of us are so different.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.
I'm just looking around.
Where is the beach?
Do you want to know something specific?
Welcome back.
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
I'm tired.
You don't have to tell me twice.
Interactivity is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I have no idea.
Tom was seriously injured in the accident.
Two-thirds of the students attended the meeting.
My mother is not like any other mother.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
That can't be true.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You open the door.
That's good.
Who's Tom, is that your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
Don't give me that gun, I don't want to do that.
How did I miss this?
I'm relieved.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he was going to do it.
Look again.
Do you speak French?
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters consider Maria to be the most suitable candidate for the new leader, but Tom will not vote in this election.
I bought flowers.
I'm sure you'll have a good time.
She came back from the hospital.
I probably won't read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
He asked me to help him.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
What's going to happen now?
I brought a cup of coffee.
Make a place.
He is also very well known in Australia.
Someone called.
Be careful.
Winter is a time of snow.
Under what name?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
Good morning, how are you?
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful with your wishes, maybe they will happen to you.
Tom is a third year student.
Who will come with us?
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
Who are you really?
As it happened, so it happened.
Give him time.
Who's waiting, wait.
I have to say, yes.
We've never been apart.
I'm 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
What the hell is that?
The doctor examined her thoroughly.
At that moment, it exploded with a big bang.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91 percent of Norway's population is supplied with drinking water from surface sources.
It's his, isn't it?
What's she drinking?
Those are artificial tears.
Tom is very rude.
Don't forget to write a date.
She doesn't speak English.
Clean up this mess.
Could you have read that?
Try again.
That's perfectly normal.
How's your life?
It is said that a new restaurant was built.
The price of this book is $5.
I want a sword like this.
Can you keep secrets?
Tell her.
I assumed you were busy.
Move quietly.
When the fire broke out, he was sleeping a lot.
My older sister sings well.
I never thought of that.
Her childhood illness made her blind.
Some friends can't be replaced.
Although there is a lot of speculation about this phenomenon, there may be evidence to support it in the future.
Quiet down there.
Tom explained it in detail, but I still don't understand.
I'm from Croatia.
I want some cheese.
You wouldn't like that.
I'm gonna have to change my habits.
I met your father yesterday.
I'm really curious.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom parked twice.
Can you speak Latin?
Will you help me?
Good morning, how are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Come back.
What are you going to do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Everyone has the right to the protection of moral and material interests arising from any scientific, literary or artistic work of which he is the creator.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands at sea.
I've never had trouble falling asleep.
Tom's hiding under the table.
I didn't see anything.
How many books can I take at once?
She went out for a walk.
Is there any other options?
The amount for the work done and interest on the invested capital was several million.
Champagne, please.
I can't wait to see you tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
I am the one who pays.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
The three of them laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I've got to get a drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't completely agree with you.
It's a nice day today.
Are you saving this place for someone?
How are you these days?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I really think we women have an extra feeling.
The week has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Will you come to Tom and Merina's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
Croatia is a country in the southeastern part of Europe.
I'll be back late.
You're a little liar.
The sea has risen, the sea of men.
I'll send a letter to my brother living in Sapporo.
The politician had sticky fingers, as 5% of every contract ended in his pocket.
I'll stay with the baby if you want to go.
I don't read novels.
I thought it was my job.
I'm a professor.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked him what he was reading.
There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear what Tom hated us for.
I don't want any passports.
Where do you live?
It's been a long time since I sent someone a letter.
What is the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't argue.
Did you write a report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
Can you go, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
American English is no better than British English.
Tom works about nine hours incessantly.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
You're right.
They couldn't hear what Tom said.
Why would I want everything to kill you?
Tom decided to sell the car.
I'll take a shower.
I'm happy.
It's mine, not his.
We have four hours of French every week.
Let's start now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Fadil demanded that Dani give him the money.
It's our only hope.
I got up on my left leg today.
He broke into my house.
The bathroom is upstairs.
She took care of her son.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It is a typical Gothic church.
It was a presentation that pleased the audience.
Let me show you why you don't have to do that.
Is this your notebook?
Somehow we survived.
Tom didn't practice.
Thank you very much!
Keep the mess.
It's 15 to two.
I think you should do the test again.
Why would Tom give up?
Europeans gained an advantage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
It seemed to me that Tom wasn't doing what he was supposed to do.
I'll pray for your family.
Tom threw out the flies.
He suddenly stopped smoking.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
Tom asked Mary to disprove what she said.
I have a cat and a dog, the cat is black and the dog is white.
Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The girl's on the table.
That makes me very angry.
Is it still light out there?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the edge.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
Don't thank me.
I assumed you were busy.
Do you agree?
Would you like me to look at your house?
You have to control yourself.
What's the difference?
I recognized him at first sight.
The French are our friends.
That's very nice of you.
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what does that have to do with you?
I wish I could have thought of that.
I'm drinking milk.
Tom was able to get into the house through the window.
I've seen the macaws.
She doesn't speak English.
I've seen the macaws.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom comes back safely.
I have no idea what was going on in his head, so he refuses such a favorable proposal.
I just got up.
How's it feel?
Can you laugh at Tom?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom's strict or fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us ate with potato salad.
Come alone.
To be a good child, you need to go to bed and get up early.
All right, how about you?
I mean going abroad.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised.
My family goes to Italy every year.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be lazy.
It was supposed to be like this.
I eat a lot of meat.
I don't like to work.
Tom's a scoundrel.
The future looks bleak for Edmond Dantes, having become the victim of a conspiracy, he is convicted of treason and sent to prison for life.
You're irrational.
My French is shit.
We kind of survived.
She covered her disappointment with a smile.
My mother chose this curtain.
We're not as rich as we'd like.
It's a hit.
Can you tell Tom I'm back?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
You need one of these.
Is he a teacher?
Can you cook?
He loves sports.
I learned French by myself.
I like to walk.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak point.
You're one of us.
Faith can move mountains.
One leg is in the grave.
Tom just told me the other way around.
Louder!
He was two years younger than me.
I'm compassionate.
Tom's unhappy.
That would be a pleasure.
It's crazy when it comes to power.
I'm sorry I didn't respond to your letter earlier.
Do not drink water from a dirty glass!
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today, I wrote.
That doesn't scare me at all.
We didn't play well.
How old are you really?
Someone's here.
Tom asked me if I was sleeping at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
Here are her pictures.
How can I forget those days?
I'm thirsty.
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Who's your favorite wrestler?
Nice to meet you.
I didn't want to hurt you.
This place looks a lot different from what it used to be.
Is it yours?
Why Are Rabbit Ears Big?
I'm a runner.
I don't sing.
Souls don't exist.
I want to help.
I know how to do this.
I shot a bear.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's a real idiot.
Yeah.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's a pretty big problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
I love this song.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to fix things on the go.
You're working too hard, sit down and rest a little.
This one's really cool.
Nobody's talkin'.
I really enjoyed it.
You can trust that somewhere.
You're a teacher.
I bought a lot of stuff.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Ked.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
Sorry, I'm late for the session.
What we need is a responsible government, and what we have is a circus.
I'm sorry I tried it at all.
That river's looking shallow, isn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this composition.
It's five o'clock in the morning in Brazil.
Tom announced that Mary was going to do it.
Is this your phone?
We hate Tom.
This one's really cool.
Tom cut the tape.
Do you think the situation will improve?
Who is she?
Tom was arrested three times.
This isn't so much fun.
That's a big secret.
Mary said she would uncover the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
It's not taught in school.
Is it clean?
Don't let me get out of here tonight.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Fish can't live outside the water.
I have a book.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
Stop resisting!
I'm cold.
I'm so busy I can't help you.
I have two colors.
Move, move!
Please, wait a little longer.
I'm not gonna do that!
I'm tired of arguments.
Are you a maniac?
What was your day like?
What am I looking for here?
They're good people.
She's a singer.
I love watching you play.
Every part!
I'm trying.
I was definitely lucky.
What was the first song you ever wrote?
Tom might be able to resist.
I just want to bow down.
Dania continued to follow Fadil's example.
A large number of words are borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm mad at Tom.
Every other day Bill goes fishing.
Don't let it get away with such a good chance.
What time do you have breakfast?
Be careful.
It's the first year of college.
I was looking for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
The colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
Can you please laugh at Tom?
Due to bad weather, the plane was late.
Can I take your dictionary?
My fluid knowledge of language is sufficient for many situations, but not for the manifestation of my, often contradictory, emotions.
I was in a great mood.
I'm a professor.
There's nothing to do in this town.
Tom's a snitch.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book is on the shelf.
I often feel a heart attack.
Tom's on a secret mission.
I'm not blaming you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know this girl from somewhere.
I climbed up once.
Show me the photos!
She wanted to become a nurse.
I'm sorry I'm always bothering you.
Tom's risking everything.
He's a man of power.
That's wonderful!
I'm goofy.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it on time?
It's strange the mailman hasn't come yet.
Try to do one thing at a time.
How can we prevent this from happening?
His novels are a favorite among young people.
There's a cat.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'll buy a boat soon, what kind of insurance should I choose?
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
She was surprised to hear the news.
He's not an American, he's an Englishman.
How do you say “thank you” in Japanese?
There were no injuries.
Have you ever been punished for driving fast?
I'll be right up.
We have to go.
Tom is a mechanic.
His accident has taught me a lot.
Are we ready to go?
Why?
The storm shouldn't have any effect on our plans.
Tom is a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There are no girls on the internet.
She tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go outside and walk.
Like most 18-year-olds, Tom isn't sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi has written many musical works for bassoon.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry broke his right ankle in a bicycle accident on Sunday in France.
Where there are many grandmothers, there are many children.
Tom's tense like a string.
Never lose hope.
It sounds simple, I know.
It was just a slap on the cake.
How long has it been since you stopped teaching at that school?
Tom looked very confused.
The results were incredible.
Choose one.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes are squeezing.
Have you fully recovered?
He got what he wanted.
I'll listen.
The job was already done.
Tom was speaking very loudly.
She's drinking like a tramp.
Don't move!
The accident was recorded by an observer.
Did I let it go?
Are you happy?
This is the dumbest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew that Tom doesn't know that he speaks French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship has gradually turned into love.
There's a saying in China that you can't judge a man by appearance.
It's boring.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the right side is in New York.
They need each other.
What the fuck is going on here?
There are indications that the reception, which is known for its luxurious dishes, will be slightly more modest this year.
Did you report to the police?
He gave up.
Italy is a beautiful country.
What's wrong with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Violent criminals were often orphaned as a child.
Meet me with Tom.
After a long discussion, I finally did things on my own.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who saves on words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to my house last night for dinner.
Look at how much it is!
A living truth.
You're very unsinkable.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to go.
Now is a great time to buy one.
You're right about that.
He knows the names of all his clients.
Tom came out of it.
Tom got involved with people he never had to mess with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and what to write.
Tom's unkind.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's a problem you have to solve yourself.
I was overreacting.
Termites eat wood.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom dropped the book.
This has to go on.
You tricked me.
You don't have to judge a man by his appearance.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the e-mail!
I pretend I don't know what's going on.
They'll be giving speeches tomorrow.
What is this?
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've been there before.
Me, too.
It's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
What are your plans then?
The kids are sleeping.
That was very good.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
This town, like many townspeople in England, has a fairly long history.
Tom closed the door.
It wasn't fun for me, so I went home early.
It's time for the kids to go to bed.
Where's your stuff?
He worked very hard and saved a lot of money.
I don't like to socialize.
Tom's alone in the living room.
He lived a simple life.
We offered help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
It smells delicious.
The first phase is over.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even an extra.
We're glad to have you here.
Can I have another glass of beer?
Tom was sure of himself.
Sit down for a moment, please.
It's Copacabana!
I wonder how Tom feels.
She takes care of her old mother.
You're the happiest person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I have plants.
I bought a bunch of lead today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Do you learn French in your school?
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before crossing the street.
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom will recover.
You're important to me.
I don't expect anything from you.
Go right.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see a difference.
Don't get carried away.
I'm used to not liking anyone.
The brakes squeaked.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You can see it all in black.
Just like a bean.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with the boy?
Tom still knows how to recite the song he wrote when he was 13 years old.
It's empty.
Did you see that Tom was gone?
Be careful.
How would she translate that for you?
I'm willing to pay you well to do that.
Where did you get that idea?
What are you talking about?
It was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you were gonna be busy.
A lot of people wonder.
I hope it's a good time tomorrow.
Mary nodded.
Let's sit down.
Come and look.
Tom really seems familiar.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
I'm giving up.
Do your kids have their own rooms?
Tom kept all the letters Mary sent him.
Go have a drink with Tom.
She's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
A woman's chiffon isn't complete without a little black dress.
I can't sit still.
Finish this.
We have no choice but to kill.
Where's the toilet?
A Happy Resurrection!
Tom helped me save that dinar by telling me for a cheaper place to buy it.
I owe you an apology.
You can't do anything but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's been working all his life.
Go! Go!
Which way are you going?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
I need to fix my watch.
Tom will live.
Please read between the lines.
You won!
That's a bad sign.
I got it wrong.
Tom had dinner with Mary.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'll be late.
I was eating at a speed.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You need to leave a message to Tom.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
I want what you want.
Health is wealth.
Tom now has a family.
That doesn't surprise me.
As far as I know, he never came on time.
Sweet dreams!
Someone's got to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
The boy threw a stone.
Can I call you in 20 minutes?
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
As little as we know of her origin, at least we can be sure that she is the pilot of the Evangelion.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
Can you leave us alone?
I almost forgot my passport.
Why do you do that, if I may ask?
The deer is faster than the stronger.
People used to write books with hitchhiking machines.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I live in Sarajevo.
I've reacted instinctively.
It's a toilet.
Tom doesn't see anything wrong with letting Mary learn to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I want to fuck you.
I hope that's not the case.
Give me one example.
How could I hate Tom?
Carry this.
What a tortoise!
What is tomorrow?
I've always known that.
Tom thought I was you.
I'm looking forward to your letter.
When there are no cats, the mice cycle water.
We need this from Tom.
Japan is ruled by the Emperor and the King of Spain.
It's Alina's book.
Will we see Tom again?
The world was on the brink of a nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962.
Have fun while you can.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Are you dyslexic?
Melanie's drinking milk.
Where'd you see Tom?
It's all quiet again.
I'm serious.
Can we order, please?
What's he doing?
Otherwise, what's your address?
What I saw was depressing.
They made fun of me.
I'm angry.
Slow down, Tom.
Can you give an example?
I'm not going to go to Bust with you this weekend.
He stole a very precious diamond ring.
That's my cat.
Tom drinks like a tramp.
As in the good old days.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Is that what you want?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
We have your size, but not in that color.
It doesn't look like you.
He's always here between 5 and 6 o'clock.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hope I can do that.
I don't like stubborn people.
Sitting all day is bad for you.
The rainy season begins in June.
You always work.
That's perfectly normal.
You missed your luck, Tom.
The wall looked smooth and unbreakable.
Do you hear anything?
He has two cars.
He'll probably still be angry.
He greeted us and left.
Welcome to Tatoeba.
I see, I don't see.
Bleeding.
I'm glad you answered.
We're close friends.
We can't be friends anymore.
In the future, many workers will be replaced by robots.
Tom was totally drunk.
I admit I'm wrong.
This house belongs to him.

I'll try everything once.
Tom taught me how to read.
Tomorrow is a math test.
Don't let him get away with such a good chance.
Laughter is contagious.
They sell fish and meat.
It was just like that.
I recognized him at first sight.
I've never worn a sleeping bag in my life.

I'm sorry, the relationship is still busy.
Tom just told me the opposite.
He has one son and two daughters.
Here are your bags.
You're the boss.
He took Jane out for dinner.
Who broke the cup?
You're just wasting your time.
What Tom said can't be applied to this situation.
There are several reasons.
What are you going to do from now on?
I'm really proud of that.
Stop worrying so much.
What's the matter with you?
I like grapes.
What are you supposed to do?
I didn't care.
He's back from Canada.
“You talk too much,” he said.
I'm really happy about that.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
We missed Tom a lot.
I'm not ashamed of that.
They'll know what to do.
We didn't make it.
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
I got off the train.
You promised you'd help me.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I feel good now.
To be honest, I don't know.
I saw the bus.
She can't stop us.
You're saying you deliberately hid your good side?
He's not the one who drank all the milk.
I don't think so.
Tell him.

Be careful.
Me and all my brothers share a room.
Layla started crying right away.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Looks like this diamond is real.
To learn all these words is not to be taken into account.
What have you done now?
I'm sure you can.
You can't go into that room.
How old are you really?
You'd be crazy to stay.
You tried.
Tom decided to sell the car.
Who are you?
A new snow avalanche took place on the way to E<0xC4><0x8D>eskaret in the Oda municipality of Hordaland on Tuesday night and it is not known if anyone was trapped in the avalanche.
Are you a Uyghur?
I'm claustrophobic.
I can't fix the car myself.
Zini!
Please, hurry up.
Tom nodded his head.
Do we have to tell anyone?
He's been swimming since the cold.
I'm getting better.
That's what Tom meant.
Don't be mad.
His memory loss is more of a psychological problem than a physical one.
He's exhaled.
He began to sneeze.
As it came, so it went.
It's not as scary as it looks.
I'm mad at Tom.
Tom could be better.

That meant a lot to me.
The effect was quite different from what we intended.
Fish, please.
Aren't you done yet?
I'll have to think about it,
Tom was talking about music.
Everything has its price.
It was warm yesterday.
There were so many people on the train that I had to stand.
Are you Uighur?
The curiosity killed the cat.
Why do people go to the movies?
I don't have a home today.
Tom and Mary agree.
When can Tom come home?
Did you intentionally do that?
I can see the reflection of my face in the window.
Go talk to Tom.
Make a decision.
There's no use trying to persuade him.
I was thinking about my family.
You could've saved me coming in just by telling me I wasn't supposed to be here today.
This will make it a lot easier for us, Psoao.

That should save us some money.
He worked ten hours incessantly.
This one's pretty cool.
That publishing company is solvent.
Choose one.
How did you find out where Tom was?
Stop looking for a prince on a white horse, they don't exist.
It's his, isn't it?
Tom's still going to be mad.
They can't recognize each other anymore.
I'm too old for something like that.
I don't fall for it.
He's a liar, isn't he?
I'd bet.
The price doesn't matter.
You deserve a reward.
She's very patient.

Why should he listen to you?
It never has the courage to happen.
I'm leaving school.
How old are you?
What's this movie like?
Did it work for me?
Turn right.
I'd need eternity to explain everything.
I haven't worked for many years.

I like grapes.
I bought a lot of stuff.
When's your birthday?
I'm devastated.
I assumed you were busy.
It's clear.
Continue with the digging.
Why are we this mess?
Tom's confidence was shattered when his boss took him out in front of his colleagues.
I'm not worried at all.
We have a problem.
Tom knew all that.
Will you do that to me?
I probably won't watch this.
Stop worrying about it.
Come in.
Did I call you?

What can I tell them?
I went into her room.
I can't sleep at all.
They couldn't keep up with it in the second half.
Just give him some time.

Before this decision goes into effect, no one will even have a finger to move to solve this.

Tom is no longer a baby.
Welcome to your new home.
Tom must have known Mary wouldn't want to do that.
Quietly move.
I'm happy.
I miss talking to Sally.
Tom's gonna talk.
They were all young once.
It wasn't easy for me.
Good-bye!

Things changed after that.
Tom tried to help us.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.

Get lost!
Who's home?
I'm really happy to be here.
Please, don't yell.
Why do you behave like a kid?
Eat slowly.
We could have saved Tom only if we arrived a few minutes earlier.

Are you involved in this?
Everybody's standing.
Do you believe in eternal life?
In the beginning God created heaven and earth.
By the end of June, they were ready to vote.
I used to pretend I didn't know Tom.
You can never get the shit out of it so it doesn't smell.
Don't rush.
No one can know everything.
I'm objective.
I'm leaving early today.
I'm a student.
Hello, how are you?
Do I have red ears?
He's not a doctor.
That's enough.
How many instruments can you play?
Is the cat on the chair or under the chair?
Employees can be motivated by good, fair salaries, the chance to work in a good team or on exciting tasks, and with clear economic incentives such as bonuses and opportunities for advancement.
Education in this world disappoints me.
I doubt I'm the only one who noticed it.
That's encouraging news.
Add me the sugar, please.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're funny.
Every day read something that no one else reads. Every day thinks something that no one else thinks. Every day do something that no one else would be crazy to do. It is bad for the spirit always to be balanced.
Why are you so smart?
He avoided the danger.
Merry Christmas to you!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
Mayuko had a strange dream.
It's too loud for me here.
I doubt you'll find it difficult to get a driver's license.
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Did you intentionally do that?
Is it all settled now?
How can it be that mathematics, which is only the product of human thought independent of experience, is so astonishingly adapted to objects in reality?
Look at that.
We weren't careful enough.
They were armed with guns.
Write something.
Did you get coffee?
Tom seems to be an honest person.
They looked at him as the head of the murder case.
I didn't know you were so rich.
Attention!
Look at this.
The code is Muriel.
I had lunch at the speed.
That's risky.
Giraffes have very long necks.
The girl sees the boy.
My parents died.
His wife put on a shirt for him.
Someone told me about it.
Soak up the pride!
Technology can help.
In order to change red meat, I've simmered chicken breasts in a baking soda for tonight.
I'm always jealous.
Tom is teaching French.
Tom fights like crazy.
I've always liked horror movies.
There's a good chance it'll rain tomorrow.
Something just came up.
I can't get over it.
You sound like you're not having fun.
I couldn't stop crying.
You grew up.
It suits me.
They're not mine.
I fell to the ground.
I'll be late.
I'm doubling the price.
Would you be able to do that?
There are also cats on Mars.
I didn't vote for Tom.
I called him.
A video of the interview was made and published across the internet.
You need money.
Tom had drunk and drowned his sorrow, after that one night of drinking.
Why don't we rest for a while?
Go check it out.
Tom just wanted to say something.
Some people like to travel alone.
It's over.
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
I'm here to play baseball.
You're the boss.
Someone's here.
I guess we won't see each other again.
Is that what you mean?
I didn't even do that.
Do you have anything to report?
I say that all the time.
Don't lie.
Will you take that?
I've just arrived.
I watched Tom die.
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Is Tom coming back?
You're smart.
Such is life!
How did I get here?
Why?
He rarely gives up.
I was looking for you.
Tom's given up his slurred breath.
You should've known that.
There's a lot of work I need to do before I can go home.
It's snowing today.
Money is not a measure of success.
He's taken it upon himself to ignore my advice.
The girls work.
By the way, where do you live?
It seems to be a pretty big museum.
Do you have any questions?
We have complied with their demands.
It's hard to understand French when you speak fast.
Everything else is unimportant.
Do I feel sarcasm?
It'll be half three soon.
They'll know.
Tom bought a pair of black shoes yesterday.
I have a lot of friends.
Let's just check it out.
Cirih is considered one of the major financial centers.
That one's very rare.
Tom wanted to be good.
I'm just not in a hurry.
Do you do any sports?
We weren't careful enough.
Are you okay?
Don't look.
How desperate are you?
Let's not undress.
I've been to more than 10 foreign countries so far.
It's not getting any worse.
Answer me.
People have a short memory.
I'm still making mistakes.
Tom's got a hard job.
I'm glad we won.
You can't go into that room.
My mother was angry.
"Is it better for you?" "No, it's worse for me."
Are they friends?
Everything is temporary, but beautiful memories are alive.
I was in the mountains.
It's heavy.
Waiting for the bus.
Which one's easier?
Did you wash the dishes?
We've been fighting hard.
It was a cup that broke the glass.
He doesn't like us.
Please, go on.
This could hurt.
We'd save time if we went down through Park Street.
A police officer arrested him for driving in a drunken state.
We're gonna go crazy.
That's what he sees.
Tom's always dreaming.
That would be great.
The knife is not sharp.
We hope he likes people.
We all have a price.
Why'd you shave your beard?
That gave him an idea.
I'm so lucky.
Trains in Serbia are terribly slow.
No one knows me in Boston.
They lived happily ever after.
This time it's going to the city.
Your time will come soon.
I think there's something wrong with some politicians.
Where's Tehran?
Because they're made in Italy, these jeans are very expensive.
Get over any obstacles with this monster from the truck!
We went to see turtles on the beach.
Mary spends a lot of time on the phone, sending messages and emails to friends.
He's always wearing dark clothes.
Happiness was on our side.
Tom works for his father's company.
Tom says he wants to change.
What's this about?
I want to help you.
We're not going back to Boston.
We never lose hope.
Men are children all their lives.
We are close friends.
Mary hasn't cooked meat yet.
Now we need the truth.
I'm supposed to be here all afternoon.
Didn't I teach you anything?
You can go to sleep now.
Why are you asking?
It's big.
It's mine, not his.
Turns out it's true.
What's quick is the bite.
Can you take me to her?
Where were you born?
Come sit next to me.
Triput measures, once a week.
I found his book.
I couldn't hide my anger because of her bravery.
Butter is made from milk.
There's nothing we can do about it.
He can't come because he's sick.
It's all better.
Do you want to see something specific?
That's not a real problem.
I miss her.
I don't know the answer.
I took the exam!
It's really hot.
Let's start right away.
Let us help you.
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
Please don't mess up.
Does it still have a temperature?
Tom was crazy, you know.
Tom put the map on the table.
Who are you running from?
Who's your teacher?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
What did you do to me?
I'll talk to Tom about this.
Nobody's working. Everybody's watching the World Cup.
I'm still a little tired.
What is your blood group?
We can't go back.
We will visit you from time to time.
These headphones don't work.
Keep on working.
I couldn't take my eyes off you from the moment I walked into that room.
He didn't have the courage to do what he wanted.
His comment is easy to understand in the wrong way.
