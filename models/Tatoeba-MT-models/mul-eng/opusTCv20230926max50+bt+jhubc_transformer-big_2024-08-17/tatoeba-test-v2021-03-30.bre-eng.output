Here I am staying.
I saw a monster in the zoo.
Thousands of people.
Do you want to come?
Look, there's no apple tree.

Is the head always scratching?
Diwall!
He's got a head in his head.
I wasn't my one.
Don't leave me alone.
They weren't.
My money has been stolen from either side.
It is difficult to study a foreign language.

Fill with sili is my turmeric
- Gwarizius out?
Watch out!
I'm pretty sure I'd have done something like that sometime.

I'm sorry.
Sunspots often cause them to fly away.
Tom is the only one who knows what really happened.
Thank you very much.
Look, I don't have a tree.
In the garden?
I have to go to bed before midnight almost always.
Dihun out?

NAF!
How did you get out?
Tom plays rugby.

I think I did.
Work on it.
I don't like it either.
It doesn't work.
I'm done.
This film was enjoyed by Dom and Vari both.
They don't speak Spanish.
If I'm done with the whole thing, give it to me please.
Pain in my face.
Do you drink milk?
Yeah.
It's a starting point.
Pokat to one is like glue a pod.

Ask for Paris.
He's on the third.
You'd better not go.
Don't make any mistakes.
I've had a lot of accidents.
Thank you, my brother.
'Where's the Welsh Preacher?
It's coming!

Is that coffee?
I've got a snorkel.
He was very poor.
Pokat to one vote is like a player's lip.

Stay at home.
They want me to know that you're innocent.
I'd rather die to be without Fadil.
Go where I'm at.
NAF, how fantastic it is.
