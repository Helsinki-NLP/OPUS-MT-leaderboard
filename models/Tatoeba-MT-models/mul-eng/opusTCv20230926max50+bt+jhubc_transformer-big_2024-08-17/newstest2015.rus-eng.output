FANO of Russia will hold the final expert session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) together with RAN will hold the third Expert Session “Evaluation of the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations”.
The meeting will be final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, according to a press release received in the edition of "Lenty.Ru".
At the third meeting, it is planned to summarize the results of the Expert Session for the year and to form the final list of indicators to assess the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Separately, the participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of the scientific groups and the criteria for the evaluation.
The third expert session will be the final event in the series of events on the formation of a single approach for all three academies to the methodology of evaluation of the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded, and the final version of the normative documents is in agreement.
According to the results of the upcoming session, we need to complete the formation of the processes of scientific and expert analysis, to agree on the stages and timing of the evaluation”, – said Elena Aksenov, head of the expert and analytical management of the FANO of Russia.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than 100 scientific institutions of Russia.
As a result, the resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: Moscow city, Solyanka street, house 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars.
Astrophysicists from the University of California at Santa Cruz have studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneity in stellar clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow to search among the stars relatives, that is, the ones that emerged from one cluster.
The results of their research were published by the authors in the journal Nature, and you can find them briefly on the university’s website.
The cause of the same chemical composition of the nearest stars is turbulent mixing in the clouds of gas preceding the formation of the stars.
Even if the star is born then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of its birth and the region of formation of the stars-relatives.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to the appearance of differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
The results of the simulation carried out by astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, experts using a supercomputer modeled two interstellar gas streams, which together formed the cloud.
Within a few million years, this object, under the influence of its own gravity, is transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
The scientists added paint marks to the initial gas flows and found that thanks to the rapid turbulence in the cloud, a high degree of chemical uniformity is achieved.
According to astrophysicists, their study proves that it is possible to search for stars-relatives by chemical composition, as well as to determine possible regions of formation of such objects.
Karrata police arrested 20-year-old after chasing a motorcycle at high speed
The motorcycle was confiscated after it was driven at a speed of 125 km/h in an area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and across the bushland to hide from police in Pilbara.
A police transport patrol in Carrat this morning tried to stop the blue motorcycle, finding that its speed reaches 125 km/h when it left the service station on Batgate Road.
Police report that the motorcyclist did not stop and continued on Bergess Road, then turned to Bushland, as a result of which the police lost his sight.
The motorcycle and the person corresponding to the driver’s description were spotted next to the house on Wolcott Way in Bulgaria.
Carrata police have charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and dangerous driving.

Investigation of the accident TU-204 in Vnukovo completed in 2012
The Investigative Committee of Russia has completed an investigation into the accident of the TU-204 aircraft at Vnukovo Airport in December 2012.
This was reported today in the Russian Federation.
"Moscow interregional traffic traffic control on transport of the Investigative Committee of Russia completed investigation of a criminal case triggered by the accident of the aircraft TU-204 of the Red Wings airline in the airport of Vnukovo.
The cause of the disaster was the failure of the crew of standard procedures and the increased speed of take-off.
George Webbster Accused of Rape in Hotels in Neerne and Pitlochry
The man will appear before the court on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webbster, 28, was charged during a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman at the Scottish Hotel in Pitlochry, County Pertshire, on June 7, 2013.
It is claimed that Webster attacked her when she was “unconscious, asleep and unable to give consent.”
In addition, Webster is accused of raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Neerne, which is located on the North Scottish Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Ray appointed a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh on 17 November.
Lavrov: Russia will not be knocking on the door due to new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not knock on the door due to new sanctions.
This was announced today by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia Sergey Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of the IGIMO.
On the basis of our responses to the new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even think, fantasize, because everything has to be specifically calculated," he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will look like this time, then we will make decisions about how to respond.
This will not be related to the knocking on the door, some insults, falsely understood, the minister stressed.
We will, first of all, push away from our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the actions of partners on the subject of their adequacy, feasibility and reliability.
According to the steps that are being taken in the area of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what the partners are seeking, - continued the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry.
If they say out loud that “these sanctions will also be painful for us, but we are forced to go for it to punish Russia,” that is probably not very adequate.
As for the WTO’s withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions, there is no.
On the contrary, we want to learn more about WTO tools, including when it comes to trade disputes, Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome, as we believe, the EU's discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and at the same time is applying anti-dumping measures against sectors of the Russian economy.
“We are ready to implement WTO mechanisms and to defend our position on the impermissibility of applying the rules of the third EU energy package retrospectively,” Lavrov said.
How to properly use cheese in the design of the garden?
Irina Okuneva answers the questions:
Since the siren after flowering loses its main appeal, it is desirable to plant it along with other shrubs.
It is very well combined with many cultures.
And next to the cheese, you can and should plant both plants, decorative in other terms, and flowering at the same time with it.
Another plus of the cheese is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stem tree of different height, improved bush, a bush with a wide base, and even a garden bonsai likeness - a tree with a strangely curved stem.
Just choose the shape that more matches the design of your garden.
In Karelia for the sale of fake money convicted resident of Leningrad region
According to the Republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in his criminal business in Olonetsk and Segezhsky districts.
In addition to Karelia, he has committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already succeeded in inheriting in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonetssky District Court.
And to end the investigation into the crimes committed in our republic, it was staged in Segejo.
In the course of the investigation, the blame for several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money related to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June of this year, the criminal case materials with the indictment were sent to court.
On Friday, August 29, the court decided to replace the four-year jail term with a stay in the colony of the general regime.
The sentence did not come into force legally.
Last week, two other sellers of fake money were convicted, which were paid by them in Petrozavodsk stores.
The citizens of Azerbaijan came to Karelia also from St. Petersburg.
One of them is free for five years, the other for four.
A fine of 500 thousand rubles is imposed on each person.
The sentence has also not yet entered into force legally.
In Arkhangelsk marked the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Dervi<0xC5><0xA1>"
The meeting, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervish delivered military aid to the USSR from the United States and the United Kingdom.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial meeting took place at the berth stone of the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the coastal name of Sedov in Solombal.
The event was attended by representatives of the veteran organizations of Arkhangelsk, children from the Cadet class.
We first met twenty-three years ago when a deposit stone was laid.
But at the same time, today’s event is not a holiday, but a day to remember those who did not return to the sea,” said Boris Karpov, chairman of the Board of Veterans of the Northern Seafaring.
Then the event was performed by the city spiritual orchestra, and the students of the Cadet classes gave the veterans flowers and marched with the flags of Russia and the flag of Victory.
The meeting ended with the laying of flowers to the laying stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of shaped boots, lead, wool and many other inventory and equipment).
In addition, on board the ships were also military equipment and weapons - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen "Harrikein" fighters, in disarray.
At the same time, the convoy escort consisted of 16 ships of the British Navy, among which were two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of ships was not found by the enemy and successfully reached the destination - Arkhangelsk.
Of a total of 848 ships that participated in vital operations to carry out caravans, 126 were killed by transport and about 50 warships.

Remembering the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill in which the organization of trade unions is protected as civil law.
“Where the unions are, there are middle-class jobs,” says Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota who is co-chair of the Progressive faction Congress.
That is why I am proud to present the Enlargement of Workers' Rights Act along with the symbol of the John Lewis Civil Rights Movement.
This innovative bill will give workers the same legal opportunities when it comes to discrimination against the organization of trade unions as with other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of the opponents of trade unions.
Amendment of the Labour Relations Regulation Act in such a way as to allow workers who face discrimination for participation in the organization of trade unions to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and fines - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is no doubt not a radical initiative – at least according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the co-authors of the bill offer is to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks of trade unions in recent years—in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country—the Americans once supported countries around the world in accepting, expanding, and respecting labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country at the same time protected democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas McArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the militarized autocratic regime of Hideki Tojo was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in forming a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly acknowledged that “the right of workers to organize, to negotiate, and to collective action is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Acknowledging that workers will need to be organized and heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that openly stated: “The right to form associations in order to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or sphere of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will not have legal force; measures aimed at these purposes will be considered unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was president of his own International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which in 1948 would be adopted by the United Nations as a world agreement, Roosevelt and his constituents "involved the guarantee
For generations, Americans have taken the basic position that labor rights are human rights.
When this country consulted other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions — and to have this trade union participate as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government institutions — must be guaranteed.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is wise indeed to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As St. Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the strength of the nation, but increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised the whole nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how it should be for us.
The official recognition of labour rights as human rights — and the extension of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions — has long matured.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are reviving the ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
A judge temporarily blocks a law that could shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the U.S., a federal judge temporarily blocked the passage of Louisiana law on Sunday, which his supporters say is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by Louisiana Governor Bobby Ginadal in June and was due to enter into force on September 1, doctors who have abortions would be required to have the authority to receive patients in the hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that at the moment doctors can continue to make legal abortions, continuing to seek such powers.
“The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing to exercise their powers,” Judge John deGravells wrote in his ruling.
The hearing will be appointed during the month in which the judge will make a more permanent decision under this law.
Defenders of the right to abortion have happily met this decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it will give doctors more time to get hospital powers.
“Today’s decision ensures that Louisiana women will be protected from a fraudulent law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Nortap, president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who filed a lawsuit to stop the law from three out of five people.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision would apply to doctors from two clinics who were not plaintiffs in the case and also applied for admission.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed such laws, and courts have recently recognized such measures as unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that the laws on the powers of admission impose restrictions on doctors that are not necessary from the point of view of medicine.
Opponents of abortions object that such measures are aimed at protecting women’s health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing the clinic.
Only one doctor who has an abortion in Louisiana has the authority to be admitted to the hospital, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state were to be forced to stop performing this procedure, this doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop performing this procedure, the group said.
Criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors who have abortions while their claims to the authority of adoption await the decision.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of product in the range of trade networks should be Russian-made, says the deputy of the State Duma from the faction "Just Russia" Oleg Nilov.
The Parliament has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, writes the newspaper "Izvestia".
The document will be further detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This concerns goods that are not produced in Russia. <0x3C>...> According to the other groups of products that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its regiments to domestic producers, "- Nilov told the publication.
Along with the amendments to the article "On the basics of state regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation", the bill provides for an amendment to the Tax Code, establishing a reduced VAT rate of 10% when implementing products manufactured in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in trading networks is part of the package of incentive measures for Russian producers.
On the shelves will appear several times more domestic goods.
However, the initiative can have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.
According to the lawyer of the company "Nalogovik", a member of the independent expert center "Public Duma" Sergey Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food sectors, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.
In addition, there will be agricultural producers, farmers, small shops.
They will be able to sell more, which means that profits will increase.
In addition, they will be given the right to dictate to retailers their terms and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase the volume of their activities and sales, which will lead to higher taxes being paid than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will start to expand, some will grow faster, and contribute to GDP growth.
Russia’s dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, but not immediately,” the expert said.
In the past, Russian companies often could not break into the shelves of local stores due to the high competition from foreign analogues.
Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche has been released and can be breathed with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that after all the necessary agreements and sanitary checks on the Russian market, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will be delivered to the Russian market.
In other words, now is the “moment of calm” when the former players have already left and the new ones have not yet come.
After almost a month, it is possible to talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the increase in prices for finished products", - said AiF.ru, the first Vice-President of the Russian public organization "Russian Club of Financial Directors", Tamara Kasnov.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will allow to consolidate the sector behind local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, not with goods that are cheaper at the expense of the subsidies of another state.
In other words, the struggle for the buyer will unfold between companies working under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, according to Kasyanova, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of compatriots by far not all articles.
And in this situation, the trading networks will have to "tighten" the share of Russian goods to half the range.
In this regard, there is growing concern that poor quality products will come to the shelves.
It is possible that foreign products with broken labels will be delivered under the appearance of manufactured in Russia,” the expert adds.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves are affected by this arrangement, as the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not exclude that the law on quotas for domestic goods can also affect consumers.
The fact is that some products of Russian production may yield in quality to import analogues, while stores will be able to trigger prices on the second, as on the deficit goods.
Forgotten in the early 2000s, the idea of import substitution was once again discussed in February of this year due to the continuous devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the issue of refusal to import products is becoming even more relevant.
The law is designed to oblige retailers when forming orders to suppliers to be considered with domestic manufacturers.
Then we will go much faster and more confident on the way to import replacement, and the production planning system according to the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter period of time,” says MP Oleg Nilov.
A particularly effective quota mechanism would be for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25%.
Our farmers are really able to completely cover the shelves of Russian stores.
In addition, a powerful impulse can also get meat production.
As you know, the largest share of imports is kept by beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out, 65-70% is still due to Russian products,” Kasyanova argues.
Experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quotas for domestic products contributes to the import substitution and can accelerate this process.
However, this initiative itself will not lead to import substitution, as a set of measures is needed for this, Litvinenko is confident.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be brought from abroad, which means that there will be no full import replacement, but significant steps in this direction will be taken.
In addition, there is little to set quotas, it is still necessary to set in the country the production of domestic products in order to fulfill these quotas.
These quotas are just such guarantees and will provide,” the expert notes.
Untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video of their late mother's memory, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women who breastfeed in rural Australia face a higher risk of ovarian cancer death than those who live in cities.
The researchers analyzed the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 percent lived five years after the diagnosis was made.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the Institute of Medical Research QIMR Berghofer reported that the likelihood of dying during the study is 20 percent higher in those living in regions and remote areas of the state than in those living in urban areas.
LESSONS: New drugs may slow down lung cancer and ovarian cancer <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The researchers followed the women’s medical path for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases and socio-economic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Women of older age, and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis, had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 percent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the cities are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that an untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible factors.
“This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly located in large cities,” she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of outbound services that would allow professionals to treat women closer to home, and support programs for people undergoing treatment far from home, could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of the geographic location, the study found that long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Coast, Eli<0xC5><0xA1>e Niv, said she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, the doors of the new FAP will be opened in Kugenerskiy district
Construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaibelyak was started in April of this year and was carried out on a typical project.
The cost of the work amounted to just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Public Relations and Information Department of the Head of Mary El, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the funds of the republican budget in accordance with the address investment program.
The total area of the built-up treatment and prevention facility is almost 230 square meters.
It will provide medical assistance to the inhabitants of eight settlements: the villages of Toktaybelyak and the villages of Dementievo, Puncheryumal, Tunisia, Fomichi, Toraibelyak, Shinur and Chaskayal.
The new Feldscher-Akuscher point will replace the existing FAP, the building of which was built in 1918 and has long since exhausted its resources, and its premises do not meet sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new facility will open in the near future.
The man who killed his four-month-old son in a state of inattentiveness will appear before the court
Chuvashia's resident will be on the cusp of being convicted of murdering her own child.
In Cheboksary, an investigation into the criminal case against the 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk, accused of causing death for negligence, was completed.
The investigation found that on July 26 of this year, the accused along with his four-month-old son came to celebrate the birthday of the child of his kuma in Cheboksary.
After a long table, the novice boxer decided to stay in the guests and put the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up in the night and cried, a sober woman placed him next to her on the bed to feed her breast, but she soon fell asleep.
During her sleep, the woman stumbled upon her son, as a result of which he died of suffocation.
The criminal case, according to the press service of the SCR on Chuvashia, is sent to the court.
Inflation has come out of vacation.
Will the Russians feel a sharp rise in prices?
As a result of cross-sanctions of the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and not fall into the forecasts of the authorities, analysts of VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed consequences of anti-sanctions will lead to inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast by the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, next year and less - 6.5%.
However, according to the newspaper Kommersant, this week the MER is expected to make "small but principled" adjustments in the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the department can lower the estimate of inflation for 2015, which will eliminate the expected slump in the population's income growth.
In the forecast, it was assumed that food sanctions of the Russian Federation were in effect for a year - until August 2015.
How could such a high rate of inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation is a one-off shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change,” a source told the newspaper in the Ministry of Finance.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the government’s financial and economic bloc’s expectations of inflation and predict price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.
The main effect of the product bans will come along with the possible introduction of sales tax (VAT) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, experts are convinced.
The inflation peak of 9% will be reached in February, after which annual price growth rates will go down, experts believe.
By the way, last week Rosstat undermined the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation imposed "accurate sanctions".
AIF.ru interviewed the experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of Analytical Department of FC AForex:
The price increase is already observed by the main segments of the goods.
Moreover, when socially significant products began to be valued, the government was forced to launch systemic price stability monitoring measures to prevent the risks of unjustified price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators so that authorities know exactly who, when, and for what reason initiates price hikes.
The key factors of the growth of the consumer price index continue to remain the colossal rate of capital outflow, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian megaregulator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, as well as the embargo on foreign currencies.
If inflationary pressure remained under control, the cost of the basket of a minimum set of products would not have jumped by 12% for a single quarter.
The ban on the import of food products provoked a shock of the offer in the domestic market and led to a completely logical increase in the final value.
Since at the current stage we are not able to fully launch the import substitution mechanism, as well as increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market due to domestic production, the response sanctions will continue to bear the risks of growth of the inflationary component.
Add to this the fiscal reasons associated with a lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the worsening outlook for economic growth, inflation could well exceed 8% by the end of this year.
Alexander Razuvaev, Director of the analytical department "Alpari"
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, at zero it was also above the current level, another fact that it was then offset by rapid economic growth.
I think by the end of the year inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Platon Maguta, Managing Assets of the Maguta Foundation
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia has so far been successfully restrained, but if there is a further increase in pressure, first of all, on the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase the inflation expectations of the population, which are usually to be used in the traditional way.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by state regulation.
But price growth begins traditionally after summer sweltering and perhaps this autumn will become more noticeable.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia at 7.5% is likely to stand, as the Russian Federation still has financial accumulations.
Gardening centers are saddened by the decrease in the number of homeowners
Such a fall, due to an exceptional reduction in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could lead to gardening centers starting to lose tens of millions of pounds a year, when today’s young consumers reach “the basic age of gardening,” according to a study by TimesTA.
According to this report, people who rent housing spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that owners of their own homes spend on gardening.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting courtyards in front of the house for parking and the reduction of garden size as other factors that pose a threat to the industry, the annual sales volume of which, according to estimates, is <0xC2><0xA3>5 million.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, the UK’s lowest level of spending on household gardeners’ goods.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society have reported that renting housing and lack of space for the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Gai Barter, senior adviser on gardening at RHS, said: “Cultivating plants in containers, for example, is especially popular with tenants who can transport plants with them when they move around.”
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the retail trade in gardening goods as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria carried out a mass cleaning in the Fund "Agriculture"
Three of the four heads of the “Agriculture” fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Agricultural Fund were replaced as early as Friday.
Officially, the Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria only reported on the removal from the post of Executive Director Atanas Dobrev.
His place was occupied by Lozana Vasileva.
It turned out that on Friday, two of the three Deputy Executive Directors of the Fund were quietly replaced.
Deputy Executive Director Tatiana Angelova, who was previously responsible for state aid and the SAPARD program, has been released, reports BGNES with reference to the newspaper "Trud".
I was not on the board of directors of the fund because we are not legally members of the board, but I was later informed that I was released.
I can’t say why my dismissal isn’t reported on the fund’s website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope to find out more on Monday," Angelov told the publication.
It will be replaced by Ivanka Bagdatov, who has until now been head of “Investment lending” at the central fund in “Agriculture” in Sofia.
The Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Until now, he has been responsible for direct subsidies for EU-funded fields.
Zhivko Zhivkov, who was head of the regional management of the Agricultural Fund in the city of Veliko-Tyrnovo until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the Atij Aliyev-Veli Foundation retained her post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all the changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey Calls on U.S. Diplomat in connection with Spying Report
Turkey’s foreign ministry has summoned the country’s highest-ranking U.S. diplomat for clarification in connection with a report on U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Bulent, said the U.S. official and Turkish officials had discussed the message on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence facility for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has reduced the importance of this message, saying all leading countries are spying on each other.
Earlier reported information that Germany’s main intelligence agency had also made Ankara the subject of intelligence, prompted a more angry response from the Turkish government.
China's largest companies have joined forces against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China’s largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and internet giant Tencent Holdings (society, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (China’s largest search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online market with Alibaba.
However, to achieve the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left behind even its American rivals - eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
Union of the largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in the joint venture, 70% of which will be owned by Wanda and 15% by each of the Internet companies, the Wanda Group said in a statement.
The company is planned to register in Hong Kong.
The SP will combine Baidu search services with the popular WeChat social platform (the largest social network in China, with a user base of about 438 million people), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 beautician hotels, the Wanda Group manages at least 49 commercial real estate properties across China and 40 shopping malls.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (over $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and theme park in Qingdao (a city in eastern China on the Yellow Sea coast).
It is expected that the project will attract more than 1 million visitors annually and bring profit at the level of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the American network of AMC Entertainment Holdings cinemas, making the company the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all of its shopping centers, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, which will be developed by Alibaba’s once-created competitor.
According to Don Ce, who will lead the new company, thanks to the combination of Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new platform is set to become the world’s largest online-to-offline platform, says Dun Ce.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract buyers on the Internet in order for them to come to regular offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is selling coupons like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
“O2O is the biggest ‘pirog’ in online commerce,” said Wanda Wang Jianglin (Bloomberg quote).
“Now the current O2O site in China does not exist, and in this situation everyone’s chances are approximately equal,” he said.
China’s online market is the largest in the world, and, according to McKinsey & Co., its volume will increase more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has increased to 632 million, according to Bloomberg official statistics: this is more of the population of any country in the world, except India.
And by 2015, that number could grow to 850 million people.
Union of the Rich
Tencent's head Ma Huateng until recently was China's richest man, however, according to Bloomberg's millionaires index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already rounded it up to $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma’s fortune is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion comes to his share in Alibaba.
Baidu leader Robin Lee is now ranked third among China’s richest people, while Wanda’s Van Jianglin is ranked fourth in the ranking.
“It’s very interesting to watch this battle: the three richest people join forces to challenge the even richer,” said Bloomberg, director of China’s e-commerce research center in Hangzhou, Tao Lai.
But he believes that the new company will hardly be able to seriously compete with Alibaba immediately after its creation: “Rome cannot be built in one day”.
The fact that Alibaba is not so easy to compete with not only new companies, but also the well-deserved leaders of the world’s online commerce, shows a report published yesterday on Alibaba’s financial performance for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as something on average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
Alibaba’s net profit for the period is almost twice as high as its competitors’ aggregated index – it has grown nearly three times in the year and amounted to $1.99 billion.
“Alibaba still has a huge potential to generate money, largely thanks to its mobile apps,” said Bloomberg in a statement from the Hong Kong-based Arete Research Service.
According to Alibaba’s updated prospectus on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s website, the number of active mobile users of the company’s services in July was 188 million, which is significantly above the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba’s transactions for the past quarter went to mobile devices.
Alibaba will announce the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg, Alibaba’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could take place as early as September 16.
The road show of the company, ahead of this event, will start on September 3.
Alibaba’s IPO is expected to become a record in NYSE history and will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
Until now, the record for the amount of funds raised on U.S. exchanges belonged to the Visa payment system, which in 2008 held the initial placement of its shares, earning $17.9 billion on it.
At least half of the food products in the trade networks must be Russian-made, according to the deputies of the State Duma.
They have drafted a bill on the subject.
We are talking about making changes to Article 8 of the FZ "On the Basis of State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation" and to the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of domestic products in stores must be in each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are products that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in winter, so for them a "discount" will be made to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law makes a change to the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, establishing a reduced VAT rate of 10% when implementing all food products, the country of origin of which is Russia, reports the newspaper "Izvestia".
On August 27, a draft law on amendments to the "About retail markets", which proposes to revive in Russia agricultural markets, on which small producers will be able to implement their products, was introduced in the lower house of parliament.
Magaluf’s police chief has been charged with corruption
The Estonians presented evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia in the office of the state prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The chief of police in the resort island of Mallorca has been arrested on charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the scandalously-famous Magaluf drinking center.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro has been placed in custody as a result of corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the daily online edition of Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia in the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca for the fight against corruption on Friday.
Two more local police officers have been arrested by the Guards of the Spanish National Guard on charges of corruption and will be interrogated by the judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners say protectionism by the authorities is seriously reflected in the state of their business.
“It’s not about making money anymore, it’s about surviving,” one businessman told the court.
We cannot put our sources of existence at risk.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf hit the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video featuring an 18-year-old British vacationer who ran 24 men during a bar race.
The island’s authorities have since been trying to end the hooliganism in a state of indifference among the restful Magaluf, minimizing the number of scandalous alcoholic bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the mine incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the organizers of the Carnage bars race together were fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mainly popular among young British holidaymakers, has also been the site of numerous accidents in the state of alcoholic beverages associated with crazy fun, known as "balconying", when people jump from one balcony to another or from a pool to a golf course.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
VESNA has prepared a cold surprise in South Australia, bringing torrential rain and strong winds that have affected flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city by 9 p.m., followed by 6.6 mm, which fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a pair of short showers with gusts of wind, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and poured out almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter released an early portion of the spring last week, temperatures fell again on Monday to a high of just 15.8C in the city.
The fragile conditions are believed to have been one of the reasons for the delay in landing Virgin Airlines flights from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land on schedule immediately after 7:30 p.m., but got into the wind shift zone — a sudden change in speed or direction of the wind at a short distance — and was forced to gain altitude.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
These flights showed that the plane had to rise during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay in this flight caused a subsequent delay in several other flights, including Emirates flight from Dubai and Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is forecast in Adelaide on Tuesday with a probability of one or two rainfalls.
Calculation of estimates of construction facilities in Russia will take place in a new way
The issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as the problems of connection to the networks of the Federal Antimonopoly Service take special control.
At FAS, an expert council was established on the development of competition in the construction sector.
At his meeting, Vadim Solovyev, head of the management of the control of HVAC, construction and natural resources of the FAS, said that “today’s calculation of the estimates of construction facilities is absolutely incomprehensible”.
The normative base makes price formation opaque and can lead to an unjustified cost of construction, the FAS said.
And they offer the cost of building state-owned facilities at the design stage to determine based on market prices of constructive solutions instead of the current estimated norms and single prices for technological operations.
These proposals have been put on the road map and are now under consideration in the Ministry.
“The replacement of traditional accounting documentation in construction for the calculations of constructive elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,” Vadim Soloviev explained.
After all, now every bolt and hook is counted in the inventory, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation, dishonest construction companies can bury "whole tractors".
In the meantime, I agree with the FAS.
"The first developments on the transition to the calculation of value on constructive elements already exist: methods for calculating prices for constructive solutions, the calculation of these indicators," said RGB head of the department of urban activities and architecture of Mr. Elena Zhenu.
As a pilot, the field of road construction is chosen.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As Anatoly Demyanko, head of the construction company Profi-invest, told RGB, the estimated regulations have long been outdated, but another mechanism for business has not yet been proposed.
"As for the proposed calculations on the structural elements, in practice this is difficult to implement, since very different technologies are often used in the construction of buildings," he believes.
It is no secret that the stock market is developing largely thanks to the government order.
According to the chairman of the board of the NGO "Expert Community of State Order Professionals" Ekaterina Lesina, today the state is the most paymentable customer.
The deputy director for engineering of the industrial center of capital construction Rosatom Vladimir Malakhov pointed out that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and companies that own monopolistic competences and do not allow it.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only on condition that access to contracts will be protected as much as possible from someone else’s controlling influence.
At the expert council it was proposed to form the state order system in such a way that the same performer is not entitled to receive more than one contract in the amount of more than 1 billion rubles. or several contracts in the amount of more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry believes that this approach should be evaluated in terms of the impact on business, as well as the efficiency of construction management.
As explained by Elena Zhukov, in this case it will be necessary to assign the client the functions of the general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the regular number of the client and budget costs for its content.
At the same time, the specialists of the customer will have the knowledge to evaluate the quality of the work carried out by the contracting organizations, as well as their safety.
Often, in such a breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly qualified public procurement participants due to the lack of interest in receiving a public order for the incomplete amount of work and the small amount of the contract.
The deputy heads of the expert and consulting center of the Institute of Procurement Alexander Evstashenov believes that now the procedure of the state order has become a business game for the attention of the contractor.
And gave the following example: "the participant when filling in the application should indicate "specific indicators" without specifying the words: "or equivalent", "should be", "from", "more", "less", "analog", "or", "of "type", "cannot be below", "cannot be below", "above", "may", "be
Thus, customers often abuse their right to set requirements for the content of the application submitted by the contracting organizations.
Another problem of 44-FZ, according to Evstashenkov, was the need to assess the quality of work through the "paper" offer of the participant at the stage of the application.
When considering the application of the participant, it is really possible to evaluate only the qualification of the contractor, but not the quality of the work, which has not even begun, - believes the expert.
The quality of the work can be assessed only when it is received.
At the expert council it was also proposed to transfer marginal income from the top to the bottom echelon in order to disappear intermediate contractors.
The chairman of the expert council, the state secretary, the head of the FAS Andrei Tsarikovsky believes that this should not be done, since the general contractor must be responsible for the order.
And otherwise it will happen, as in the famous reprise of Arkady Raikin "Atele": "Is there a claim to the puppets?".
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and mines rained on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while the schools remained in the Gaza Strip.
The start of schooling brought a sense of joy and excitement to the southern Israeli settlements affected by the rockets, but the traces of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the Pasha kindergarten, in which the rocket hit, removed traces of fragments from the walls and children's mountains before the arrival of the students.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re happy to look to the future,” said Ronit Bart, a Kibutz Saad resident and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a full-fledged life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it was “a bit strange” to start school again.
“It was a difficult time and we didn’t leave our homes at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz, which is located near the border with Gaza, to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement halted the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad did not go out on the street or leave their homes, going to safer areas away from the Gaza Strip to escape the missile and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the border with Gaza, where a fragment of the Palestinian mine killed a 4-year-old boy, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border that has grown considerably since the Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study carefully and said, “We will do everything we can to give you the knowledge and ensure your safety.”
Israel and Hamas agreed to a cease-fire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas’ demand to lift the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel challenges these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants launched 4591 rockets and mines in Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of the Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip have been damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 250,000 people have found refuge in more than 100 schools that have been converted into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters, and the fighting continued, officials in charge of education postponed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope that the school will soon open so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza’s schools.
According to the popular criterion, the price of real estate showed the greatest winter growth in seven years.
The price index of housing RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices in the Australian capital grew by 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This increase led to a combined increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than twice as high as 12 months before August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Research Director Data Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are leading a two-tiered market.
RP Data figures show that housing prices in Sydney have risen by 16.1 percent over the past year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 percent.
The next most powerful markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose on average from five to six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which saw government spending cuts, where prices rose by just 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties on sale over the next few months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the current high speed of auction sales, the overall high speed of sales, and current conditions with a low interest rate, it is likely that the cost of housing will still increase in the next three months,” he said.
How people live in the oldest house of Ufa
In the former house of goldsmiths and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (former Bolshaya Kazanskaya) 18 apartments.
The house of the 18th century has practically not changed since the construction, except for the speed.
Foreigners go here as a tour, and residents suffer more than they rejoice, from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufim house, whose walls remember Colonel Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is uncertain, historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is without a small 300-year-old.
The old courtyard, always open the door, the escalator.
The doors of the apartments are located close to each other, the walls are shaken, and in the light of the plastered places there is a street.
I think it’s all in the honest word.
And the locals say, “You don’t think that’s the case.”
Living in an 18th century wooden house is very difficult, - says Tatyana Lukyanov, resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is in the state treasury, but the money for its contents is not allocated for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits, which the authorities simply forgot about.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still poorly maintained, but the foundation has swallowed up.
Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and wash once a week in the public bathroom.
How can you be happy in such circumstances?
The road passes directly under the windows, there is not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana pulls off the curtain.
Now you can see what was only heard before: under the windows there is a flow of cars.
You see, the glass is constantly scratching, we can't open the windows, but we're used to the noise.
People get used to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to my husband, his hands are golden.
What's more, we have two rooms, three living with our son.
And other families have conditions much worse, on the second floor in general the ceilings are a little more than half a meter high.
In contrast, Tatiana offers to visit a neighbor from apartment No. 6 Ludmila Staristina.
A pleasant hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile says:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live: we have a husband and a daughter with a granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, there's never been another place to live, - Ludmila is surrounded by the eyes of the room: antresoli, two sofas with the letter "g"; on one of them was a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very close and little is different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical".
But it regularly flows from the ceiling: the plumbing system is not suitable anywhere.
Ludmila talks about her apartment as usual and amazing at the same time as an Italian, whose house stands on the Roman ruins.
That is to say, it boils down to one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The plumbing was carried out about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in a corner and a toilet from a former hearth.
We live right where Demidov and his family lived, on the second floor there were servants.
Our apartment is not privatized, so why?
At the Ufa Real Estate Center, they say privatisation does not matter.
We still get only one-bedroom apartment, we can't claim for more.
Four months ago, we were promised to move, but the promise didn't go any further.
I'm not used to complaining, and I won't.
In this apartment (the room!) lived a whole dynasty: my grandmother with my grandfather, my mother with my father, I with my husband and my daughter with my granddaughter.
Everything happened during that time.
For example, healthy rats ran in the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the fuselage, they're a metre thick!
It is said that the solution was mixed on the eggs, so it lasts so long.
The house is built thoroughly, thank you Demidov!
Maybe that's the only reason he hasn't killed anyone on the roof or on his own.
Only the construction still slowly dies in our eyes: boards and log houses rot, the floors repeatedly failed, we poured cement, but everything useless - the solution goes to the ground, like a well.
They say it is, and so it is - under our room a secret laze and walk to the White River, which was specially made by the ancients who once lived here, so that you can hide from the danger, in case.
They were persecuted.
Ludmila Starostina tells how a historian came to them, begged to let him start the excavation in the apartment.
And then he convinced them to give them a place to live in exchange for his niece on the prospectus of October.
Ludmila denied the historian:
Where are we on the 4th?
But here, at least, there is a small hope that will give housing more spacious.
If we agreed to exchange, we would not have won anything.
However, the family of the Elders did not win anything.
Ludmila’s biggest dream was to move them, and her daughter with a 16-year-old granddaughter was given a separate room.
That is, two families have allocated a two-room apartment instead of the most majestic ruins, in which two generations now live.
Cute, miniature girl Olesya Karsakova from apartments No 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two narrow rooms with a total area of 23 m2, named apartments, lives its large family.
There are seven of us, two children.
You can see for yourself what conditions.
The plaster rolls off pieces, as well as window frames, in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms through holes.
The water in the tap is cold all year round.
Walking through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, you can make sure that most of the wives of Lavrentiev from apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, lots of places!
Room in 75 square meters, prescribed by three people.
We live in the rooms where Suvorov was staying while he was in Ufa, according to legend, says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentiev.
The sinks are high, spacious.
One bad thing - everything around cracks on the seams, collapses, collapses.
Maybe the neighbors have already told us!
Most of the torture we have with the floor: the wooden boards collapsed, the ground literally disappeared from under the feet.
I've put in brackets, wedges; there's nothing in the room yet, and in another room we walk like we're climbing on the heels, so everything's shackled.
About the home of the buyer Evdokim Demidov Alexander Dmitrievich can tell better than any tour guide.
The goldsmith is treated as a native, he talks about it with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was unstoppable: the owner of the Kagin and Uzyan factories built houses, poured guns and bells, held Ural mines.
The heirs of the buyer’s real estate are proud of their ancestors, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I lived here as a child in the 40s of the 20th century,” says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then there were wooden rooms for carriages, horseshoes and court boxes, which were later demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to remove our house, but something prevented...
The story repeats itself in 2014: once again a new home is left behind.
We, as a team, collected all the documents, bypassed the necessary instances, and suddenly learned that the move to the apartment is postponed to 2015 or 2016.
Something we don't believe in anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
Residents did not accept it.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as in a smile, they issued a paper without a signature and a stamp: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the settlement of the inhabitants".
I even got the feeling that our house is long gone in terms of the city, because first it was number 57, then it was 57 A, and now 57/1.
It was as if it had been removed in the 1970s.
The “Russian Planet” addressed the leading sector of information and analytical work of the management of land resources of Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the program of settlement of old housing.
I cannot be held responsible for the actions of the officials of the 1970s, but I know that at that time there was a plan to demolish all the old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value - is successfully implemented.
Soon, the residents are planning to move to new apartments.
According to Barabash, the restoration of the Demidov House will be by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of the buildings in Venice.
Now there is an architectural biennale in Italy, and the project "Old Ufa" is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire former Old Kazan Street will be restored, - says the official.
The houses will acquire a suitable species, corresponding to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
The Demidov House is likely to be a museum open to all who wish.
In addition, at the government level, it was decided to make the street on weekends on foot.
On the weekend, unfortunately, it will not work, too much loading of roads in the city.
Moving people from the future museum Vladimir Barabas promises in 2015.
However, it is unlikely that they will remain satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Only from a different era.
In Primorye, a forest fire started because of the threat
Drought caused a forest fire on the territory of the Okhotnych forest in the Pozhar region of the Primorsky region.
At the site of the fire there is an increase in the grouping of forces and means.
According to the KGSBU's leadership, the "Primary Air Base", created at the site of the fire, conditions require the attraction of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Head of Air Base:
The fire, which occurred in a hard-to-reach area, was discovered by an observer pilot on board an An-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
The remains of wood are burning on the old burner.
The strong fragility of the territory and the curvature of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the absence of suitable for the landing of paratroopers-firefields create considerable difficulty in extinguishing.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The delivery of forces at the disposal of the airbase by the Mi-2 helicopter and the An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the discovery of the fire at the place of concealment, 4 paratroopers were promptly planted.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional firepower and means.
In the area of lunch in the area of the village of Ohotnichi by helicopter 3 firefighters are delivered.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the fire area is ready, specialists will be transferred to the hiding place, according to the website of the Primorsky Krai administration.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to a family of immigrants from Jamaica to Dudley to the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses the comedy, "Rare Rudy's Records", which is based in part on imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from a series of broadcasts on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, and the melodies are lively.
However, Henry had to go through some difficult memories of his childhood.
After his mother's death there was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often thinks about his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice: "Stop making noises.
Stay away from your sister.
Move it!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket strike.
I've never talked to him like that.
He was such a smiling guy in the corner who read to the newspaper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a foundry shop in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than in his father’s days, he was able to look at what his life was supposed to be like.
Now there's a little bit better, but it's dark, smokey, labyrinth depths of the underworld with flares of fire and smoke and piles of sage.
My father went to the bathroom and just lay there, and you heard him slowly start singing about himself because he wanted to wash away from the ironing shop.
When I got there, I realized that he was doing it for years and years to earn us a living, and I started to appreciate him more.
However, Henry came out of his childhood deprived of parental love.
My father never hugged me, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got sick at the end of her life did we start saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, by Don French, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why shouldn't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with Frank, whom he's been married to for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I make friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of those people who killed her.
So when I got very, very well and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
Then I started serious fitness classes, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
The change in Henry's career trajectory is reflected, perhaps, in his noble, short-cut beard.
Ever since he received critical acclaim for his Othello, he has been fully immersed in the theater.
It was followed by The Comedy of Errors, and then by The Temptations of August Wilson.
This work differs from sitcoms and comedies, which were an integral attribute of his saturated professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
Dickey noticed how he was parodiing on stage, and wrote about him in The New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: “For quite a long time I was the only black parody/comedy on television.”
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in the public eye, I had to learn to be an effective machine for delivering jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in The New Faces in 1975
Since his manager was entitled to the "Black and White Show of the Monsters", a light entertainment program in which people "blackened their faces", Henry found out what was in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I don't think I'd ever want it to be with me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, deplorable position, I worked in large venues and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was “the award-winning light entertainment classic on British television for years and years” was also “a grotesque parody of black people.”
Representing the characters who were also fascinated by the culture of black people in the UK and chanted it, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of "The Lenny Henry Show" aired in 1984, and in the 1990s it was known as, among other things, chief chef Geret Blackock from the comedy series "Chef!".
The commercials, documentaries, TV shows, and movie roles took the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC series in 2008 "LennyHenry.tv", he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because you're going to be a little slow or you're going to be a little slow?"
Next was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 entitled "What's Good in...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I've had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
I can’t be said to have been taught this in school, and I thought it was, in many ways, a prerogative of middle-class white people with panties and hoodies at the bottom of the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the broadcast, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, “You have to try.
Don't do that until you know what you're talking about.
Listen to some of these words, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Othello's last monologue for documentary transmission, and stuck it.
I felt like I could do it.
It's like my head's been fixed.
“This is what it is, it’s a serious matter, take it seriously, study your text, do a little research.
So, the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we put it in.
And she was successful.
It seemed like they were waiting for a disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started the "Error Comedy."
All of a sudden, I'm at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that it was his business to entertain the audience.
“A quiet voice inside me said, ‘You’ll have to work 10 minutes while they’re making a computer.’”
Instead, the assistant director announced that the performance would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I went off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my duty.
I can let someone else deal with this.
"You play the part, stay in the role."
Henry at the "Zabor" at the Dachess Theatre
It was difficult to learn the text for the "Conclusions".
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscles.
It was also well received, so it was like a sign above showing, "That's what you need to do."
He says this, of course, with a huge voice.
So I stick to it.
I really like it.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has the thought of a comedian - all the way through our conversation, bursts of his humor, when he starts, he ends up parodying.
I just decided not to work in the booth, because this thing with instant reward from a full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you try to do this all the time, it can get in the way.
I sometimes work in "Alive on Apollo" when I want to, but mostly I don't get as much pleasure as I used to.
I wonder if he'll ever give a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle, and end of the road – I don’t think I’ll ever want to give up.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You're always telling a story, but here's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya has started biometric registration of all government employees in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the government’s payment statement.
Employees who are not registered for the next two weeks will no longer be paid, the government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after they left the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has promised to reduce corruption in state structures after coming to power in 2013.
The audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) per month is missing due to payments to “invisible workers” and other financial violations.
The government suspects that salaries continue to go to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, BBC reporter Vanyam Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi, reports.
All government employees must appear in the identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, the government statement said.
Anyone who does not do so without a good reason will be removed from the payment statement, it is reported.
"This procedure significantly contributes to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of government employees, and will also be used to clear the payment statement at both levels of the government - therefore, the termination of the problem of "secretaries-in-secretaries", the "secretary-in-secretary", will be used.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested in connection with 'conspiracy' against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government,” local news agencies say.
The police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them took part in last December's corruption detection activities, which were aimed at verifying government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of creating an organized criminal group and listening to the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an (who at the time was prime minister) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power, Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1st) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told the expected journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1st, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky above every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian people’s front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, the director of the school in Slavyansk, to which Yatsenyuk’s daughter went, spoke in Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive the knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of school is traditionally marked by the fact that children wear embroidered shirts, hold air balloons in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhed, the BBC may have found such an impressive leader that she needs.
It is followed by a slice of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal circles of the Tori party.
In fact, she has her own experience working in leadership positions.
Her career began at a global management consulting firm Bain and Co, and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, retiring when a senior position at Pearson’s head company was held by a male colleague who held a lower position.
It is said that her earnings are approaching <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Their political rankings are also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, the former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector specialists to Whitehall: she became an adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory advisor.
Earlier in May, I called the job of the president of the poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two directions: inside as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also outside as a voice of public concern and concern when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopoly, which requires complete radical reform.
But what kind of new president would risk coming, dissolving and destroying the institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty, if he himself would lose his job in the process.
It's a tough decision.
It wouldn’t be that difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC shrink in size – after reviewing its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, inevitable negotiations about the cost of the license pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British acquire a stake in arguably the largest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it states that the results of its work cover 96 percent of households and cost each of them just 40p a day.
What’s more, it’s clear that Beeb’s popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today versus 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC’s viewing and use patterns have changed: now I get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope he found him.
Perry, from Texas, says a humiliating tweet was written by a stranger
A tweet from Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s confirmed account on Sunday night contained an insulting image of a district attorney from Democrats, who is at the center of a criminal prosecution for alleged abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, followed by another one from Perry's account, in which this record was decrypted.
Just a tweet was posted from my account, which was written by someone foreign.
“I don’t approve of this tweet, and I deleted it,” the later post reads.
Perry's assistants did not immediately respond to messages with a request to comment.
Although the recordings were downloaded from Perry’s confirmed account, it was unclear who was actually publishing on the tape.
Earlier in the day, the tweet contained a caricature of the district attorney Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who was found guilty of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on funding her department when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury hearing in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
“I don’t always drive a car in a state of intoxication that’s three times the permissible level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I accuse Governor Perry of telling me about it.”
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg Office did not conduct an investigation with the participation of a grand jury against Perry.
They were engaged by Michael McKrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry did not find himself guilty and called the charges a political trap.
His powerful legal team asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, saying that the law used to prosecute the governor, who has performed his duties for the longest time in Texas’s history, would dilute what is contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding $7.5 million from the state's Public Control Division, which is based in Travis County and is pursuing corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to step down.
Veto has raised an official complaint from a left-leaning public control group.
Perry’s confirmed account tape is often updated – and sometimes becomes famous.
Coming to the party's fifth convention in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he could get out of the game by posting a tweet with a photo of himself running by the lake and saying, "Here we go, South Carolina!"
Berkeley says the real estate market has returned to a “normal state”
One of London’s most famous developers has warned that the real estate market in southeastern England has “returned” to a normal level of activity.
Houses in the capital were the subject of lively demand and rapidly rising prices, with widespread fears that a credit bubble would push the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of this financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels from the peak of 2013,” adding that it has provided a “stable working environment.”
The London real estate market was successful during the decline, as foreign buyers flocked to the capital.
The city's prices jumped 18.5 percent in just one year, according to the Land Cadastre, significantly surpassing the average of 6.7 percent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for private, affordable and student schemes in Berkeley rose by about one-fifth last year, reaching <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London’s real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of which have also stopped the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around the potential “house tax” ahead of the next general election.
Last week, the London real estate agency Foxtons warned that April’s mortgage market reform, which introduced tougher loan terms, would also entail a decline in market growth as a purchase-sale transaction of real estate and real estate.
Recent data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has cut its forecast for London real estate price growth for 2015 to 3 percent based on the fact that real estate price sentiment has already begun to weaken.
Transaction volumes have fallen by a quarter compared to the previous year in London’s most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, demand for a home in the capital proved to be very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales volumes of more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pigley added: “The demand for the right product with a good design and a better location remained the same and, reflecting this, sales for the term were maintained.”
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes this year until the end of April — almost a third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
Annual income before tax payments rose by 40 percent compared to the previous year to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million, income by 18 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
Speaking on Monday ahead of the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that Berkeley’s projected revenue for this year will meet current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, profits are expected for the whole year before taxes are paid in the amount of <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
The stock price of Berkeley stood at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in the second half of the day on the London Stock Exchange.
Photos of the naked Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual award ceremony of the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts.
The photos of the nude actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscars, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who assures that she has a “catalogue” of photos of another 100 rising stars.
The star of the Hunger Games confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real, and condemned the hacker for "sudden intrusion into private space."
An appeal has been received to law enforcement, and they will prosecute anyone who publishes stolen photographs of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan photo-sharing site, were allegedly obtained due to a lack of Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalogue" of the victims of the hack includes names of dozens of female celebrities, including Carney and Carney.
It is unclear how many of these photos are genuine, although the star of Scott Pilgrim vs. Everyone, Winsted, on Twitter, also condemned the burglary.
“To those who look at the photos we took with my husband a few years ago, when we were alone at home, I hope you’re proud of yourself,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justis of Nickolodeon’s series “iCarly” and “Victoria-Winner” denied that in the photos she wrote on Twitter: “This so-called nude photo of me is FALSE, people.
Let me stop this in the womb. <0xE2><0x99><0xAA> Callumbur intended <0xE2><0x99><0xAA>
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that a representative of pop star Ariana Grande denied that the photos, on which she allegedly is, were genuine.
An exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson’s new novel about love and the letter “J” that caused praise from critics
They dissolved, best of all, they gradually collapsed like a cardboard box, which was left in the rain.
Only occasionally did a woman tell him that he was too serious, heavy in communication, tense, closed, and maybe a little annoying.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw irritability in himself.
He was a jerk, like a hawk, yeah.
The last victim of this cowardice was a small novel, from which he waited more than usual, deliverance from a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a slender, brittle beauty with brittle hair and a trembling heart from a northern island village, even farther away and harsher than Port Roiben.
She came to the south with a satellite older than herself, which Keavern considered her aunt, while the latter received in her inheritance a house in a raw, but paradise-like valley called the "Paradise Valley".
No one lived in the house for a few years.
The pipes were leaking, the bathrooms were immobile with spiders, the mussels left their footprints on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was filled with ants, similar to giant goat cabbages.
It was like a cottage from a children’s book, both scary and charming, with a full secret garden.
Author's View: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the 2014 Booker Prize longlist.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Eilinn sat, holding their hands, in their broken sledgehammer among the tall grass, enjoying the unexpectedly warm spring day; they both connected to the cheap console, which supplied the country with soothing music, reassuring and relaxing
You've got too big legs.
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type on the console were no longer lost.
They weren’t banned – nothing was actually banned – they just weren’t lost anymore.
They helped to become archaic, as the word “archaic” itself.
The public taste did what would never have been achieved by orders and prescriptions, and just as among the books people chose the memoirs of the rich, who grew up in poverty, culinary books and love novels, they chose ballads from all music.
Infatuated with this day, Cavern began playing on an imaginary piano and a rough comedic voice singing the big legs of Eilyn.
Eileen didn't understand.
“It was a popular song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller,” he told her by mechanically applying two fingers to her lips.
So his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she fell off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start the word with "J" by forgetting to put two fingers in your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game then, and it wasn’t very fun now.
He knew what was waiting for him, that’s all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailenn had never heard of him.
Jazz didn't play either, although he wasn't openly banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There is only one “if” in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with oysters.
His unpredictability has affected people’s nerves.
And jazz was an oyster, expressed by means of music.
Although he reached the age of 10, having never heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Cavern knew about jazz from his father’s semi-secret compact disc collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
The society was obedient, and this meant that every segment of it agreed with gratitude - thanks to those who saved their fate - with the principle of group predisposition.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent in temperament and physical characteristics were well suited to the sphere of entertainment and sport - and they sang and ran.
Originators from Indostan, as if they were naturally talented in everything related to electronics, took it upon themselves to ensure that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was engaged in sanitary work; what was left of the Greek was plates.
The exiles from the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country, and when he, what was done, was done, in fear that they would be blamed for the burning of the flame, in fear,
Everyone according to their abilities.
Since she had only heard the scores before, Eileen was hard to understand how insulting words that Keavern had just whispered to her could have been put on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
“They’re not really insulting,” Keavern said.
Maybe it’s for people who have big feet.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the garden he was running gave him the illusion of safety.
Not a single word could penetrate through the sound insulation of the giant leaves, similar to the cabbage leaves.
Eileen didn't understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn’t want to press two fingers to her lips again.
She already thought it was strange.
"He thought it was funny," he said instead.
She shook her head incredulously, closing Keverna's review.
There was nothing in the world but the land of her black hair.
Nothing he'd like to look at.
"Well, if you say so," she said, remaining with her opinion.
But it still doesn't explain why you're eating it for me.
She seemed to be really upset.
Do I have too many legs?
He looked at them again.
I can't say no.
The boats, maybe a little...
And you say you hate me because my thighs are too thick?
Do I hate you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
“I like you because you have thick thighs,” he tried to say instead.
I've got this kind of perversion.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often led him into awkward situations, because, like his father, he lacked that soothing charm that could alleviate the cruelty that was going on in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Cavern, wanted to too.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and rose from the chaise longue, shoving the console and poured the wine they drank.
The wine came from the buffalo, so the intoxication could not serve as an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to be shaking like palm leaves in a hurricane.
“And I like you because you have a stupid head,” she said.
Even if you don't like it.
He was sorry for her, both because of the excessive harshness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she resisted him.
Did she think he was going to hit her?
She did not talk to him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he did not doubt that in the main characters she was similar to the one here.
The same huge ice-ocean crashed on both of them.
The same men, even more sensitive and capricious after that, what is the cause, are the cause of the world than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, have driven them madly from the pub to the pub, willing to raise their hands to the pub, ready to raise them.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid doll if she wasn't careful!
At first we would have kissed – kissing has now become the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; antidote to the fresh ballads issued by the console – first to kiss her, and then to punch her.
It is an overstatement, according to Kevern, because the kiss itself was already a hooliganism.
Eileen Solomons' body showed that he had to leave.
He rose from the saddle like an old man.
She herself felt the weight of lead, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched as he walked away, and from the top window she watched as he walked away, her companion - a man who himself took on the burden.
Adam, who was leaving the garden, thought.
She felt the sting of compassion for him and the men in general, though some of them raised their hands on her.
The man who turned away from her, with his back bent, strangled, battled, all the ability to fight left him – why did she think she knew it so well, if she could not remember a single case, until today, when she saw such a thing?
Once again, Eileen Solomon looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above or so, Esme Nussbaum, a clever and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Offnau, an informal public mood control service, has been preparing a small report on the preservation of low and medium levels of violence, has been relapsed, has not been relapsed, has been relapsed in the same frequency.
"A lot has been done, and a lot is done," she wrote, "to alleviate the innate aggressiveness of people who have fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these scattered branches and narrow plantations of the area, where, despite the rustling of weeds above the bush, there has been a good harvest.
However, some qualities appear to be inexhaustible.
The higher the spire, the lower the passions that it generates.
The population sheds tears over the sentimental ballads, swallows the stories about the obstacles that have been overcome, and proclaims about its zeal for the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip both in the rural communities and in the town.
“You have a boring habit of writing too much,” her scientific supervisor said, reading the report as a whole.
I think you should read less of the novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask you: are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I have to answer,” Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I ask," said Luther Rabinowitz, "not because I am against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We have no prejudices here.
We are servants of a society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and commendable in itself, can sometimes distort the results, such as the ones you showed me.
It is obvious that you yourself are presumptuous against the church, and what you call “evil” and “grave,” others would interpret as an expression of natural vitality and energy.
To continue to offer what is right, what is wrong, what is wrong is wrong, as if it happened, if at all, yesterday, is to deprive the country of the life force it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked at the sides while Rabinovitz spoke.
Behind his head pink, like flamingo, the LED letters repeated the tips that Offnau gave the country for the last quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Conversation is better than silence, the word of a song is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
“I completely understand what you’re trying to say,” said Esme Nussbaum, when she realized that her scientific supervisor had finished speaking, “and I don’t want to say anything except that we didn’t heal as effectively as we convinced ourselves.
I’m concerned that if we’re not ready, we’ll find that we’re repeating the mistakes that originally led to TOMU, what’s right, what’s wrong is wrong.
Only this time will we cast our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinovitz connected the tips of the fingers to the pyramid.
This gesture should have meant infinite patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “calling the ‘mistakes’ of actions that our grandfathers have or have not done.
You go too far and when you talk about that they have thrown their “angry” and “distrust” at “others.”
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that, understanding the past, that is, protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” and “them”.
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of trouble – that’s all we know.
“For which, if you are honest with yourself,” Esme ventured, “no part of society can justify itself well.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was good or bad, what was done was done.
It was then.
There’s nothing more to say – here we agree.
And since you don’t have to blame anyone, you don’t have to justify yourself if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why the past, if not in order to learn -
The past exists in order for us to forget it.
If I can add one word to this--
The pyramid of Luther Rabinovich has collapsed.
"I'll look into your report," he said, dismissing her.
The next day, on the way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who went on the sidewalk, as the passers-by described, "in an angry rage."
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho’s army says coup was not planned; the prime minister remains in South Africa
Representatives of the Lesotho army denied the fact of preparing for a coup aimed at overthrowing the government, saying they were acting against the police, which they suspected in an attempt to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, saying the country’s army surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, saying he had received a threat from an attempt on his life.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was not, in fact, a coup, but that the army was responding to a threat from "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Forces command took action, receiving several intelligence reports that among the police forces there are some elements that he really planned to arm some of the political, young political fanatics he had been.
A representative of the South African government, Clayson Monella, said the army’s actions looked like a coup.
“Although no one has claimed to seize power by force, the actions of Lesotho’s armed forces at the moment have the main signs of a coup,” he said.
Army representatives from Lesotho said the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motejoa Metsing is running the government in the absence of Taban.
Tabane said he believed he was under attack in an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his unified government.
He stated that his actions were not undermined by the government, despite accusations in reverse.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on rent rights in Milan, Milan Channel reports.
A 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for a medical examination.
Last season, he went on the field as a member of the London club only three times.
Let’s recall that Milan previously rented from Liverpool the attacking Fernando Torres.
Production in the euro area at the lowest level in 13 months
Production growth in the euro area slowed to the lowest rate in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the Eurozone’s business activity index (PMI) fell to a mark of 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates an increase.
The new orders were delayed, and the companies suffered amid growing tensions between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The figures came before a meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will wait for the bank to come up with a clear plan on how to deal with the eurozone’s stoppage, as well as the threat of deflation in inflation, which is only 0.3%.
The ECB’s head, Mario Draghi, is expected to give additional signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the euro area similar to those used by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“While some growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more apparent,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The PMI of Germany’s manufacturing sector, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest in 11 months to a mark of 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc’s second-largest economy, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause real concern, as does Italy’s weakening from steady growth to stagnation.
The signs that the growth momentum of the tailgate is mainly industrial, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add confidence,” Mr Dobson said.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to still put oil on the fire for analysts waiting for the introduction of additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August study of the eurozone’s business activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: "The producers of the euro area obviously find life very difficult at the moment, as the current rising geopolitical tension - especially associated with Russia/Ukraine - adds uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit businesses – and especially consumers’ confidence, and is likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that “it’s more like” that the ECB will, of course, have to conduct some sort of quantitative easing, “although we suspect it will be limited.”
The residents of Mariupol will put a living chain against the militias
In Mariupol until last week everything was calm - no one bothered to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Azov Sea lived and worked.
Now residents are eagerly waiting for the arrival of the “halflings”.
According to political scientists, the separatists break into Mariupol to get out to the Sea of Azov - recently the city of Novoazovsk was taken, which was also not part of the self-proclaimed republics before.
The Mariupols decided that the Ukrainian army, although it would protect them, but the forces had little against the excellent armed representatives of the DPR-LNR, and gathered to help the military.
They roar the trenches, build blockposts and fortifications.
On Saturday evening, several thousand residents came to the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a living chain, singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They will do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and carry equipment and products, collect medicines, publish a newspaper.
In the city, shops are gradually closed, banks and ATMs stop working.
10 years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: 10 years since the school’s brutal capture, like the children who found themselves in it, are still suffering
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day trial that shocked the world.
We're back in Beslan to find some of the victims who lied about their death during a schoolyard.
Exactly ten years after the terrible seizure of the Beslan school, during which 334 people died, including 186 children, heroically survived the disaster, warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed like something of the extreme degree of possible evil.
The tragedy has united the East and the West in disgust, which has miraculously then grown into action and hope for the future in the midst of severe grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in the south of Russia to find some of the victims who lied about death during a schoolyard.
We have found amazing young people who have faced adversity, even though memories of a terrorist ade will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war, which is now terrifying Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now cease.
The girl who in the photo is trying to get back to the shooting sports hall
It is captured in a photograph of the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, when in one piece of clothing she tried to go back to the shooting sports hall after the explosion of the mine.
In despair, Aida desperately sought out her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that both of them were dead, but in fact they survived.
“The woman told me to run away, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My feet were covered in blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of operations, she thought she had recovered completely, but yesterday she said: “Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I may need more surgery.
There are a few pieces left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people just as the doctors helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn’t break it,” she says with a challenge.
“This has happened to me, and this fact cannot be changed.
Once a year I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmates, Dzer Gapoev was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed we were going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the seizure remains with her, although the memories fade slightly every year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from the UK and elsewhere.
When I see a picture on the Internet where I’m leaning in the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make sure it doesn’t happen again.
A boy who ran through a bullet town believing his mother was dead.
It was his first day at school (the Russians start school at 7 years old) and he survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mama told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the road, grabbed the child by the hand and ran through the city of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son from the outside, said: “Damir told me his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and was in a hospital with leg injuries, in turn thinking that her son had died.
After their reunion, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran and embraced me.
Damira was later brought to London (now a non-existent newspaper News of the World), where he was awarded as a Child Protector from the Barnardo Foundation's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sherry.
“This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it,” he said yesterday.
Still, I can say that in my memory, it disappears.
I remember right after that I threw out all my toy weapons.
But now I can play computer shooting games, and that’s not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard who never got out.
We never say they are killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store, where I was allowed to choose everything I wanted, and a trip in an open top car.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars lead to a mountain that he and his friends have survived.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
“I am so sorry to all those who suffer from these horrors,” said Damir, who was volunteering at a women’s monastery last week.
That's how I want to help.
I want to be a police officer someday, and I hope to be admitted to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: “37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the ghastly silence immediately after the seizure, there were just no children who would scream and run around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She clearly remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I realized then how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to Sherry Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember how, when Damir wanted to eat broth, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shot them from his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And it was only a month after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so ready to share our pain and support us.
She said: “I don’t think this world has gotten any better in these 10 years.
Now there is a war going on in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for many people war is a news report that they listen to when they’re bored or when they’re busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he is not aggressive at all and not evil.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not stuck in this past nightmare.
I know he doesn’t like to remember him, but they’re very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from this – I remember him lying on the couch turning away from us for hours.
He did not sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw out all his weapons and other military toys. Damiru is now 17, he is above me, nice, smart and healthy.
I find it hard to believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he died and that I will never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and stand on my feet, I looked, I saw hell around me when parts of the body lay everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
“I remember yelling at him, ‘Damir, run, run, run,’ but again I was so sure he didn’t hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgiy Ilyin, 17 years old
The boy whose shocking photo after the capture became decisive for the tragedy in Beslan
Peace: the survivor Beslan Georgiy Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004, and Georgiy's right today
On his bloody face was a sign of fear when he was saved from death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, the chief physician, took him to school on the first day of school before taking his eldest son Vladimir to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy stayed one for three days in a nightmare,” she recalled.
Not quite alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only George was able to survive it.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of those days are always in front of me.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
The photo of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in sculpture (right)
I remember Georgie was so eager to go to school that day that he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of George crying in San Marino.
George doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but it also seems to me that thanks to this photo people from all over the world feel our pain.
George now says, “It’s important that it never happened again.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
Now they are investigating this collapse of the Boying in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what it was called?
The world is going to something very bad.
“I can’t understand how this happens because if you ask people, no one wants war, because it happens?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need it to take decades to forget it a little bit.
It has affected my health and I still feel it.
About three or four years ago I had nightmares because of the seizure, but now it's getting better.
I went back to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That’s why I keep going to this gym before every September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won’t forget that, but I don’t feel sorry for myself.
My life continues.
I graduated from school this year and entered the medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to study to become a cardiologist.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won’t happen.
Georgiy Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived despite being at the feet of a terrorist-killer
Unbelievable: Georgiy Farniev was at the feet of a terrorist-killers during the capture, but still managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a terrorist-killer.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
“It seems to us that it was still yesterday,” says Georgii, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB, but could not because of the damage that was done to his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children are easily coped with bad events, - I have to say it's not true.
“In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget that.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 – the following year – it was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I've lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don’t ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous photo.
Survived: Georgiy Farniev today with an open photo of himself in the hospital after the seizure
My pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for my physical condition, I am healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm walking normally.
But still, my health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical records, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, “I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
It’s not what children need to know, and it’s certainly not what they need to live through.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate it.
I know George won't go.
For him, she must be even stronger because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me. Here in Beslan, the imprint is on everyone.
He stays with us.
George is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It’s hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He had several surgeries, he could walk, but he could not do sports.
I would say that he has overcome this nightmare by 50%, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and that only exacerbates my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could have given me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I also know widows who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on even if you don’t want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what’s going on in the world – wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I find it hard to believe.
We were one friendly country in the past, how did it turn out that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If it were possible to capture all the rebels and throw them away - as far as possible.
Alena Tskaeva, 10 years old
The baby, which was moved to a safe place by a special forces fighter
Saved: Alena Tskaev is taken to a safe place by a Russian special forces fighter (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember the monster crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when a Russian policeman took the little Allon out of the seized school in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but she was brutally left by her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Christina and brother Mahara in the school's sports hall.
Mahar, who was three years old at the time, was rescued, but Alena's mother and sister were killed in a deadly battle.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried, and they have a little daughter with his new wife Svetlana, whom he called Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alon, who is now ten, remembers nothing about the capture and has grown into a smart and lively girl, the neighbors say.
“They’re a big happy family now, and Alena and Mahar are both beautiful children,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Half-back Sindhi Kagawa, who has returned from Manchester United to Dortmund’s Borussia, said he was looking forward to returning to the field in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyful event in a career.
Of course, I am very happy that I will play for "Borussia" again, - Bild quotes the words of Kagawa.
I feel very good.
Full of positive emotions and I look forward to being able to come out on the field again in the form of "Borussia".
Recall, Kagava transferred to the "MU" from "Borussia" in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he never managed to become a member of the English club, having played only 38 games in the English championship in two seasons, scoring 6 balls and giving 8 successful transfers.
A man accused of going to a girl on a pedestrian crossing "pelican" in Fife
A 78-year-old man will face trial on charges of navigating a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly shot the girl at the crossing in Pittenwin, East New York.
Prosecutors said Mr. Stewart drove his Audi Q3 without proper care and attention and hit the girl, resulting in her injury.
Stuart, 78, from Anstruter, denied his guilt at the Dandy Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, a royal lawyer, set a court date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande will not open in Vladivostok
The duty-free trade store of Vladivostok airport has hung a sign prohibiting the making of purchases in this store of a number of world political leaders.
Don't open them with spirits, vodka and cognac.
The store’s administration has decided that U.S. President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande, Vitaly Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other well-known friends will not be able to open themselves to vodka, cognac and spirits.
And she hung a corresponding sign on the door.
Earlier, Obama received a ban on appearing in an even less accessible service to him by the type of institution - Dietetic Tables ICU, which the institution's website reported.
Whether the U.S. president has ever dreamed of eating at a dietary table in Russia is unknown, but the authors of the ban clearly seem to themselves terribly witty.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
The Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev believes that under the conditions of the embargo, Russian agrarians should master new technologies in order to arrange the release of the varieties demanded from the buyers of cheeses.
The council was given during the visit of the enterprise "Yugpticeprom" of the company "Agrocomplex".
The head of the government also gave advice to restaurateurs to refocus on Russian meat, the quality of which is at the right level.
The annual embargo on food imports has been introduced in Russia since August 7.
The head coach of the Russian team Valentin Maslakov is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, the third place is a good result given the lack of targeted preparation for the competitions.
Our athletes have performed at their level, - says the "All sport" of the word Maslakov.
Third place is the confirmation of our sufficiently high command level.
It is a pleasure that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
We must bear in mind that we are not prepared for these competitions.
The season is over, and we didn’t commit our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years we have become second in this tournament, but this season we have renewed the team.
The French, on the other hand, exhibited a combatable team, which included 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which they have repeatedly publicly announced.
But even such a composition of the owners of the competition could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians performed in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were in the order below that of the same "Brilliant League".
The season is over.
Of course, athletes are no longer so important a result, especially in team level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, there was an absurdity when at 1500 meters men were so fascinated by the tactical stunts of running that they showed the result below the average level of... women's running.
4 tips on how to achieve the best quality underwater photos and videos
If you want to take a photo or take a video underwater, there are a number of options for the equipment in front of you.
The cheapest option is a waterproof "mill", for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, for example, the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these photos on a family holiday with the help of several cameras, all for about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, several rules need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you will be shooting.
Some cameras have shooting modes or object type that optimize the exposure to dark underwater conditions. <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2>
And before jumping into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can sink.
Some cameras are designed for only 5 feet, others for 50 or 60 feet.
Take a look at our buyer's guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and water-tight models.
Take a few shots - because many of them won't get.
The "mills" have HDDs that will help you compose photos, while the action cameras usually don't.
Even if you have ZKD, it will be difficult to see under water, and the framing will be a random process.
So, do a few shots.
Also, if your camera has a serial shooting mode that takes multiple shots with slightly different exposure settings, take advantage of them.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light is significantly reduced as you dive deeper into the water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you are shooting in the pool, river or ocean.
It will also allow you to transfer more color in the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Navigate closer to the recording facilities.
This is great advice for shooting on land, but it is even more important under water because of the dim light conditions.
Especially important if you’re shooting on an action camera: This device is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you’ll have to get closer to the shooting objects if you want to fill in the shot.
The bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympic Games for the free fight Bilal Mahov can switch to the Greco-Roman fight.
This was reported by the head coach of the Dagestan national team for the free fight Sajid Sajidov.
The specialist did not rule out the athlete's participation in the Tashkent World Championship in September 2014.
Currently, Bilal Makhov is on the team of "classics", - quotes the "R-Sport" word Sajida Sajidov.
In general, according to juniors, Bilal also performed in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championship, he became the winner of the freestyle tournament and the third prize in the Greco-Roman competitions and decided to focus on the free fight.
It has long been said that the new stage of our heavyweight career will take place in the Greco-Roman struggle.
I’ll say more: Makhov can perform at the world championship in Tashkent – if he wins the promotion.
But the decisive word is always about the coaching staff headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality power could shake everything around him, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
A consultant anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to getting rid of both the suffering of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among those who spoke to him, recalls his wife, was an MI-6 officer, who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors are fascinated by diagnoses and diseases, those undergoing treatment are mainly concerned about something completely different - pain.
Once in 2007, however, he turned out to be the one who started suffering.
“I didn’t feel as normal,” he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength in myself.
Struggling with flu-like symptoms, he discovers that he is irritatingly insulting his wife, Juliet.
“I want everything to happen faster, not later,” he said.
When Juliet left for business for a week, Lawson found out that he was unusual and unclear as to why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked his colleague to do chest X-rays.
Just two weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray have arrived.
It was a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to find out the exact cause.
Although some smokers have lung cancer, for example, not all patients with lung cancer have smoked.
But with mesothelioma in a different way.
Almost in all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called a "miracle", but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is a material of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the recommended industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked in close contact with it: plumbers, builders, sealers and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era, it hardly seems to be a cause for concern today.
But that calm is wrong.
The UK appears to be at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
Here more people die from mesothelioma than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual mortality rate of about 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from this disease than as a result of car accidents.
Annual number of deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and projected number of deaths in the future in the UK
The reason why we feel its deadly consequences now is that while the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were ultimately prohibited by law in 1999), the development of mesothelioma usually takes decades.
And the attack of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial construction specialties.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, laid in the house where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, level of abundance, profession or age.
The bastions of choice, from fashionable London universities to private schools, did not turn out to be salvation.
The building of the Parliament is paved with asbestos.
Even the hospitals that were designed to treat us were the reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a plumber.
Actually, he had to think about where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then he concocted.
"It looks like there could have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Gaya Hospital, where I spent six years in the internship," he wrote.
All of them – students, nurses, doctors and freighters – used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers have the same disease?
It was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
“Of the four doctors who were interned at Gaya Hospital who subsequently developed mesothelioma over the past five years,” he said in a 2010 letter, “I alone remained alive.”
How many of us are affected by this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
To live so long is unusual.
Fifty percent of patients with mesothelioma die 8 months after diagnosis.
She's always deadly.
Thus, now we can only repeat the question of Louison: "How many of us will suffer from the same disease?"
According to the leading expert on mesothelioma in the UK, Professor Juliana Pito, it is likely that between 1970 and 2050, when an asbestos epidemic in the UK is to survive itself, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people don’t think they’ll die that way.

A quick look at reports from the courtrooms, where the victims often seek compensation, shows how far the attack of mesothelioma has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that they had unsupervisedly made contact with asbestos.
She worked in the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, managing clothing departments at two facilities, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over the age of 20.
“Before that happened,” she says, “I never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn’t believe that it would affect me.
Very few people really know a lot about asbestos.
Actually, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They got their name from the word "asbestiforms", which means a fibrous structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, widely known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings to this day.
It has been used in roof panels, floor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler seams, even in braking wells of cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health harm” that could lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amozite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
Britain was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that “there are strong, though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the extremely high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK].”

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but the work of Juliana Pitto suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that “a substantial percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known impact at work or at home, was most likely caused by the impact of asbestos from the environment.”
Much of this impact, he says, is due to the “normal use and weather impact” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure that he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even in the center of the government, could have been exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical mines and pipelines behind the premises of parliamentary committees were infected with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be triggered by something as harmless as “strong airflows”.
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems the opposite is true.
Although the Parliament's Technical Service Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace received a "pure sanitary certificate", it now acknowledged that it is necessary to carry out work on the <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion reconstruction of the Parliament, improving the electricity and removing the asbestos in 2015, and everything after that.
Goddard’s report noted that “the asbestos situation was not managed according to different rules.”
It is impossible to know if this error of management will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who has never been able to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital that successfully filed asbestos-related claims,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It is so hard to remember all the places where he worked and the dates.
What he clearly remembers is the day in early December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late in the evening.
All of a sudden, I was starving.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain was coming from the pleura, the shells around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
After all, he couldn’t go to work for a month.
The tasked doctors took X-rays of the chest cell and placed pleural catheters to pull the fluid out of the lungs and send it to the test.
However, his condition was left undiagnosed.
Gradually his health improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time the same symptoms returned, often after he was engaged in sports and breathing heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to him in a hospital with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with "mesothelioma".
However, even then Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
In the end, his patient was ten years older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his doctor consulted him showed his CT and X-ray results to a group of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began feeling ill, a sensor equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the shell of his chest cell and the shell of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going,” he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and the New Year: “I was told it was a mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott: Diagnosed with Mesothelioma
Abbott suddenly went into a meeting with the Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested that he contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
“It turns out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos thermal insulation was quite often on the pipes,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now impresses younger people with unusual professions.
The most dangerous insulated asbestos pipes in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that patients would be injured.
But many employees who walked through the pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or ate in the basement dining room (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to toxic substances.
For several decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were a place where, theoretically, they saved lives for the patients, but a place that posed a threat to life for the doctors who treated them.
It is still being removed today.
Schoolchildren installed their Bunzen burners on asbestos racks
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and halls due to its amazing insulation and fire resistant characteristics.
Schools, too.
In fact, many, most likely, were first exposed to asbestos in the classroom.
Across the country, at countless chemistry classes, schoolchildren installed their Bunzen burners on asbestos racks.
There are websites that pay attention to the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of saras, as a rule, contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison that’s embedded in a huge number of our buildings,” said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Gaya Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could remember was the demolition of the garden shed in the 1970s.
Therefore, be careful, wear garden sarees.
The effect of diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is enormous.
“It takes a lot of time to realize that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I had to go out and deal with myself.
Well, I won't see Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from a doctor’s position to a patient’s position.
As an incalculable number of patients before him, he remembers how he was cut off by the amount of information he had to accept.
“It was hard to know everything,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have?’
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I don't see Christmas anymore.
That's all."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous because it is the mechanics of how we support life – the act of breathing itself – that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is destroyed and fibers are inhaled, they can become trapped in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem is caused by the inhalation of the yellow fibers of asbestos,” said Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Gaia Hospital in 2001.
It was the hospital where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
The surgeon knew about Louson and treated some of the others, who were likely to have been exposed by interns at the hospital.
When the needles of asbestos fall into the tissue of the lungs, Treger says, "breathing pushes them to the periphery where the shell is located.
This is, in essence, an invasive process from the very beginning.
The usual treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, causes hot disputes.
Some people think it’s worth a try.
The manager doesn't agree.
“It’s impossible to cut the pleura,” he says.
It is impossible to walk around with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer "doesn't very well undergo chemotherapy" that "works" but doesn't cure.
“Sometimes there are patients who live a long time,” says Treger.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Writer Steven J. Guld died 20 years after the diagnosis was made.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After suffering from mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after the diagnosis, became a single support and consultation office for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central", he said cheerfully when they called.
“He was very positive,” Abbott says.
He was diagnosed 4 years ago, and he is still very energetic.
At first, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and extend his life for just one month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "had the audacity to give everything a slightly more positive color."
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loik Langz-Lazdunski, a professor of thoracic surgery at Gaya Hospital.
“We had the advantage that I didn’t need directions, I just called them and they accepted me,” Graham admits.
The average patient would have to receive direction and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma to get the best of the available types of treatment.
However, when such treatment finally turns out to be inefficient, many patients face another financial reason for concern - about the future of the families they will leave behind.
And then they go to court for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898,” Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it became clear that even very small amounts could put health at risk.
That’s when we talked about the unfairness of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a "full-fledged settlement," Morgan said, as Lawson could not conclusively prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Guy's hospital.
Following the investigation into his death, a representative of the hospital in Guya confirmed, however, that "asbestos in the basements we were talking about was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, linking deathly contact with asbestos to one company or workplace — usually decades later — has proven to be a major problem for patients with mesothelioma requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers have either replaced the owner or closed down.
The insurance records could have been lost.
And those who are protected from lawsuits know that on their side, which plaintiffs, of course, do not have time.
In response this year, serious new legislation has emerged that facilitates patients with mesothelioma to recover compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under this law, a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million fund, funded by the insurance industry, was created for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact, but who can not be sued.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary compensation case – about <0xC2><0xA3>120000.
About 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million is a “very good job” for the insurance industry.
“This is a deal written by insurers for insurers,” he says, pointing out that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if they didn’t intervene in the interim and patients with mesothelioma could track the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, formerly the Minister of Labour and Pensions, acknowledged that the law was “unfulfilled.”
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that while seven people die each day, rapid action was needed.
“People are suffering so much, and they need help today,” Penning said during Bill’s second reading on mesothelioma in December last year.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loika Langz-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgical intervention, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considered effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - tritherapy, in which Lang-Lazdunski can boast a total of 40 percent of the survivors in five years.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
“It’s certainly one of the most important things,” Abbott says.
You see this in patients all the time.
There is a force that supports you.
When you give up, the condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott was in surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans also showed no sign of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few five [cancers] in my chest.
I should have turned 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
There's no trace of the tumors now.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things - about finances when I die, for example, or about what to show your wife how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you become unhappy.
We need to look forward.
As Ellie's father, 16, and Tamzin, 14, it's not always easy.
“It’s hard for a parent,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease, which means I won’t live to old age.
They reacted in a very different way.
Tamsin is very social and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a lot of calls very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to deal with.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even by the bright possibility of survival.
This disease carries with it (even as, in the end, for Stephen Jay Guld) a dark certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not a threat to life.

China Refuses to Give Hong Kong the Right to Choose Leaders; Protesters Swear to Revenge
China’s parliament on Sunday decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite the growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to start long-promised protests in the Hong Kong business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the All-China Assembly of People’s Representatives, in essence, allows Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
“It didn’t fool our expectations, but it still leads to anger,” said Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They have deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
Defending China's decision, Lee Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the All-China People's Assembly, said allowing the national election of Hong Kong's leader would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain transferred control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the region’s residents to vote for the head of government, starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic step forward as it gives Hong Kongers the right to direct vote; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a moving commission.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision was made after the summer, when some of the largest and most widely publicized protests in Hong Kong took place over many years.
For much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down Hong Kong’s financial district unless Beijing guarantees this universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement is moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they will rise on the wave of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently, in an effort to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement “thought of the possibility of capturing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can be taken only if all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are very sorry to report that, to date, all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the capture of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
The state authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing’s statement for several days, and security measures have been stepped up at the government headquarters on Sunday with police and barricade involvement.
At the heart of the unrest lies the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of residents from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations put business at risk – a source of Hong Kong’s vitality.
“The protest they’re talking about can lead to major economic damage depending on how many people will participate and how long,” said Regina Ip, a lawmaker who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is out of control.
This is a bad idea for investment.
China’s state media also reported on the recent days in which Hong Kong Democratic Movement activists were shown by Western-directed dissidents.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants – more than one-fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
And in July, tens of thousands went to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
American Graduation Ball Culture Comes to University Life: First-Timers Offered to Arrive on a Private Plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the UK’s first “luxury” category travel service for current students.
To give a vivid impression of the university’s arrival, the company also offers transportation options such as a private jet, the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or the McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also said the service was thinking about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their stuff across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new options for VIF, we look forward to helping this year’s students get to the university with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
The company’s representative said that as this service has just been launched, orders have not yet been received, but added that “students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks.”
The company also said that despite the fact that students are required to pay <0xC2><0xA3>9000 per year for training, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and expectations: more important than ever, to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students criticized this service as detached from reality.
Megan Dann, NSS vice president of higher education, said: “This project seems incredibly detached from the lives of most students.
Many students who will start studying at the university this month are faced with a cost-of-living crisis when available financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to meet the rapidly growing costs of basic needs before they can even begin to think about it.
Feminists raise the issue of racial affiliation and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
The comers raise their hands, chanting, “Hands up, don’t shoot” as they wait in line in front of the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, linked to the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peres noticed a shift in an online conversation among white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminists who left comments put genders above racial affiliation when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Midwest grew and attracted national attention, Peres saw the responses of white women, who concentrated 100 per cent on racial belonging.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the August 9 murder, personal essays with headlines such as “The thoughts about Ferguson from the face of a white woman” and “Feminism is not just about the oppression of women” appeared relatively late.
But for Peres, they showed a significant shift.
“In feminism, I don’t think there are many people who talk about white skin color and privileges at such a high level,” she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis we have faced, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so tied to racial affiliation, they felt that this should be pointed out.
For a professor of English at the University of Ohio Corita Mitchell Ferguson revealed the problems that black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.
“I can write something funny on Facebook about what’s going on with me and my partner, and I’ll get 150 likes from everywhere,” Mitchell says.
When I write something about how colored people are attacked in their own country, the silence is deafening.
“Why is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships, but not about security in the public sphere?” she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied issues of race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between issues of race and gender.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly share these problems; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women are now pooling issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
“Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the reason for this was almost always the rape of a white woman,” Hatter said.
It took a white woman to confirm the story to justify the lynching.
From Hatter’s point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragists, for example, Susan B. Anthony studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for the right to vote would be effective only for one of the groups: women or men.
“They decided to put all the eggs in the basket of the women’s right to vote, and the black’s right to vote should have appeared later,” Hatter said.
Looking back on such things gives us a clear idea of why colored women don’t trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women achieved voting rights in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynchings in the Southern Women's Association for preventing lynchings.
The group emerged almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell’s point of view, the rise of white feminists’ reactions to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson – the behavior of the police, racial discrimination – reflects the time when white feminists had to “reach” the problems that black women did not deal with.
“Would it be great if activists who have such [traditional feminist] ideology were just as serious about the right to raise a child as they are about the right to contraception?” asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second wave, who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to understand what this means.
A well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, took advantage of Facebook and published a sharp article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans take more part in the protest.
“I hope that women who have another but similar reason to understand the danger in the body – and the views on racial issues that differ significantly in public polls – will be in the lead of change,” she wrote.
Although Steinem advocates for more cross-cutting feminism, which includes both racial and gender issues, her comments about race in America still amaze some.
American Entrepreneurial Institute researcher Christine Summers, author of “Who Stole Feminism?”, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, are “far more vulnerable than their sisters,” but the trailers Steyn’s about Fergusson’s counterattack.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small program, "Watch my brother" to help vulnerable black and Hispanic-speaking boys, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police’s relationship with the black community is not the only problem that is pushing the front line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. border service arrested about 63,000 underage people without escort on the country’s southwestern border this year, immigration reform once again surfaced – this time as a women’s problem.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present this issue as important to women, she only needed to share the stories of immigrant women.
“They speak for themselves,” Mercado said.
When the vast majority of workers’ visas are issued to [male immigrants], the women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories find the answer in women’s organizations,” she said.

The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric car market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will introduce to the government an integrated plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, told the deputy director of the ministry Oleg Pluzhnikov at the round table, which held "Vedomosti" at the Moscow Motor Show - 2014.
The plan is made at the request of the government, one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September - the beginning of October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures concerning electric cars and hybrids - the plan for the development of vehicles on gas engine fuel in Russia already exists.
The plan (copy has "Vedomosti") is planned for 2014-2017.
The criteria for the assessment of electric and hybrid transport will be developed and the decision will be made on how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
The report to the government, which will describe the tax and customs measures to support electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the scheme of preferential lending and preferential leasing will appear by April 2015; and the proposals to reduce the price of cars, stimulate localization and stimulate localization will be made in 2015.
In 2014-2015 it is planned to make changes to the regulatory and legal acts to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend in 2015 to formulate a proposal for regional authorities to also stimulate the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of providing it with advantages in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals for the expansion of the transport of goods.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will include in the list of indicators of evaluation of the activities of regional authorities the criteria reflecting the effectiveness of support for production of environmentally friendly transport, development of charging infrastructure.
The electric car market in Russia is only being formed – in 2013 around 100 electric cars were sold throughout the country.
At the beginning of 2014, the import tax on electric vehicles was abolished, so sales will be about 500 pieces, predicts the chief executive of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia Andrei Pankov.
But five-fold growth does not make electric cars any more noticeable: in 2013, according to the Association of European Business, 2.78 million light and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia.
So far, electric cars only import Mitsubishi Motors into Russia.
Renault is preparing to start importing - the company focuses primarily on corporate customers, says the Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships of Renault in Russia Nikola Remiz.
The majority of other manufacturers of electric transport have taken a stand-by position with regard to Russia.
The development of electric cars also has Russian manufacturers - ", GAZ, ", but the output is miserable.
For example, in January - July 2014, according to ASM-Holding, "AvtoVAZ" released 30 electric cars.
The demand is low due to the expensive car of electric cars, admits the director of "AutoVAZ" on engineering Sergey Amanov, without the support of the breakthrough in this segment will not be....
The development of the Russian market of electric cars in addition to the expensive cars (the electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average twice the cost of analogues with internal combustion engines) inhibits the development of the charging infrastructure (fuels - units).
Due to the expensive and low rates of lowering the cost of electric vehicles in the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, forecasts the editor-in-chief of "Author" Mikhail Podorozhansky, Celikov agrees with him.
Auto manufacturers, on the contrary, say that some models of electric cars are already close to the cost of ordinary.
The Russian electric car market has good prospects, the main thing is to add confidence to consumers that "electricity" is real; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of all new charging stations, emphasizes the President of the BMW Group in Russia Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, by the state-owned company "Rosseti": several stations are built in Moscow, soon there will be about 80 more.
Negotiations on the construction of the gas network are also being held with other regions.
According to the director of the department of "Rossets" Vladimir Sofiin, the company believes in the market of electric cars and is ready to build fuel stations all over the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric cars of different brands.
In addition, "Rosseti" as a network company do not have the right to sell electricity, the possibility to do this in relation to charging electric cars is being worked out.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the market of electric vehicles in Russia to be the abolition of customs duties.
The zero rate will be in effect until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension, expansion of the preferential list is being worked out.
Replacing the transport tax on environmental (the idea is discussed and applies to all machines) will also support the market, but not as sensitive as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
Transport tax in Russia is small, Pankov says, unlike, for example, Norway, where the tax reduction has led to a sharp increase in sales of electric cars - now they account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, incentives are also needed for car owners, such as free parking in the center of the city (as they have already done in Moscow), Pankov is confident, or the possibility of moving electric cars along the designated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado.
The single-engine Piper PA-46 crashed in the U.S. state of Colorado.
Three of the five people in it have died, reports ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometers from the runway of the Denver City Airport airport.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In the Donetsk region, they deal with the captured fighters of the battalion "Donbass".
The Tsars were surrounded by Ilovaisks.
They were handed over by their own commanders, and dozens of gunmen were killed in the shelling.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation in the south-east of Ukraine really was, they would not go to war.
There are 108 prisoners who can be called lucky.
The Tsars of the Donbass battalion remained alive after the "meat-hook", in which they fell under Ilovaisk.
In the vicinity of the army of the Donetsk People's Republic, the militants spent several days, in fact abandoned by their commanders and authorities of Ukraine.
When it was reported from the headquarters that the "ring" could be exited along the allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But just a few minutes later, shells and bullets were fired from all sides.
"Judging by the information I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave," said the deputy commander of the battalion, who had the nickname "Lermontov".
And when we came down between Mnogopol and Chervonoselski, there was a crossfire with anti-tank guided missiles, with "snacks", 30-millimeter grenade launchers, automatic BMD rifles, small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three cars behind, so there were only two cars left.
The officer with the caller "Lermontov" says: almost immediately at least 60 people were killed, dozens were wounded, many died already later.
Survivors are now being medically assisted by those they came to kill.
Now prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give food, drugs.
At the same time, their own commanders actually deceived them and betrayed them to the true death.
They just betrayed us, they say.
The column, the whole battalion, to be destroyed.
In the battalion "Donbass", like many of his comrades, Alexei became a volunteer, because in the Ukrainian news they told about atrocities that allegedly made in the south-east "separatists".
Alexey has already seen a completely different picture here.
His mother was killed in Luhansk - not someone, but Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that there is a mortar shelling going on, that it is most likely the Ukrainian armed forces," said one of the soldiers, Alexei.
After that, I wanted to leave the battalion.
We were not released from Ilovaisk, they said we were in the ring.
I've already agreed with the commander, I've already written the report on leaving.
Zurahovo and I were immediately lucky in Ilovaysk.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were trapped in the "cot" near Ilovaysk.
Now some of the survivors admit that if it were possible to turn the time back, they would not have entered the penal battalion for anything.
All the captured militias were handed over to the DPR’s forces.
Everyone will be checked for involvement in war crimes.

Twitter has become more interesting for new users.
Twitter’s microblogging service has changed the process of registering users to quickly engage new participants in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have lost their microblogs.
Now, new Twitter users will be browsing a large number of recommended accounts during the registration process to make up their reading circle immediately.
Recommendations are made on the basis of the interests indicated when registering.
At the same time, Twitter automatically installs a subscription link for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to manually remove the tiles, so as not to read those that he is not interested in.
If previously users of the microblogging service saw only avatars of recommended users, now Twitter takes a sample of one of the popular blogger tweets to help make an impression on the person.
This is the biggest change to the Twitter registration page in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been actively working on modernizing the service.
This activity is primarily related to the continued efforts of the service to achieve immortality.

The company is currently desperately in need of a greater number of loyal consumer resources, which, once again, would remain for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising.

The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release the game about modern journalism
Game designer Nicky Case, known for the game Coming Out Simulator, decided to release the game about modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact has been widely known only now.
The source of inspiration for the game was events in Ferguson, where protests are now underway, which began after a policeman killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has not yet been named, will be how informational coverage of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in areas where clashes are taking place between the police and the population.
The hero can take different pictures of what is happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the police will look like heroes, and the protestors are bandits, the police will start to treat him better and let him go where the ordinary person can’t go.
If he will cover events differently, his photos could turn peaceful protests into a large-scale rebellion.
Points in the game will need to be picked up with the help of the Twitter hero, in which will appear new subscribers, if the photos displayed there will turn out to be popular.
The game has no names yet.
The date of release and the platform on which it will appear is unknown.
Case, however, published an image demonstrating how an event could change depending on how a photograph was made and processed about it.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for quite a long time, but initially wanted to dedicate it not to protests in the United States, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he began collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to illuminate the history of the region.
However, when he saw media coverage of events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on what had happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who produces browser-based games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, which was released in 2014.
This game, which tells the story of Case’s own biography, is about how a bisexual teenager tries to tell his or her relationship to homophobic parents.
Ghelety attracts Ukraine in the continuation of bloodshed
The call to prepare for the next “tens of thousands” of victims of the Ukrainian Defense Minister Valery Gelety attracts the people in the continuation of the bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published on his Facebook page the above-mentioned post, is an object for the study of specialists not in the military field," - said in a message of Russian diplomats.

At the same time, he said that the “Operation for the Liberation of Eastern Ukraine” was completed.

It is necessary to formally admit that this is indeed so, but the mind and stomach remain inviolable.
After all, they have known for a long time: we say "Belgium" - we mean the media, we say "media" - we mean "Belgium".
Restaurants like to say in depth that the success of the establishment depends on three factors: location, location and once again location.
There are such places, located not to be good, but even excellent, but some uncaring.
In short, sitting behind the palm table, I remembered that once there was a cafe "City" (in honor of the same TV broadcast), then "Odesa-mama", and also the restaurant "Bojole" and the beer "Friendship".
Now here again beer, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
Above the ground there was only the top of the iceberg: a bar stand and a couple of tables, all the rest of the space was devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But here it is fun, as in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows - TVs, where the girls-rusals swim.
Belgian institutions in St. Petersburg have long been out of the blue, so there is something to compare with.
Here eight types of liquefied beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 liters) and an innumerable number of bottles (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive waitress is happy to present the menu, telling that "the media are full of big seeds", and it should be noted: it is the service, despite the individual shortcomings, - the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in terms of content, but often very unexpected in terms of performance.
Well, who, for example, is given to assume that meat roulette with Walloon black sand (280 rubles) - in fact, carpachcho, cut to the same so thin that the parchment paper in comparison with it will appear matter immoderately thick.
It is possible to feel at least some taste, only if you sin together half a plate.
Salads are even worse.
The classic Liege (260) would be the right thing to admit to a crime against the Belgian people: some kind of cheeky iceberg, a once-drained potato, a crisper Kenyan bean, veggie chips from bacon plus why-and-why.
You don't want to meet anyone with that ice cream salad!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If it was still possible to close your eyes to the immature quartets of cherry tomatoes or overheated champignons, then why does the media look as if in their lifetime they have managed to freeze and open them several times!
I already know: there are quite normal white sea meds here!
They are served in pots "in sauce of your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
The sauce of half a dozen, that of white wine, celery and carrots, did not honestly ask.
There are plants, and there is no smell, no matter if there was wine, it remains a mystery.
But good ones rely on the mediums of frita with homemade mayonnaise.
Chicken with water here is not bread, thick to the point that depending on the mood you can decide, the first or second dish in front of you, but just a nice sandwich.
It was stated that the rabbit local cook cooks in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about the rosemary.
At the top, the situation turned out to be diametrically opposite: the rosemary absorbed everything.
It seemed that this rabbit was fed exclusively with rosemary cysts during its life, which is why the meat acquired such an unusual aroma.
But at the same time, the rabbit was attached to the leg a wonderful - no, just a cancellation of the pears in a caramelized cocoon.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also saturated - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The clenbuterol sauce turned out to be an excess of hydrogen, and waffles were dried.
But the manager who came to the table was very informally interested in the lunch impressions.
So we should come again.
The price of the dollar rose on the IMFB above 37 rubles on the news of new sanctions against Russia being prepared by the West.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar calculated "tomorrow" at 10:29 MSK rose by 26.9 kopecks and amounted to 37.02 rubles, the euro rate rose by 30 kopecks - to 48.73 rubles, according to data of the Moscow Exchange.
The bi-currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached its maximum on February 19, 2009 - then it was 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is of a long-term nature, both in pairs with the euro and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term forecast suggested this mark, - says senior analyst "Alpari" Anna Bodrov.
Everything related to Ukraine, in one way or another, will be reflected in the courses.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumors about the invasion of troops have not been confirmed on either side, but the market has been very emotional.
All the conversations that he was resistant to such news were overblown yesterday.
The week, according to the forecasts of the specialist, will close near these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine - all these are links of a single chain.
Inflation is also forecasted: current prices for the fall will add from 5 to 10%.
Soon, in addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will end, and there will be some vacuum until the networks are refocused on other suppliers.
“Dollar came to the mark at 37 rubles, passed it and came back, there is no strong hysteria,” said Konstantin Bushuev, head of market analysis at the “Opening Broker” market.
They will still see if they will impose the promised sanctions on Saturday, as NATO will sit.
Ruble, according to him, sharply weakened after the end of the tax season, then went to the news about Ukraine, in addition, the Central Bank said last week that by the end of the year it is fully moving to the floating rate and is refusing any currency interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, it was no different from the previous ones during this month, it was all scared of the mark in 37 rubles, - continues the analyst.
And so, in terms of turnover, nothing powerful happened.
Worrying times for the foreign exchange market were, I will remind, when at the end of January there was an increased demand for currency, as well as the third March, when the Central Bank unloaded a record amount of currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, it is an increase in the revenue part of the budget from export operations, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers by increasing imports, says Alexey Kozlov, chief analyst at UFS IC.
Negative points can be attributed to the rise of imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, provoke the growth of inflationary pressure and, as a result, become the cause of the increase in the borrowing of money, which, in turn, hinders the development of the economy.
When it comes to the stock market, devaluation of the ruble somewhat smoothes down the prices of the shares expressed in the ruble.
For example, the MMVB Index fell by 1.67% during Thursday’s trading, and the RTS Index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative size of the index decline is due to the weakening of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is of an emotional nature and is explained by the mass desire to buy currency.
As practice shows, the emotions gradually go down, and the quotes of the ruble partially or completely restore lost positions.
“We hope that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar,” said Alexey Kozlov.
A genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed.
The British woman reported that she had spent many years thinking she would die after a misdiagnosis.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she had only a few years left to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Sharko-Marie-Touta disease (SMT) - a group of inherited disorders that lead to nerve damage outside the brain and spinal cord.
The charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with STDs because so little is known about this condition.
About 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have a PTSD, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, unconfident walking, and swollen toes.
Patients may feel numbness or pain, and the condition does not heal and progress, which means that the symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Frederick's ataxia (AF) - a condition for which the prognosis was very poor.
Rogers thought she would be tied to a wheelchair by the time she was 18 and die before she turned 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do what others did.
I fell every day, and I spent more time on everything.
I was never able to ride on roller skates or skateboards with other kids, and I needed a lot of fun at school because of how I was walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release the Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked at the medical card when her doctor came out of the room, and it was written that she had AF.
"I felt guilty because I pulled my nose where it shouldn't be, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I came home, found information about the condition in the library, and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and experienced the most terrible panic possible.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I turned 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in that interval.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she turned 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, “My dear, I don’t think you have this disease because you would have been in a wheelchair already.”
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic examinations, she was diagnosed with SMT.
“When he explained what the SMT was, I thought I pulled out a happy ticket,” she said.
The UK SMT charity has announced a month of information about SMT to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on entrepreneurs in the Washington area is growing as the economy recovers
The restorative economy means more customers, more sales, and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
Accounts for state and local tax payments for companies across the country increased moderately last year, when the recovery of the economy accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington area are no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to the state and local courts in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from the $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden on state and local businesses rose 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth since the next two years, when the accounts declined, in 2009 and 2010.
Taxes charged by the state grew faster, 4.3 percent than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by the firm providing professional services, Ernst & Young, and the State Tax Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county's tax revenues, 56 percent, are taxed on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of Maryland's tax revenues are on firms.
Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the smallest amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, tax revenue growth is driven by a return to the company’s previous level of real estate value, the researchers say it raised real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.
While most of these revenues are coming from large states, such as California, New York, and Texas, the same seems to be happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 — an increase of 4.2 percent, compared to the previous year.
However, the observed return of property value does not have any similar effect on the growth of tax revenues by the state and at the local level in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of the company’s tax bills.
Companies in Virginia and the District of Columbia pay about half of the tax bills by state and local level in the form of property taxes.
“What’s happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, belongs either to the government or to a non-profit organization that doesn’t pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive vice president of Real Estate.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that exist in other states.
The recent growth in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
The incomes of entrepreneurs also seem to be coming to a correction, according to this data.
Companies in the region declared corporate income tax at the state level of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion in corporate income tax revenues, most notably in the region.
Although trends are directed in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase at the same rate in all three localities.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the country average, 4.3 per cent, while the growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, there was an increase in tax revenues below the average, equal to 4.1 percent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax rate out of three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate), equal to 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the county it is relatively high - 9,975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia, taxes were lower for state and local entrepreneurs and, overall, a more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.
The district was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantages, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbor in the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law that lowered its corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, as well as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to achieve its tax revenue targets next year, this law could lead to a corporate income tax rate of up to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, a small business in the Washington area seems to feel better and thus pay more taxes on the state and local level, according to a recent study.
The taxes paid to entrepreneurs in the form of an individual income tax by small business owners - the transitional structure on which most small firms are set up - in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 per cent last year, by more than $2, per year.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in revenue from taxes on business across the country is likely to persist this year, with tax revenues from turnover in the state governments and at the local level rising by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period.
However, the Washington area may lag behind, as the decline in federal spending affects the labor market in the region.
Bronze Age of the Russian Judo
The home world judo championship brought two silver and seven bronze awards to the Russian national team.
According to this indicator, the Russians gave up only the main favorite of the competition - the team of Japan.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who performed in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in the equal final fight with Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation decided only one remark received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament became the most successful for the Russian team - on Tuesday, three medals were won immediately.
In men's competitions in the category up to 66 kg of silver was awarded to Mikhail Pulyaev, and bronze to Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian handed over the 2011 and 2013 world champion to the Japanese Massai Abinum.
Khan-Magomedov, who lost the compatriot in the quarter-final stage, won a comfortable tournament and became the owner of the bronze award.
In the women's tournament of the category up to 52 kg also up to the third stage of the pedestal, Natalia Kuzyutin got the respect.
In the semi-finals, she lost to the current world champion Milende Kelmendi from Kosovo, who competed in this championship under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title.
Kuzyutin won the bronze with Ma Inan from China, but after the end of the tournament she still admitted that third place is not what she expected.
And again, the obstacle on the way to the gold of the Russian was Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzyutin earlier in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk the bronze in the pit of the Russian national team put Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category up to 73 kg.
In the quarter-finals, his abuser was former representative of Moldova Viktor Skowortsov, who now speaks for the UAE team.
However, the Russian won two fights and became the owner of the prize.
Mogushkov has performed at the home championship with a knee-jerk injury, which he plans to treat in the near future, so he will take a break in the competitions.
As for the ex-Moldovanin Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal at this tournament.
Interestingly, another of his compatriots, who accepted UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko with bronze finished the performance in the category up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Cup also brought to the Russians one bronze, which in the category up to 81 kg was won by Ivan Nifontov.
In the heavy battle of the small final, he defeated the Frenchman Alan Schmidt by a remark from the opponent.
On Friday, three sets of prizes were played at once at the tournament, but the Russians traditionally limited one bronze in the men's tournament to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill Asksov, and the Russian national team was guaranteed this medal: his rival in the comfortable final was compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the rival Voprosov could not get on the tatami due to the injury.
The men's bronze was won by the hosts and on the sixth day of the competition - it was placed in the pit of the team by Renat Saydov, who played in the category over 100 kg.
In the comforting final, he won a clean victory over Brazilian David Mourinho.
Thus ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the world championships in team competitions were played.
Both Russian teams – both male and female – were one of the main contenders for the awards, but, as in individual competitions, representatives of the beautiful sex did not get to the medal.
And here the Russian judoists won the command silver.
In the decisive confrontation, they gave up the main favourites of the competition - the team of Japan in a tough fight with a score of 2-3.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after the clean victory of Han-Magomedov and the volleyball player - Denis Yartsev (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in heavier weight categories, Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) were unable to cope with their Japanese rivals.
The same scenario developed a bronze match in a women's tournament, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, gave up to the Japanese - 2-3.
At the team competitions in Chelyabinsk was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who after the end of the tournament congratulated the men's team with silver.
"The second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was evident that you could become champions," Putin said, whose words RIA "News" is quoted as saying.
To lose to the Japanese, to the chiefs of the judo - there is nothing shameful here.
But I'm sure you can have them and win.
The Russian national team at the home world championships performed much better than a year ago in competitions of the same level, held in Rio de Janeiro.
At the time, there were only three medals in the asset of the Russian team - one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isaev.
We are all, of course, big maxims.
Yes, I want gold medals.
But let’s remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is one of the eight strongest, he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
All the more in the form of sports like judo", - summed up the results of the tournament of the Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko, whose words are quoted by the press service of the championship.
The team of Japan is expected to become the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of different merits, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will be held in Astana next summer.

The Joan Rivers family hopes for the best.
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter has expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from the illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had a cardiac arrest at a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkshire Endoscope, sources say.
The doctors deliberately keep her under anesthesia and under strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “heavy”.
The response was broad, including numerous online support from such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
They can all be kings.
Royal Blood’s debut album is a new hope for British rock, bringing rock duos out of clubs straight to the stadiums.
The Royal Blood duet is on the stage all year, but already has an active nomination for the BBC music award, a warm-up tour at Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the New York concert by Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album of the same name just a few months before the release received 100,000 pre-orders, and the contract for its release is in the Warner Music major-label portfolio.
Considering the current crying situation in the music market, the situation is out of the way, because it is not about the new Lana Del Rey or another sweet-smelling representative of the "new R'n'B", but about the duet of bullies in the sight of the British, who were playing with that horn.
In general, the stakes on the first album due to all of the above circumstances were particularly high and have already been fully justified.
The duet did not hesitate to take on a name that before that could be drawn except the desperate hair metalists, and the blood of which kings flows, as they seem to have in their dwellings, is also understandable.
It is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the past level Led Zeppelin: like the big quartet, Royal Blood aims to squeeze the blood of the British rock, bringing it to a new height.
To make predictions about the success of this enterprise so far, perhaps, early, but something can already be claimed.
A dozen songs set in thirty minutes is not so much a demonstration of a phenomenal composer’s gift as a confident and powerful statement of intent.
Some of the merits of individual numbers, of course, can not be denied: for example, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by what is remembered not by a melodic line, but by a drum party.
Musicians jokingly say that this song is generally easier to sniff than to sniff.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the cover of the album "Better Strangers" with a Shakespeare quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at the party of heavy rock lovers, but when they are played in a row they merge into more or less homogeneous canvas.
And it’s not necessarily bad, even vice versa.
The strength of Royal Blood is that they do not claim the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney (they are more likely to be thrown into the successors of Mot<0xC3><0xB6>rhead), but have taken numerous rock duets out of the ghettos of indie clubs.
Their music, despite some variety, was created for the stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple of thousand people, apparently close to her.
The secret is partly in the clever use of the bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format invented at the beginning of the zeros The White Stripes.
However, it is not only in the instruments, but also in the very approach to the writing of songs.
The heroes of the retrorock of zeros with great difficulty were chosen beyond the postmodernist paradigm, with a huge uneasiness they went on to recognize themselves not only as epigones, but as independent creative units.
Royal Blood already sounds so powerful and sharp that this effort successfully drops some of the secondary and solidity of the musical material.
After all, who said that rock should be smart?
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: The online store – and video producer, and hundreds of other things – is buying Twitch’s streaming video playback service for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
This news came as a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Google’s Twitch video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and such a combination looked natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a streaming service of a general nature – a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform where gamers broadcast their in-game moments; “YouTube for real-time games,” according to Business Insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videos, in which omniscient give (mainly old) games processing, as in "Theatre Mystery", are already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch has been met with no particular interest, a classic example of a entrenched tech company buying back a potential competitor.
It’s a secret why the deal with YouTube failed, given that it was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Shir: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster.”
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me, who claim to be better at sports than watching it, find it hard to understand the attraction of watching games instead of taking the joysticks into their own hands.
It’s one thing to look through a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. when she stumbles through Resident Evil, and it’s quite another thing to watch a stranger get 20 shots in the head in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them without controlling the angle of view on your own can be a recipe for headache worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the fast-paced passages in which the Rogers Bennisters of our electronic age complete whole games in record time are amusing.
But if it’s not about game virtuosity or humor, it’s unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, and it is the fourth-largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How will Amazon do that?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch will turn to Amazon Instant Video just as beautifully as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would be happy to receive: crowds of young men who are dreamt of by advertisers.
As the head of Twitch Shir, Amazon and Twitch said “both believe in the future of games”, and this channel does not give signs of seduction, even – he – as a spectacular sport.
As a result of the 2004 attack, more than 330 people died, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked with the surviving hostages - almost all the students, with the parents of the deceased, with the guardian of the cemetery - City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, head of the committee "Mother Beslan" Susan Dudieva, who took part in the special operation "Ovrovszt "Esponica" - Razkaspora employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs
Having already returned to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was an adviser to the President on the Northern Caucasus and conducted negotiations with the terrorists, as well as with the officer of the management “B” of the FSB of Russia Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What struck me especially during my work on this topic is that in Beslan it was as if there had been no such thing for ten years.
This topic is extremely painful for anyone who has anything to do with it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions of the trip are very difficult.
But we can’t forget Beslan, and I hope we managed to do our job,” Antonova said.
The special project is prepared by the Rambler & Co holding company’s infographics studio, which has been operating at the company since spring this year.
The previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s stay in power.
DPRK Launches Small-Range Missile
North Korea has launched a small-range missile into the waters of the Sea of Japan, Renhap reported.
The launch was carried out around 10.30 a.m. local time by the province of Chagando, located on the border of North Korea and China.
Presumably, the missile fell into the Sea of Japan, flying about 220 km, said in the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea.
MPs proposed to speed up the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
In case of success of the initiative, the data of Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from 1 January 2015
The State Duma introduced a draft law providing for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is placed in the basis of legislative activity of the lower house.
Its authors were the deputies of the State Duma Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov ("United Russia"), Vladimir Parachin ("Justice Russia") and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
Such a change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to a more efficient and effective guarantee of the rights of the citizens of the Russian Federation to the preservation of personal data and compliance with the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks.
The law, the entry into force of which is hastened by parliamentarians, obliges to store in the territory of the Russian Federation personal data of Russians processed via the Internet.
It also makes mandatory the recording, systematization, storage, storage, clarification and extraction of personal data of Russian citizens, in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as the indication of the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right on the basis of the court’s decision to restrict access to information processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called “blacklists” of infringers’ websites – an automated information system “The Register of Violators of the Rights of Personal Data Subjects”.
This law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugovoi and Vadim Dengin from LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from KPRF.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill on the transfer of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in Russia will have to pay for the rent
Commenting on the draft law submitted to the State Duma today, Leonid Levin, the first deputy head of the Duma Information Policy Committee, said he did not see any problems with the transfer of the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own storage of Russian personal data on the territory of the Russian Federation will be able to rent them, for example, in "Rostelekoma", which repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rent, the Group will be able to rent out the company, and will be able to sell them.
“In addition, there are several independent data centers that are ready to cooperate in this area,” he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work in the territory of the Russian Federation, I see no problems - they will get technological opportunities for placement," Levin said.
Controversial bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications feared that in the event of the adoption of the bill, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, it is about the services of online booking of airline tickets and hotels.
According to the association, "the bill deprives the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation the right to dispose of their own data imperatively by determining that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation."
The RAEC statement underlines that a more effective measure would be to establish a mechanism for informing the user of where the recording is taking place, and to systematize his personal data.
In this case, you will be able to choose in which territory these actions will be carried out.
The adoption of similar bills on the “localization” of personal data in other countries has led to the abandonment of global services and significant economic losses.
Participant of test with a bucket of ice water exuded the jaw
Isabelle Roberts from the UK cried so much when ice water poured into her head that it damaged the bone structure of her face.
This test with a bucket of ice water went to the pain wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed so loudly during the test with a bucket of ice water that her jaw erupted.
Isabelle Roberts cried so bitterly when ice water poured into her head that it damaged the structure of her face.
“The water was so cold that I screamed, but when I did, my jaw started to freeze,” she told The Mirror.
Water for a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts in seconds before the accident.
I tried to close my mouth, but it didn't close, it stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister came to the same understanding and they started to hooch, but I had to urgently go to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old woman from the UK was taken to the hospital to straighten her jaw after participating in a popular fascination on Tuesday.
The video became an internet sensation and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The militias handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
In the “Army of Novorossiysk” they claim to have shot down the Ukrainian Su-27, and accuse the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement.
As of 10:00 on September 1, the militias handed over to the Ukrainian side 402 prisoners, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to Interfax, a representative of the press service of the Novorossiysk Army.
He added that “by air defense forces in the area of the Mereshka settlement will shoot down a Su-27 plane that violated the ceasefire agreement.”
According to the agency’s interlocutor, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions banned by international conventions during the Luhansk airport artillery shelling.
A spokesman for the press service noted that the militias were able to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian Air Force at one of the field airfields overnight, as well as destroy two armored personnel carriers and two warehouses with ammunition.
"Deaths in the enemy's living force - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, 13 people were taken captive," the staff representative summed up.
"Interfax" does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, armed formations of the "people's republics" of Donbass announced the transfer to the Ukrainian side as part of compliance with the ceasefire regime of 223 captured soldiers and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, at night, the army of the DPR, according to the "Army of Novorossiysk", "interrupted attempts by the Nazi guards in violation of previously reached agreements to remove heavy equipment from the surrounding area."
Then the militias reported the destruction in the short-term battle of two tanks and two BMPs, the capture of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 soldiers.
According to the staff, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol) during that night amounted to five tanks, eight armored fighting vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers were surrounded by militias in the Ilovaisk area of the Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked the leadership of the “people’s republics” to release Ukrainian military personnel from the environment.
In the DPR they agreed to do so on condition of surrender of weapons and ammunition by the enemy.
The first dozens of soldiers began to leave the surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense "Donbass" Semenchenko, on the night of Sunday, another 14 people came out of the "cat".
In his Facebook post, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded are “in captivity at 137 regiments of 32 divisions of the Russian Federation and 9 tank brigades of the Russian Federation”, where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Defense of Russia have denied reports by Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take retaliatory measures in case of EU introduction of new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take countermeasures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry reports.
The Russian Foreign Ministry’s statement said that the European Council’s “conclusions” of August 30 demonstrated the inability of EU member states to overcome the inertia of their unobtrusive support of the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, relying on "absolutely unproven allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of this country," the ministry said on its website.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, despite the interests of its member states, is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in intensifying the confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full “dialogue between the opposing parties”, the ministry stressed.
On the website of the ministry, it is noted that there are currently no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbas, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has unfolded, as well as the number of victims among the peaceful population is increasing.
It should be recalled that during the next seven days in the European Union it is planned to develop specific proposals on sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, EU representatives work closely with U.S. officials.
It is assumed that they will correlate with each other the measures to be introduced in terms of the period of action and the degree of rigidity.
The new EU sanctions could affect the energy and financial sector.
The Australian government has also announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the fields of defence, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Ways to save money on university textbooks <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1000 per year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to a second course, has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system of how to take books for rent from high school students, offering them nominal compensation to delay their sale.
“My math textbook, which usually costs $180, I got for a semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A cookie,” says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The required literature for the previous semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and teaching supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas similar to the Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der system.
Book rental is becoming more and more popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and is often much cheaper than buying it.
The company "Nibo Incorporative", which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of book rental has doubled since 2011.
Research in the industry shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores during the last spring semester have been rented out, says Nibo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the professional association "National Association of University Stores".
Here is an introductory course on the best ways to make a profitable transaction.
Shopping in an online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one-third of what you’ll see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostettler costs about $290 per reader, but the new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.
The purchase of a holding
If you’re not against other people’s marks or damage, held textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in stock at Chegg.com.
Matt Cassadey, 25, a fourth-grade student at Brigham Young University, says he paid Amazon.com 42 cents for a hand-held copy of the book “Strategic Solutions to the Media: Understanding the Business Side of Advertising Business.”
The book sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Breesy, director of the College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts at Emherst, offers students to clarify with their professors whether previous editions can be used.
Sometimes the upgrades are not essential for classes.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small share of the value of the last edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying books.
Rent-a-car
To take the rental textbooks, it is worth thinking, if you will be good enough to deal with them, do not forget to return them and do not want to leave them to yourself after the course is completed.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent a "Mathematical Analysis" for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take books, including any fines you may incur for marks, underscores, and damages.
If you take a book for rent, remember: if you don’t return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books actually take on a lease by acquiring an electronic license for a certain period from distributors, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Renting a "Mathematical Analysis" on Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.
Breesy says that students studying literature can often find the most advantageous prices, as many classic works can now be downloaded for free, while literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.
Whatever it is, check it out.
Joe Gold, 29, who is going to start studying at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to find out the price of the book, as it ensures that you are looking for the text you need.
Before you place an order on the Internet, Holt says, be sure to check if the book is actually in stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he purchased was delayed by four weeks, and eventually he paid a full price at the university bookstore.
Putin has declared complete inefficiency of the Far East Development Fund
Russian President Vladimir Putin revealed at a meeting on state support of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reported.
“15 billion rubles remained on the deposits,” the president stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State instructed to speed up the approval of the list of pre-development territories in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of the TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the President noted, did not confirm until July 1 the list of the territories of pre-eminent development in the Far East, and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main tasks for the development of the Far East.
Among them, the increase in transport accessibility of the region, the lifting of infrastructure restrictions - both in the domestic market and for export development.
In addition, it is necessary to create prerequisites for attracting additional investments to the region, as well as to form areas of pre-development that should be competitive with key business centers of the ATR, the President stressed.
Recall, it was previously reported that the territory of pre-development can replace the OEZ.
Why the "Guardians of the Galaxy" could not save cash fees
The “Unstoppable 3” Silverstar Stallone returned less than $30 million from his $90 million budget in the U.S., while the “City of Sins: The Woman Worth Killing” returned only $12 million from his $70 million budget.
“Home video” with Cameron Diaz brought only $14.6 million in the first weekend, while children’s films such as “How to Train a Dragon 2” also disappoint with revenue.
The Telegraph's article, Robbie Collins, points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be a case of poor quality films themselves.
Collins called 2014 the “worst” year in history in terms of children’s films, and called “How to Train a Dragon 2” a barely “functional” continuation of fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at an audience of a slightly older age, it seems that the problem does not necessarily consist of films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings of each film released in the summer in the amount of at least 2,000 copies between May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinions of both filmmakers and film critics, suggest that the harvest of this year’s films is similar in caliber to last year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that the case may be in changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of streaming internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favro, who is currently working on the upcoming Disney film Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter: “I think times are changing.”
We must acknowledge this and not try to strive for what was before.
In contrast to the current fall in cash charges in Hollywood, Netflix’s revenue from the streaming service has reached $1.2 billion, almost twice as high as last year’s $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for overly relying on comic book franchises, and predicted Hollywood's "crime."
In light of the current decline, some commentators argue that his dark predictions had a share of the truth.
Due to the fact that in the summer of 2015 several potential box office hits are expected to come out, including "Avengers: Era Altron", "Minyonov" and "Yursky Park", other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
Producer Simon Kinberg recently called the fall of cash collections simply “cyclical,” saying Hollywood Reporter: “The next summer will be the most cashier summer in history, and no one will worry about it.”
Product sanctions do not scare the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Middle Asian food, but for restaurants of European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
And in general, the general question as yet prefers to replace the banned imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
“It’s better to have a little cucumber than a bad mozzarella,” says Italian restaurant chef Barlotti Mariano Valerio about the quality of cheeses offered to him by suppliers in exchange for Italian ones.
Mozzarella and burrata cheese finished in the restaurant first, they have a small shelf life.
Parmesan stock should be enough for a couple of months.
What to do?
Moving on to Russian?
In 2005, I was in the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it’s clear: shocking memories don’t let go of him until now.
The meat there was lying on the trolleys just 30 centimeters from the floor!
There's cats!
Crying!
Then I said that for our restaurant we will never buy anything in the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's all changed there now.
But the other day I got a fish sample from the Far East.
That's how she turned out!
I said I don't even want to talk to the person who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many ordinary things for Italy for the Russian producer in the wild.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, hang the meat in the refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It should hang up to become soft so that the muscles relax.
I did it all with the local beef.
Then I was asked, "Where did you get such sweet meat?"
I said, 'That's yours, Russian!'
Why don't you guys do that?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" hangs a stop-list in the kitchen, which lists missing products: French oysters, seafood.
The chef of the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" and the bar "Strelka" Directed by Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already replaced with slices from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
However, and Regis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: “The color cabbage is 200 rubles!
I ask, "Why, on what basis does it cost so much?"
They say, “We have to make money, too.”
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
We buy Far Eastern oysters by weight, but they live 15-20 years, you know, how much does their pancreas weigh?
At the price it turns out that it is superdelicates.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of scarecrows for foreign dishes.
The standard story: “The first three months were all good, then the quality fell sharply.”
The main claims: Russian suppliers can not withstand stable caliber and quality.
Many restaurants in European cuisine do not know what will happen to them when the cheese stocks end

The Sanctions Menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are called mainly food sanctions.
It is forbidden to import beef, pork, meat and poultry by-products, meat delicacy, fish, molluscs, milk, yogurts, manure, cheeses, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups into the country.
Restaurants started a chechard with suppliers: the prices of products have increased, it is necessary to urgently look for analogues from other countries.
The strongest of these will be the expensive restaurants with monocoques from France, Italy, Spain, in which the products were delivered directly from the "mother" countries.
The building had to be rebuilt before.
For example, in early 2014, Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier – American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers have ordered supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the summer-2014 sanctions turned out to be much more serious.
However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which result from the ban on Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for poop.
Italian Valerio hopes that the sanctions can still be eased.
In the meantime, some of the restaurants exist in conditions of uncertainty.
According to the company "East-West", one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
"Dear restaurants will have to change the menu under what are produced by local farmers and other countries," says Sergey Mironov, restaurant, owner of the agency "Restconsult".
If the chef is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such dishes, and the development of a new menu can take two to three months.
Trigel from the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" is ready for this: you will have to give up 10-15% of the dishes, another half menu - to rework.
Restaurants with a mixed kitchen are already starting to replace dishes, such as a steak made of marble beef - on befstrogans, says Sergey Mironov.
"The cheeses from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of the East-West company, said in a statement.
Milk and milk products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
U.S. chicken can be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and salmon from Norway - salmon, salmon, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget network restaurants will be easier to rebuild than the premium segment: it is unlikely that there were gourmets able to distinguish the Italian mozzarella from the Russian one.
Although it is difficult to get to Ginza Project, he believes.
Ginza Project has dozens of restaurants under different brands and with its own menu.
A lot of time will go by in return,” Mironov says.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the lack of owners in the country.
The owners of cafes of Caucasian and Middle Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more aromatic than European ones
But there are plenty of restaurants whose sanctions are virtually untouched.
These include establishments from the kitchens of CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
“There are no expensive products in Georgian cuisine,” says Hatuna Kolbaya, the owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the cafe “Wai mee!”
All the cheeses for us are made in Russia, the basis of many dishes - chicken fillet, exotic greens we do not use."
In the establishments of Kolbai, they have not yet removed any food from the menu.
Timur Lansky, owner of restaurants "Chayhon N1" with Uzbek cuisine, the sanctions also do not bother: he will only have to change the lamb to New Zealand.
"If Russia arranges imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in the price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe," he said.
From the CIS it is cheaper to get cut, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits.
At the same time, what they bring from Central Asia is much better than “plastics” from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
About Uzbek tomatoes, everyone knows that they are tasty, sweet.
No one says that about the Spanish.
After the imposition of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan Olimboy Artykov said that he plans to increase the export of fruit and vegetables to Russia twice by 2016.
About its intention to replace European imports into Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions, Belarus and Kazakhstan said.
Fast food restaurants, which responded to the “Money” request, are also quite calmly responding to the sanctions.
The McDonald’s press service said the localization exceeds 85% and the network operates with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of the department for working with suppliers of Subway Russia, about 80% of the products the network buys in Russia, although temporary difficulties can arise with the supply of vegetables and the increase in the prices of meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In Teremke, “sanctional products” generally occupied no more than 4%.
They didn't touch the sanctions and the noxious Walker.
KFC, Burger King, and Potato Chip didn’t respond to Money’s request, but other market participants claim that Burger King’s localization rate is significantly lower than McDonald’s.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are willing to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far East restaurants.
On your throat.
Meanwhile, restaurants complain that because of the increase in demand, prices are rising even on local products.
"The prices for Grabley products increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio - twice", - says restauranter Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of food will increase by 5-10%, Kolbaya admits.
The "East-West" does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have increased by 10-15% since the beginning of August."
“Brazilian suppliers have raised pork prices almost twice,” said Sergey Cancer, deputy CEO of Stardogs.
Chickens have grown by 35%.
We're waiting for prices from China, maybe they'll catch hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned price increase of 8%.
“It’s very difficult to raise prices now,” says Cancer.
According to statistics, the overall revenue growth for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8%.
This is the smallest number since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is not clear how quickly: as long as most restaurants have stocked up on products for the next two months in the hope of waiting for buybacks.
But what will happen in two months, no one knows.
On the square in front of the city hall of Moscow stands a dozen tents, decorated with greenery and wood.
In the center of the stage, musicians play the waltz.
This is a festival of regional products with the funny name "There's time to eat".
“We were going to celebrate local food for a long time, and here once the sanctions, we got bored, organized the festival,” says one of the organizers.
Behind the scene with Greek musicians, Anastas cooks salad from pasta and homemade sweets, on the days there was a master class to prepare a broth with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products are assured by the organizers.
In the tents - an exhibition of achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, celery from Salehard, vegetables from the sub-Moscow "Sovhoza name Lenin", cheese from the spoiled Italian Jay Klaus.
“The salmon for restaurants can be safely replaced by another salmon fish from the Far East,” says Philip Galkin, owner of the fish farm “Your People.”
We're hunting a deer, a kite, a sledgehammer, a sledgehammer, a royal salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon, because it's a wild fish.
The Norwegian salmon is also aquaculture.
You hold him in your hands, he won't even move.
And don't hold our Far East salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian mozzarella with the domestic mozzarella
In the window of his tent lie the beds with the beard "Magadan", a fever, an owl, a muxun, a midi from the Crimea, a ridge from the Far East.
Galkin is convinced that it is time to move on to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, fishing in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 - about 800,000 tons.
Lavka “Your People” has been working since 2012, selling fish through an online store, before the imposition of sanctions served another half a dozen restaurants, such as “Frequent Things”.
There are now 15 more restaurants in Galkin.
The same sushi can be made from our fish, he says.
We got bored and tried different recipes.
Now sushi is sold through the online store for a million rubles per month.
Our fish is cheaper in several times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
At the confirmation in Galkin's tent, I'm being cooked a portion of "Philadelphia" with a keto.
Unlike the rolls with the salmon, they have to chew longer, but the awareness that this fish, our domestic, gives strength.
On the site of the “Your People” drawer there are even rollers made of a coat and sea cove.
In sushi bars, it is true, replacing Norwegian salmon prefers Chilean.
Galkin explains this by telling the cows to come up with new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
“The Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us,” explains the owner of the Killfish Bar Dmitry Evseyev.
About the same situation with other products: Russian producers could occupy the liberated niche, but this is not the case.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project Boris Akimov, it is now possible to talk about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations, which have powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace the banned imports as opposed to our farmers.
That is, large producers from other countries will win from the ban in the first place,” says Akimov.
However, in the past month, the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
According to the results of the Rospotrebnadzor mass inspections, the activities of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
“We are studying the essence of the claims made to determine the actions needed to quickly open restaurants to visitors,” the company said in a statement.
In fact, no one knows what will happen next.
If everything is limited by food sanctions, this is one option that you can survive, - says on the condition of anonymity of a company employee engaged in restaurant consulting.
If McDonald’s starts shutting down all over the country, the scenario will be completely different.
"Europrotocol" instead of the GIBDD reference
Cash payments can be received without reference to GIBDD - so the Central Bank intends to encourage the introduction of "Europrotocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft of instructions, according to which from September 1 of this year, an insured motorist will be able to do without reference to the GIBDD.
This is true, however, only in cases where the accident was carried out under the "Europrotocol" without the participation of the road police.
That is, if only two cars were involved in the accident, there were no physically injured persons, the damage did not exceed the established limit and both drivers agreed on who was responsible for the accident.
From August 2, the payment limit under the "Europrotocol" is 50 thousand rubles, and from October 1 in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions it will be increased to 400 thousand rubles.
The fact is that often even in the event of minor damage, in a situation where the PPE can be drawn up under the "Europrotocol", drivers who are in an accident cause the PPE.
After all, in the presence of a police helmet, it was not possible to get compensation for it without a reference to the GIBDD.
The parameters set out in the draft guidelines are intended to eliminate this obstacle on the way to the implementation of the “Europrotocol” in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payout per helmet in connection with the DTP, drawn up without GIBDD employees, should not be lower than the limit under the "Europrotocol".
But at the same time, it cannot be higher than the limit specified in the helmet insurance contract.
The idea, of course, is useful and theoretically able to unload both the employees of the DPS and the roads.
But, most likely, it will not surprise either the motorists or the insurers.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new rules for cash payments.
As for the drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
In most cases, the driver will wait for hours for the inspector to arrange a small accident, because it is so more reliable.
And it is not yet known what will be easier - to defeat fraudsters or convince drivers of the reliability of the "Europrotocol".
Saving certificate will make it nameless and unresponsive
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban savings certificates on the presenter, but will allow the banks to make them an analogue of the irrevocable contribution.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will ban savings certificates for the presenter.
Recently, this tool has gained popularity, as rates here are higher than for bank deposits.
The fact is that the savings certificates for the depositors do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper to the bank, as there is no need to make deductions to the Fund of the Deposit Insurance Agency (ASA).
The pique of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, and are affected by it by Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to ASV estimates, control 98% of the profile market.
And the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the estimates of the agency, is about 3.5%.
The problem, explained in the ASV, is that customers of a small bank who bought such a certificate, in case of revocation of his licenses try to get money in the ASV.
Some depositors, who do not have sufficient financial literacy and who purchase savings certificates on the depositor, may assume that their investments are insured.
A well-founded lack of insurance payments on these certificates in case of revocation of a license from a bank can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In practice, there have been cases where the holders of the presentation certificates tried to recover insurance compensation through the court”, – stated in the ASV.
The problem, of course, is thoughtful.
After all, no one will pay the buyers of the certificates anyway, because they are legally not entitled to compensation from the state.
If it were to be that the instrument is not insured in the ASV, it would be prohibited along with it the metal accounts, on which the funds of citizens are counted in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but for their existence no one is trying.
The thing, most likely, is that the certificates on the presenter are very convenient securities, which can actually act as quasi-money.
At the same time, their movement is virtually out of control: any customer of the bank can buy a certificate, hand over it to any citizen, and before the receipt of such certificate can change many owners.
It is not by chance that the bill stipulates that a savings certificate must be a security that must be kept in the depositary.
And to sweeten the pill to the banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right to early repayment.
That is, an analogue of the irrevocable contribution, which bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: The First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend, protests were held by those who spoke out against the NATO summit in Newport.

Germany to send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter militants from the Islamic State terrorist group, reports ITAR-TASS on August 31, citing a decision taken following a meeting of the German government’s representatives headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reportedly sending to Iraq 30 portable anti-tank missile complexes "Milan" and 500 charges to them, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
Deliveries will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will speak in the Bundestag with a government statement on the subject.
Until now, Germany has not delivered its weapons to the "hot spots".
The views of the people of Germany on the sending of weapons to the Iraqis were shared.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop fighters from the Islamic State, while others fear that this weapon may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov was attacked by militias
The Donetsk militias raided the Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reports ITAR-TASS on August 31.
According to available data, this occurred in the Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shirokino and Beznamene (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reported the shelling of two coast guard boats.
It is reported that the incident occurred today around 16:20 MSK.
Teenagers taken on a helicopter from the Blue Mountains
Two teenage bushwalkers were taken on a helicopter to a safe place after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old young man set off for a hike shortly after noon on Sunday at Govetts Lip in Blackhat.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team was dispatched, which included local police and rescue teams, and the couple were found around 11 p.m. near the Bridal Valley waterfall.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell and shook his head.
The officers stayed with the couple for the night, and were picked up on the swan on Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance in a stable condition to Blue Mountainz Hospital.
There were two unions.
The negotiations at the top level in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first faces of the European Union met with the first faces of the Eurasian future
Even on an alarming point (the situation around Ukraine is not tolerated by the sanctions), EU and Customs Union leaders discussed a number of “hot problems” for the first time.
Whether such a structure is capable of functioning effectively is unclear; but it is clear who removed the meltdowns from this summit.
Questions on this account fell away on the evening of August 26, when Belarusians, and after them and other Eurasians with Europeans saw in the TV news of the new President Lukashenko.
The Belarusian leader has been an example of degenerate politeness, it was the behavior of a person who has just broken the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in the higher society.
How Maidan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk immediately of the three main European Commissioners (EU ministers), who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf - not just the legitimacy of the president with a 20-year internship.
This is an application for recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European policy and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Denis Melyantsov, senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Research, is confident that from now on Brussels will no longer be able to speak to Minsk in the same tone as before.
“The fact that Catherine Ashton met a tete-a-tete with Lukashenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to freeze,” he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparation for the breakthrough of Belarusian authorities began long before the November Maidan in Kiev - the summer of 2013.
"The results have been achieved with the EU - these are successful negotiations on simplification of visa regime and readmission, dialogues on modernization, - lists the interlocutor "Fire", - and negotiations on international security were held with the US.
The U.S. has even lifted some sanctions.
As far as Ukrainian events are concerned, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them has only undermined this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize Crimea’s accession to Russia and called for punishing pro-Russian militias in the Donbass with all severity, did not argue with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave the Customs Union or the CSTO, and the Russian air base is located in Baranovich.
Brussels and Washington noted Minsk’s balanced position on the Ukrainian issue – and appreciated it, Belarusian experts are sure.
How successful Lukashenko’s move to political diversification will be, will be visible on how often in the near future Minsk will have to accept meetings in the EU+TS format.
In the press service of the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to promptly answer questions about what Brussels expects from relations in the new format.
The press secretary of Ashton Maya Kosyan<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> only stated "Fire" that, in the context of the resolution of the issues of war and peace, this issue is not a priority.
At the same time, there were reports that Kazakhstan could become the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
The drop of a finger for Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he, it turns out, personally asked the representatives of the European Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: all sides do not mind that Minsk remains the central venue for meetings both in the format of Russia -- OSCE -- Ukraine, as well as at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” is given the status of a fully-armed European leader who helps solve the global problem.
The best friend of a European farmer
Already the composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, pushed to the conclusion: the main underpinning of the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbas, but the economy.
In fact, the schedule of future negotiations on gas supplies and on overcoming the concerns of the countries of the CIS on the agreement on the association of Ukraine with the EU seems to be a more comprehensive achievement than the peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Karl De Gucht, however, said EU representatives “came to Minsk to look for a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, not the other way around.”
It seems, however, that even in the economy, the crisis in Ukraine “works” on Belarus.
Its consequences - and first of all, the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which has so far experienced the sanction pressure, the long-awaited field for maneuver.
According to the head of the Mizez Research Center, an ex-candidate to the presidents of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the opportunities of Belarus to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation in circumvention of sanctions.
At the same time, the delivery schemes for which Vladimir Putin hastened Minsk at the summit are presented.
"The initiators of these schemes," said Romanchuk "Fire", "are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out schemes for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.
The Russian business urgently needs to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second plot, the expert continues, is related to the fact that many Ukrainian companies will not only arrange production in Belarus of Ukrainian raw materials also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes can now prove to be very much in demand.”
According to Romanchuk, the role of the site owner for EU and CS negotiations is ideal for Lukashenko and in terms of economic relations with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow’s sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has currently offered agrarians only 125 million euros in compensation.
The Belarusian president may propose to Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for Eurofarmers.
This could raise Lukashenko’s authority in the EU to unprecedented heights.
Hospitality without initiative <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the format of the CS+EU is being resurrected, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with a Ukrainian colleague stressed that the initiator of the new format has become Kiev.
"It was your proposal to gather, without any hesitation to discuss, not from the bay-barachta to make a decision, after the signing of the Treaty of Association with the EU, to understand the situation that was at that time in Ukraine," he said in front of the cameras to Petro Poroshenko.
However, the observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, she was reportedly initially against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic office carefully emphasizes that Belarus, when organizing EU-TS cooperation on its land, does not pursue useful goals, and the ultimate goal of such a format is the creation in the future of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that in other spheres, in particular in the field of security, are pushing forward and promoting the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation," - said "Fire" in the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, the ministry, where the recent collapse has occurred.
Areas with paid entry may appear in Moscow.
The Moscow government considers the option of introducing paid entry zones as a method of combating congestion of central roads by analogy with other major cities of the world, reports M24.ru with reference to Moscow’s memorandum on transport issues Maxim Lyksutov.
One of the options that has successfully proven itself is a paid entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, look at all the disadvantages and advantages.
To say that some decisions have been made on this issue, as early as possible," Liksutov said.
Zimmera stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and loading, is very important to the authorities of the capital.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the already implemented construction of the central ring highway, Liksutov added.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to pass all traffic through Moscow.
If there were enough traffic infrastructure, then there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow,” the mayor said.
Also, Maxim Liksutov said that the introduction of paid parking lots significantly unloaded the streets of the capital.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop at what has been achieved.
On August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital Sergey Sobyanin participated in the ceremony of the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (TCAD).
The Mistake
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, "The City of Sins-2: The Woman for Whom It's Worth Killing" has not been the revolution that could have been expected of him.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), shot with the minimal but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary fiction.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental chain for modern thinking "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if to understand the universe of nuar under the thesis, and the cosmos of comics under the antithesis).
From now on it should be read: "Thesis - antithesis - chaos".
"The City of Sins-2" is chaotic on both the dramaturgic and philosophical levels: both times it is chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar with the first "City", although, behold, the roaring Marv (Mickey Rourke), remembers, ended his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, only manages to extract - in the role of this folk mate - from the air of knives and other cannon.
But the old men are literally shoved by the elbows of the newcomer, as if they had broken into the city from some other film, about the meaning and plot of which the viewers are asked not to worry.
So, his story, shamelessly challenged by the authors in the most interesting place, has super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Hers is with the greedy and frigid Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for something vengeful to her Dwight (Joss Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight, let’s say, does not distinguish in person from Johnny – especially since faces, like other parts of the body, characters are dealt with with inexorable regularity – is not trouble and not even half-defeat.
These are not people, we understand that these are the archetypes of nuar: a rock bitch, a player too confident in himself, who caught in the "bear trap" of sex detective, a corrupt hard-core senator.
Well, when an archetype waltzes with an archetype and an archetype chases away, it is no longer a movie, but an abstract painting.
And to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is just ridiculous.
In addition, there is something constant even in this Sumatran world.
The fighting holes from the first "City" still hold a circular defense against the invading native squabbles of dark forces.
Yeah, and Detective Hartigan's ghost doesn't, and he looks at the fire, and Bruce Willis is always nice to look at.
The main problem of "City of Sins-2" is in another.
Frank Miller was good at how the cartoonist talentedly connected the comics and the noir, and as a director he turned the idea of how to transfer the comics to the screen.
Comics and noir are two aggressively opposite "realitys".
The phenomenon of comics in modern form was born in the late 1920s, when the novels of Dashil Hammett "Bloody Sweat" (1929), "Maltese Sokol" (1930) and "Glass Key" (1931) created a canon of nuara, named after the school "hard-ilebo".
Or pulp fiction.
The comics have given Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from the seafarer Poppy, the spinner who gives him the power of fortune, Superman, Batman, and the scissors Dick Tracy to Halka, Thora, Spider-Man, and other "victims".
But in any movie based on the motives of the comics there was something harmful: the cartoon characters were stubbornly unwilling to turn on the screen flesh, they remained disguised in the surrounding "real" world of their will-unwill.
Simply put, they were completely devoid of “existence.”
Noar, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the World Wars, the traditional novel – with its experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background – has lost all conviction.
Which Forsyths, which Tibo and Rugon-Mackars, which even the Bolkons and Rostovs in general think after Verden, Auschwitz, and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated in the format of soap opera, and the criminal - i.e., by definition marginal - the novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett knew on his skin what it was like to work as a plumber on the front.
He was a communist.
How, by the way, were at least close to the party and such genre pillars as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassen, Joseph Lawsey, Edward Dmitrick.
Therefore, the nuar, the archetype of which they set, firstly, crude and cynical, and secondly, purely social.
This is hardly an American version of socialism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable precisely because it was unnatural, but organically combined the comic with Noah.
For the first time on the screen, the comic was alive, without any embarrassment of its graphic nature, and did not pretend to be a "real" film.
The darkness of the selling world, where the cardinal ordered the killings, and the senator covered the monstrous son-sadist, was quite worthy of Hammet's pen.
And the picturesque details such as the cut heads, with which the sadist decorated his nest, the feathers of the genius James Ellroy, the author of the "Black Orchid" and the best - that is, the declaratively slender - representative of the neonwar.
"The City of Sins-2" is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of Miller's radical stylisticism before the comic tradition.
This is probably due to 3D technology.
When you look at the second "City of Sins", you feel trapped in a glass ball, inside which the snow sleeps a toy log.
However, most often it is not snow, but blood stains, but for the most part, what is the difference?
About socializing and not talking about anything.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, somewhere we have sometimes, even on the edge of a dirty swamp, but there is a normal world where you can return a girl who has gone down the wrong path or, say, tell her parents that her killer has been punished.
When there is no place in the city for sin except sin, sin is no longer a sin, but a norm.
It's boring, like any normal.
The "City of Sins-2" chaos is just boring.
For the sake of justice, the domestic rent gave this fresh sin a small, but wig.
Titles warn: the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In relation to the spectacle, in the very vegetarian episode of which a man with his fingers is broken, it gives a hellish humor.
I'd like Hammett.
France's socialists should "lock down and bring France in order," says key ally Frasue Hollande
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left-wing forces to “show a warm attitude” to the attack on the socialist president, whose reshuffles have not been approved by the overwhelming majority of the French.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay close to him," he said, calling for applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured that his government would not challenge the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the conflicting proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new minister of economy, not this one.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande begged his Socialist Party comrades to remain “unique” with the government.
However, Christian Tober, the minister of justice, put sticks in the wheels, coming to the assembly of dissenting members of parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lose faith in the future.”
Marine Le Pe, the leader of the far-right National Front, expressed contempt for constant internal conflicts among socialists, saying she did not imagine the new Wally government would last longer than a few months.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande is a naked king, but a naked and prince Manuel Vall, forced to assemble a new government when the former did not last the summer.
"And the new one will not last autumn or winter either," Le Pen told reporters.
She reiterated her party’s call for the dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and was ready to run.
France’s ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A survey by the Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking up into several rival factions by the end of Mr. Holland’s 2017 presidential term.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at the University of Siena Po, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government fails to fix the economy and record unemployment.
“He has little time, but public opinion needs to quickly feel that something is changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
“A City Without Drugs” is Unclaimed
The Sverdlovsk arbitral tribunal has left without consideration the claim of the managing director of the regional ministry for the management of state property to the “City without Drugs” fund.
The Office intended to recover more than 7 million rubles from the organization as a fee for renting a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the arbitral tribunal of the Sverdlovsk region has left without consideration a claim by the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) to the "City without Drugs" Foundation (one of the founders - the Mayor of Yekaterinburg Evgeny Roizman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to recover from the organization 7.3 million rubles. as a fee for renting the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff did not appear twice in court, which is why a decision was taken to refuse the consideration.
The reason for the lack of representatives in the management of MUGISO could not explain, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer the phone calls.
The fund's representatives were also unable to contact.
Recall, it is a mansion that occupied the fund in the center of the city on Belinsky Street, 19 on a free basis since 2011.
This decision was made by the former governor, Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the managing director of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk Region filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court about the eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the agency demanded through the court to recognize an unencumbered contract of free use as the premises of the monument.
According to MUGISO, the agreement did not include significant conditions for the rental of a cultural heritage object.
The Sverdlovsk arbitration court rejected the claim, then an appeal was filed in the 17th Perm arbitration court, which was satisfied.
Then, in the same court, the fund filed a cassation complaint for this decision, which remained unsatisfactory, after which the decision was appealed by the fund in the Supreme Court of Arbitration, but the court accepted the direction.
In 2013, a new lease was signed, on which the fund began to pay the rent again, said the head of the city Evgeny Roizman.
The rent was assigned 300 thousand rubles. per month.
The previous administration of the area handed over this building to us for free, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, in a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration has decided otherwise," he said.
Tatiana Drogaeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg was asked to leave voluntarily
On July 24, the deputy of the pride of Yekaterinburg unicorn Alexander Kosyntsev proposed to the mayor of the city - the speaker of the pride of Yevgeny Roizman to resign.
The case was a criminal case against the arrested on suspicion of the murder of the pensioner of the deputy of the proud Oleg Kinev, who is considered to be a colleague of the mayor.
How Yevgeny Roizman found a criminal case
On July 1, it became known about the initiation of a criminal case on the fact of "claws" (Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of the mayor of Yekaterinburg Evgeny Roizman.
This was reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Sverdlovsk region, where Anna Filatov, Director General of the Legal Center "Protection", addressed with the corresponding statement.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her in his blog posts of being involved in crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth".
The iPhone will turn into a wallet.
In the run-up to Sept. 9, when Apple is due to present its new developments, there are new leaks in the press about what can be expected from the presentation.
According to sources, the sixth-generation iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of Apple’s joint project and payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re/code, at the presentation of new products on September 9, Apple can, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, resulting in a mobile wallet feature in the new iPhone 6 smartphone.
The companies themselves refuse to make any comments on this matter.
This feature allows you to make a payment at the cash register of the store with the help of a smartphone.
The payment identification will be performed by the user on his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be equipped with NFC (near field communication) technology for the first time, which allows you to make a contactless payment using your smartphone and the corresponding reading device on the cash register.
The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (former Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC function was first introduced back in 2004 as part of the collaboration of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that joined the so-called NFC Forum, an association for the advancement of this technology.
The first phone with NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC function - Samsung Nexus S - was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced a Google Wallet system that allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay with a smartphone on Android.
However, U.S. experts emphasize that, despite the large investments of high-tech companies in promoting NFC technology, U.S. retailers are still cautious about innovation and do not spend too much money on the equipment of their stores with such systems.
Therefore, now observers hope that Apple’s entry into this market will still force retailers to accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their trading points.
France's Foreign Ministry: Paris's position on deliveries to Russia "Mistrals" remains unchanged
French Foreign Ministry official Rom<0xC3><0xA2>n Nadal said on the unchanged position of Paris regarding the delivery of Russian helicopter carriers of the type "Mistral".
"I can recall the statement of the President of the Republic (Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande) made in an interview with Le Monde on August 20: 'Today, the level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
This is a decision of the Europeans, not of France," Nadal quoted RIA Novosti as saying.
Thus, the representative of the French foreign policy department answered the question of whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will not affect the change of the position of Paris on the implementation of this contract.

Norwegian Cruise is approaching a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise operator, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire a similar company Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to reports from people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to luxury cruise ships and Prestige Cruises as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (NCC).
The deal could be announced as early as this week, sources said on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
Prestige Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise’s shares.
The sources asked to remain unnamed, as the negotiations were not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
The Miami-based Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, up 13 percent from 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships that travel to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported income of $1.2 billion in 2013, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
It is expected that the $29 billion cruise industry will have a favorable impact on the growth of the middle class in developing economies such as China and India in the coming years.
Overtaking companies aim to position themselves as cruise operators, which are preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulators for the initial public placement of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's main shareholder after a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it exists today, in 2000 as a result of a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), an entertainment conglomerate and a casino controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in the Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January of 2013.
Genting owned a 28 percent stake, Apollo owned a 20 percent stake, and private investment firm TPG Capital LP owned an 8 percent stake in the company, according to data at the end of June, according to the report.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 percent of the cruise flow in North America, according to registration documents at the first public placement of Prestige Cruises shares.

Hong Kong Democratic Movement Activists Break Chinese Representative's Speech The Next Day After Decision About Elections
A group of citizens, loyal to Beijing, stood nearby waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the All-China Assembly of People's Representatives on Sunday set a procedure by which only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the 2017 Hong Kong presidential election.
All candidates must first get the support of the majority of the members of the nomination committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get into the ballot box and has forced the activists of the democratic movement to re-promise to stop Hong Kong’s financial center by “Occupy Central” protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing’s publication of a document describing China’s control of Hong Kong, in June, activists of the democratic movement held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the business center of the city and held a sitting party.
Briefing Lee is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Bureau of Communications in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-China People's Assembly, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Office of State Council Feng Wei were also expected to address a series of briefings during the day.
Activist students said they would meet at the Hong Kong government headquarters in the afternoon.
The UK did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last 150 days of its colonial rule.
Israeli authorities plan to join 400 hectares of land owned by Palestinian Authority (PA)
The Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to join 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, which is owned by the Palestinian Authority.
According to the BBC, the decision to join South Bethlehem is linked to a desire to pay for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June of this year.
On Sunday, Israel’s Defense Ministry announced the seizure of the territory and ordered the military to establish an administrative administration on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, the global public should call on Israel to respond to “continuing settlement activity on the west bank of Jordan and in East Jerusalem.”
Putin calls on Kiev to start negotiations on the "statehood" of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports about his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the separated region.
His press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not intend to suggest that the eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needs to be revised to give its Russian-speaking region an opportunity to defend its interests.
However, Putin’s call to the Kiev government to start negotiations with pro-Russian rebels as with the equals corresponded to the obvious strategy, which he followed from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help the separatists take territory and to force the Ukrainian government not to give novossyn to novosyn.
In an interview with the state TV channel First, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the return of the territory held by separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea.
The Kremlin and the separatists recently called the occupied territories Novorossiya, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peace talks will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians start campaigning for parliamentary elections on October 26 and while government troops are attacking peaceful settlements in the detained separatist regions, "Tzil.
"We must immediately begin substantive negotiations not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of South-Eastern Ukraine, in order to realize the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which was discussed over the months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The intervention of the Kremlin’s press secretary to correct the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s words underscored the decision of the Russian leadership to behave towards the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2-million-ethnic population.
Moscow would have to endure a much more difficult battle to join even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian, and surveys before the start of the conflict showed broad support for Ukraine’s desire to stay inside.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed at international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to define trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact, by handing the Kremlin actual control over the territory that would connect Russia’s main territory with Crimea.
On the Black Sea peninsula, joined five months ago, is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic marine resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea there are also mines, factories and ironworks, which produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inaugural speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers after the new elections should weigh amendments to the constitution, allowing the separated regions to give more control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose weapons and instigation are blamed on Moscow.
Putin’s last call to Kiev to agree with separatist leaders, as with the equals, followed a new insurgency last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a pre-peace zone along the Sea of Azov.
Russia-backed separatists took control of the city of Novoazovsk in an attack, which Ukrainian security officials say is feared to be the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory up to the Crimea itself.
This resulted in large-scale civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsky and a narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday appealed to the European Union’s leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
“We are approaching the point of no return,” Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a draft of more severe sanctions against Russia, which will be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the experiencing difficulties of the separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko in the Ukrainian press and the national security secretary of the Council.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who are reportedly detained in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airmen captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
The scandal with nude photos captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelstein expressed his disgust at the hackers who may have stolen nude photos of his wife Gabi Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged after a series of undisclosed photos featuring nude Jennifer Lawrence were leaked to the internet as a result of a large-scale hacker scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 revealed photos of the star of the "Hunger Games" Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Apton and Kara Delevin, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lia Michelle and actress Kirsten Dain.
Australian actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne-based Greco also allegedly stole photos as a result of a leak from iCloud.
There are 101 names on the list.
Edelstein, who made Greece’s offer last month, told Confidential: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and photos must remain private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and passed on to other people.
Greco, who is in New York City, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was “shameful” and that those to whom it was targeted “feels like they’ve been hacked.”
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with a former boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two footage of her lying in a pool with a bare chest.
Palmer's work in cinema includes "Love and Honor" along with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the film "Chuck" Strahovski and the actress from "Prohibited Reception" Browning did not comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
Representative Lawrence told TMZ: “This is a sudden invasion of private life.”
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his displeasure at the hacker, writing on Twitter: "To post photos stolen from a mobile phone, in fact, is nothing different from selling stolen goods."
From a legal point of view, it is impossible to tolerate the publication of stolen photos.
A potential way to steal photos of naked celebrities has been discovered
The massive burst of star accounts may have been caused by a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
The potential scenario for the development of events described the resource The Next Web.
On the Github resource was published a script in Python, which allowed you to select passwords for Apple’s Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
To access it, the same link of the login and password Apple ID is used, as well as to access the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed the method to retrieve the password from Find My Phone.
In this method, all sorts of combinations of symbols are introduced consecutively, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that in Find My Phone the number of password options to be entered is unlimited.
If the security system is set up correctly after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account must be blocked and inform the user of the attempted breach.
Due to the vulnerability, users did not receive any messages about the attempt to select a password to their account.
Hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a Twitter user, Hackapp, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a scripting program was written to it to select passwords.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted Hackapp user and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability is characteristic of many services, however he noted that there is no evidence that such vulnerability was used to access the "star" account.
It's not me, plz RT
On Twitter, the Prime Minister once again appeared foreign records.
While there is no solid evidence that a vulnerability has been used in Find My Phone to steal photos, there has been a wave of malicious actions using this service before.
Hackers seized control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that in this case, cloud security was not compromised, but did not conduct investigations into how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the tweet of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was also previously hacked.
If attackers gained access to iCloud in the manner described above, the password to the account of the head of government in the microblogging service could also be stored there.
The Next Web resource failed to receive comments from Apple about the vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian Five-Board
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to the well-known Ukrainian athlete Anne Buryak.
The corresponding decree is published on the Internet portal of legal information.
Earlier this year, the athlete moved to Russia to a permanent place of residence and applied to the Federation of Modern Fives with a request to give her the opportunity to speak for the Russian national team.
In 2013, she won two stages of the World Cup, won the silver medal of the European Championship in a personal championship and became a world champion in a mixed relay, which is one of the new types of program in this form of sport.
It holds leading positions in the current season as well.
According to the rules, to perform at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, she will need to get special permission from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change her nationality.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to chess player Ekaterina Lagno - a native of Lviv, which is a two-time European champion (2005, 2008), a world champion (2010) and fast chess (2014).
As part of the women's team of Ukraine, the athlete became the winner of the Chess Olympiad in Turin (2006), the World Team Championship in Astana (2013) and the European Team Championship in Warsaw (2013).
The SCRC has stopped the investigation of the Tu-204 disaster in Vnukovo
The Investigative Committee of Russia (SCR) has suspended the criminal case on the fact of the crash of the Tu-204 aircraft of the Red Wings airline.
This is reported by the press service of the department.
The decision was made in connection with the death of the commander of the aircraft and the flight engineer.
The forensic examination showed that the cause of the disaster was the increased speed of take-off, failure by the crew of the standard procedures on landing, as well as the unintended exit of the engines for increased direct-tension turns.
The Tu-204 aircraft of the Red Wings, which followed the flight from Prague to Moscow, suffered a crash on December 29, 2012 when landing at Moscow’s Vnukovo airport.
The airship went out behind the runway and burned down.
At the scene of the accident, the commander of the aircraft, the second pilot and a flight engineer were killed.
Two onboard conductors were taken to medical facilities, where they subsequently died from the injuries received.
Three other onboard conductors, hospitalized with severe bodily injury, underwent long-term treatment.
In addition, serious bodily damage was received by the driver of the car, which was moving at the time of the accident on the Kiev highway.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
The transport prosecutor's office after the crash conducted a check at the Red Wings, during which numerous violations were identified.
In February 2013, the airline’s license was suspended.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.

Emelyanenko was placed under arrest until 31 August, and on 1 September the sentence was imposed.
However, the court was postponed, and the investigation insisted on extending the detention period until 30 September.
In the event that the athlete’s guilt is proven, he is threatened with imprisonment for up to six years.
What's your strength, brother?
"Lenta.ru" recalls the most scandalous stories in the career of Alexander Emelyanenko
Emelyanenko held his last match in January of this year, losing his technical knockout to compatriot Dmitry Sosnovsky.
Alexander is the younger brother of the more famous fighter Fedor Emelyanenko.
The latter is a four-time world champion in mixed martial arts, a four-time world champion and a seven-time Russian champion in combat sambo.
Anger was the most universal and functional emotion of man.
A person’s harsh expression is biologically universal to humanity, and every person involved in its creation is not a random organ and muscle group, but is an additional means of expressing power and threat, Australian and U.S. scientists have found.
They told about their discoveries in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them can be read in the press release of the University of California, Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face - moved and lowered down the eyebrows, stretched into a thin line of lips, swollen nostrils - is the same in all cultures, and makes it even blind from the birth of children, who have never seen it, notes the lead author of the study Aaron.
As part of a major research project dedicated to the nature of anger, the researchers found that this emotion was created for the effective conduct of disputes during the conflict.
The more physical damage one person can inflict on another, the more he has the ability to dictate his conditions, and he brings it to the interlocutor by means of anger.
The researchers found evidence and another of their hypotheses: physically strong people are more likely to get angry and switch to handcuffs, consider themselves entitled to impose conditions on others that are not beneficial to them, and prefer force-based methods of resolving conflicts peacefully.
Relying on the fact that anger is first and foremost an “emotion of bargaining”, the scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of muscles that create the angry expression of the face should represent the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor – and thus force him to concur with his condition as possible.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers modeled on the computer of the face, where each of the seven elements of the angry face was present or absent, and showed them to the informants.
Although abandoned eyebrows or protruded eyebrows did not make the face evil in isolation, the person depicted with such traits as the stronger physical participants of the study admitted unanimously.
Man’s anger, like animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of one’s own strength, forcing one to agree and obey.
A man shakes his nostrils and presses his lips with the same purpose as a spoon that is soaked, or a granny that shows off his claws.
Anger "starts" by the refusal of the interlocutor to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form, as effectively as possible demonstrating the opposite side of the consequences of this refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of the angry face is arbitrary, they all express the same thing,” said anthropologist John Tubby.
The Ministry of Communications proposed to allocate 250 million rubles of the TV company "Crimea"
In 2014, the Ministry of Communications proposed to allocate 250 million rubles from the federal budget of the autonomous non-profit organization "Teleradio Company "Crime".
This is stated in the draft resolution of the Government prepared by the Ministry, which was introduced by "Lenta.ru".
According to the explanatory note to the project, subsidies from the federal budget will be directed "to cover the costs of creating the conditions for large-scale informational coverage of the socio-economic situation and development of the modern information space on the territory of the Republic of Crimea".
In particular, the money allocated is supposed to be converted into a hardware-studio block, a video wall, a central hardware and a video server.
It is also planned to purchase a mobile TV station and satellite transmitter.
In addition, from the allocated funds, the company will pay for the use of fiber-optic communication line (VOLS) and the repair of the energy system.
Subsidies will be provided within the limits of the federal budget provided for the Ministry of Communications.
The state television broadcasting company "Crimea" was established in 1959, broadcasting in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, the coverage of the television signal of the television company is more than 75 percent of the territory of the peninsula.
In 2011, the TV company "Crime" received a license for television broadcasting in digital format.
