28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a stairwell of a local mall this week.
However, the victim’s brother says that he can’t imagine someone who would want to hurt him, noting: “Finally his business went smoothly.”
“The body, found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia,” the San Francisco forensics office said in a statement.
The San Francisco Police Department says the death has been classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Luis Galicia, told ABC’s KGO in San Francisco that Frank, a past chef at Boston’s distribution line, got his dream job as a chef at San Francisco’s Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and suppressed" by his death.
"We are a small team that works as a friendly family and will miss him very much," he said.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Luis Galicia said that Frank first stopped at the hostels, but recently “Finally his business went smoothly.”
“He found the apartment, he met the girl,” Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galicia said he couldn’t imagine someone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good heart and a good heart.
His way of connecting with the family was always to prepare us some food, to prepare us dinner,” said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any dispute.
He was the brother who was swimming in the stream.
“Despite all the bad things that are happening to this world, it was that limitless diamond that was shining brightly every day,” he said.

Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years.
An international group of biologists has come to the conclusion that the longest-living vertebrate animal is the Greenlandic polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, RT reports.
The scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the crucible of the eyes of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, whose length exceeds five meters, can be from 272 to 512 years.
Biologists believe that an important role in the longevity of sharks plays a low metabolism, which leads to slow development.
Females of Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity only by 150 years.
It was previously thought that the longest of all vertebrate animals lives the "neighbor" of the shark - the Greenlandic whale.
The oldest person known to scientists was just over 210 years old.

Is it worth going to the sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the main doctor of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to the sanatorium?
Sanatorium and resort rest is necessary not only for the treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
In the conditions of the sanatorium, a person can check the condition of his body and get recommendations from a doctor how to live so that his health does not deteriorate.
Such recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal of the body, it is not worth to shy away from it.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and a syndrome of chronic fatigue.
And the stress is experienced by about 90% of those who come.
He is most exposed to people from large cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it is better not to complicate the situation and give yourself time to rest.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age during their stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable rest for the whole family.
So, if you want to spend a vacation with children, you won’t have to break up with them.
For children, even the youngest, health programs are provided, which include both diagnostic services, pediatric consultation, analysis, and therapeutics.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's pools), inhaling, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, therapeutic physical culture.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor taking into account the individual indications and features of the growing organism.
In addition, in sanatoriums, usually a children's club works with animators, where children can attend game classes, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with babies, provide the necessary conditions for the midwives and provide the services of an experienced nanny.
The mild winter, the long summer, the abundance of sunny days per year (more than 300) create good conditions for year-round recreation in the resorts of the Caucasian Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So do not be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most procedures are carried out in the room and do not depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium and resort treatment is desirable to carry out 2 times a year, especially for adults.
The main fissure of the region of the Caucasian Mineral Waters, of course, the healing mineral sources: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuky, Narzan.
Their water has unique properties and affects different systems of the body.
Water varies by temperature, number of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects water depending on the patient's self-esteem.
Thus, "Narzan" has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating action, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
Essentuki-4 affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces the level of sugar.
"Essentuks new" has an anti-inflammatory, bile and urticaria effect.
The same effects also have the water "Slavyanovska".
When appointing water, the doctor must take into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it selects less salt water because the salts hold the fluid, which leads to an increase in pressure.
The intake of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: the water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and at a specific temperature.
Currently, various cosmetological procedures for the face and body are available in sanatoriums.
What types of healing, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, can be obtained in the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is a salt lake Tambukan, an ivy mud from which is useful for joints, spine, internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, suppressing, immunomodulating effect.
These are health-promoting walks along individually designed routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is in close proximity to the mineral source "Narzan".
There you can also take the baths wine, pearly, iodine-bromine, selenium, sage-lacric, depending on what your doctor will prescribe.
Let's prolong the fertilization.
What to do to keep the harvest going until the end of the season?
Narrated by Yulia Belopukhova, agronomist and daughter-in-law.
It is time for high-growth tomatoes to arrange a haircut: to remove new shoots, cut the muffins, remove all the leaves until the last cyst with fruits and flowering with small ligaments - will not be able to mature.
All tomatoes, regardless of the "constitution", as well as peppers and eggplants are fed with zolon-superphosphate extract, processed with biopreparations (Osperator - to accelerate the flow and growth of fruits, Phytosporin-M, Phytolavin, Gamair, Bactophyte - for the disease
Only copper copper, colloidal sulfur and green soap should be used from chemicals at the end of the summer.
We're making the last potion of plants.
Long-legged cucumbers in the greenhouse are sucked from the wallpaper so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, soaked with warm water and a solution of Zirconia, suck the stem 5-7 cm of the compost.
Extending the fertilization of the cabbage is also not difficult: cut the old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, pour the fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against nighttime colds, install over the ridge of the arc with cover material.
During the day, keep the plant open, and after sunset close.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is getting out of the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s exit from the longest in the last twenty years of the recession.
According to analysts polled by Bloomberg, the GDP of the Russian Federation is showing a positive dynamic - in the second quarter GDP decreased by 0.8% in annual terms.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, the decline of the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6%.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development have also recently announced the stabilization of the situation.
Forward is slow growth.
According to experts of the Central Bank, the recession in the Russian economy has remained in the past.
“The index estimate of Russian GDP shows that the recession is behind and ahead of the slow growth of the economy,” says the Bank of Russia’s bulletin “What the trends are saying.”
The modular estimate of GDP in the current quarter of the regulator has increased to 0.4%, the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter the decline of GDP of the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally-cleaned decline in GDP was 0.2% to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline stopped: in April it was 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was within 0-0.15”, – RIA Novosti MERCEDES-MER representative.
The slowdown in the decline of the Russian economy over the last five quarters indicates that the “bottom has passed”.
Among other markers pointing to signs of a revival of the national economy, Bloomberg calls the rise in demand for electricity and rail transport, a revival of business.
If you make a correction to the fact that the year is high, it is clear that the dynamics plus 1% of electricity consumption can be due in half to the additional working day.
Let’s add to this a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight transport, but it is difficult to get accurate data here, and a plus-minus of 0.5% of half-year volume can also be explained by seasonality,” explains Kirill Yakovenko of ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, a reduction in price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2%, compared to 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, the last two weeks Rosstat has fixed deflation.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble rate, which, although showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, according to the results of August since the beginning of the year has strengthened by 12%.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy”, - emphasizes Yakovenko.
In addition, since April, there has been an increase in the volume of industrial production in the Russian Federation.
In June, the figure grew by 1.7%.
The rate of foreign trade declines from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
The positive dynamics is also demonstrated by the situation in the labour market, where the unemployment rate has decreased to 5.4%.
Below it was only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the well-being of the labour market, the question of the real disposable income of the population is left to want the best.
In annual terms, the figure is reduced by 4.8%.
This factor can hamper the recovery of the economy, as household expenditures make a significant contribution to GDP.
As a rule, in the structure of the economy, their share exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, as risk factors for economic growth can also be called the strict policy of the Bank of Russia.
The regulator holds the rate at 10.5%, which does not have the best impact on the real sector.
A negative factor is and is not a sufficiently high level of investment, which inhibits the development of industrial capacity.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year, the rate of decline of the Russian economy will slow to -0.5% versus -3.7% in 2015," says Irina Rogova, an analyst at the Forex Club.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well experienced in winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi, has not yet been so actively developed in summer sports.
If the Olympic Games in Rio are for Russia and the former foreigners speak, then in most cases they are the nationals of the countries of the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro we can observe the reverse process - a fairly large number of Russians are under the flags of other states.
In each case, the history of citizenship change is different.
Some parents moved to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone did not stand the competition for a place in the Russian national team.
And someone thought that the best conditions for development in sports will be created abroad.
AiF.ru has found at least 16 athletes who have decided to change their Russian citizenship.
In the German passport, a 27-year-old girl is written that her name is Lisa Ryzhich.
But before that, she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Just four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to do light athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose to jump with six.
If she stayed in Russia, she would hardly be able to "lift from the throne" Elena Isinbayev.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio Lisa will be our only landlady, though former, in the jump sector with six.
Her best achievements in this sport are the bronze of the 2010 European Championship and the silver of the 2016 continental championship, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
Elena Pirojkova, 29, was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandists of the evangelical direction.
Mostly because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was just three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena started to get interested in fighting when she was in school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where at the U.S. Combat Training Center she continued her classes under the guidance of another former Russian Vladislav Izboynikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first match.
But at the World Cup that year, it was a win.
By the way, she managed to win silver at the 2010 World Cup.
After that, there was bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in the city of Yaroslavl, where she first met with synchronous swimming.
But to say that it was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
Mary continued her studies there.
Soon she was already part of the U.S. team and showed great results at the Pan American Games.
It is understandable that on a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America, its indicators are the ceiling.
The new name, which in Russian sounds strange, Kristina Shaldibina received at the age of 11 when her parents decided to continue training a girl in art gymnastics overseas.
Until now, the girl was engaged in a favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
Emigrating to the United States, she quickly entered the country’s youth team, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For the first positions on the world stage, of course, she did not have to fight, but for the United States she organized a real breakthrough - brought out the star-studded team at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another one of our former "artist" - Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who stands for the German national team.
She was born in Togliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany - where the girl had more prospects to get into the national team.
Soon she represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, however, Jana was able to take only 17th place, not enough to get into the finals in the personal championship.
But two years before that, she managed to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games - the Youth Games.
Another gymnast, only this time sports - Irina Sazonova.
If the emigration routes mentioned above can be called standard, then the choice of the Irina family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a student of the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland she immediately became the champion of the country.
True, Ira is still training in Russia - he especially comes to his homeland so as not to lose his skills.
In Rio, she did not perform as well as she wanted.
The best place is 40 in personal multiplayer.
There is very little information about Maria Ugolkova’s swimming in the Russian information space.
For a very long time, Maria lived and trained in Switzerland.
However, for a long time she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - there was even a record of the country at a distance of 200 meters batterfly.
In 2015, she was granted Swiss citizenship and began performing under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th place in the comprehensive relay 4<0xC3><0x97>100.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to collect about 6 thousand francs, which allowed her to pay for the preparation for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle fighter Adam Batirov spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Hasavurt managed to become a three-time winner of the European Championships, champion of Russia, master of sports of the international class of Russia.
When he stopped getting into our national team, it was time to think about a change of nationality.
For several years, a talented fighter disappeared from the sports bridges.
The triumphal return took place at the 2016 Asian Championships - Batirov already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a trip to the Olympics in Rio.
About another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, even less is known in his homeland than even about the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkov.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was quite small.
That’s where Michael started to play sports.
It has not achieved much success at the international level.
In Rio his best result was 40th place in the qualifiers in parallel matches.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympic Games in sports gymnastics is already a breakthrough.
When Naste, who was born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family immigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her lessons in synchronous swimming, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in the synchronous swimming.
In a duet with Eugenie Tetelbaum, Anastasia took eighth place.
She was fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kroyter is a member of the Israel national team.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry became the country’s champion.
That same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Kroiter also won the gold at the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to jumping in height, Dmitri is engaged in long jumps and triple jumps.
The 31-year-old Albert is another native of Hasavurt, who after long speeches for Russia has decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batyrov, Albert chose Romania, which he would represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the Krasnoyarsk High School of Sports, in 2011 he even became the champion of the country.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of player of the USSR volleyball team Yaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family remained there for a permanent residence.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became the bronze medalist of the European Championship, held in the territory of his new homeland.
Hadzhiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and got along with his family at the height of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but this northern country failed to get – had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to study free combat.
Soon he won the world championship among the juniors, and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the tournament.
And once again a free struggle, and once again a former Russian.
This time it will be about a native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain, - about Timemuraze Frieve.
At the end of December 2012, he was given Spanish citizenship, and he currently plays for the national team.
Before that, however, the 30-year-old athlete managed to score high results in Russia as well.
He became a bronze medalist at the 2007 and 2008 national championships.
Stating not to enter the national team, Taimuraz decided to change his sports citizenship.
The last in our list is the Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Mahachkale, - Arthur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took his family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began to do boxing.
Since then, Arthur has become the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he became the world champion among young people.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won gold at the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Why Do Cossacks Have Classrooms in Schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratiev, “the Kazakhs need to be educated not by actions and parades, but systematically.”
They must grow and at least 7 years old understand that they are Cossacks and education must be Cossacks.
But so far this work seems to me to be formally conducted and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes incorporate all the positives that accumulated earlier, on a qualitatively new level, I will be glad.
If all of them were caught up and unknown how, the new idea would turn into cheap populism.
ZKH continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country’s economy.
There is a place for the pursuit of funds allocated to the needs of the communal sphere from budgets of different levels.
According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, excessive tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the field of HDCs.
As a result, consumers of the region overpaid the energy companies more than 170 million rubles.
On the day and the Prosecutor’s Office of Krasnodar region revealed the facts of the inclusion in the tariffs of unjustified costs.
And in the costs of LLC "IV-consulting" (on the basis of cold water) 4 million rubles. for the rental of cars at a price above the market price.
And such examples in the country of mass.
The people give the last money for the "communal", and pay correctly, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94%.
He is immediately accused of several articles of the Criminal Code: loss of life, legalization of income received by criminal means, abuse of powers, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, which was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, work on it was not actually carried out, but paid for.
Businessmen just gave him most of the money back.
And as the owner of the uk, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay the service providers and spent them for their needs.
As a result of the damage to the budget and residents - millions of rubles.
Makarov’s machinations scheme, unfortunately, is typical for Russia.
A whole wave of arrests and arrests of the leaders of the UK, who gave money to citizens, swept through the country.
The trial of A. Kohan, by the way, is ongoing in Kamchatka, also a former deputy of the city council, which is accused of machinations of 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013 in the Elizovo Kamchatka region, he established 6 management companies and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them performed contract work for the UC, the other two played the role of accounting and cash centers, i.e. received money from the population.
However, A. Kohan did not list the funds, but spent on himself, the beloved.
It is quite difficult to judge in the field of HRC.
Things don’t get excited, they get delayed.
And "helps" in this extremely complicated housing legislation, - believes Svetlana Razvorotneva, the executive director of NP "ZKH Kontrol".
We fail to earn one law as we devise a new one that must force the previous one to work.
There are very few specialists, including among the judges, in the field of HRH.
Lawyers themselves admit that very little attention is paid to housing law in universities.
The refusals to initiate criminal cases, the fibers in the course of the investigations are also mentioned in the General Prosecutor's Office.
Of the 3.5 thousand crimes in the trial in 2015, less than half were sent to court.
The rest of the investigation was delayed, and one in five was suspended in connection with the failure to identify the accused.
Often, deficiencies in the activities of law enforcement agencies are attributed to gaps in the current legislation.
The law is there, but the intelligence agencies are not in a hurry to provoke and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of fraud - only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
During the five months of the current year, their number has increased only slightly - 99.
And what is the falsification of the protocol of the assembly of inhabitants?
This means that changes in the management of the house, financial and other issues are bypassing the opinion of the owners.
And this also means that the market for residential and communal services can not break into normal companies that want to work honestly, and not "drain" the population.
It turns out that residents in the past, small and medium-sized businesses as well.
First of all, because of the eradication of corruption as such throughout the state, is convinced by Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property.
And now this work is actively being done.
It’s not just individual actions – it’s a targeted course to fight corruption.
Of course, not all regions are in such a sad situation.
In particular, in the capital there are scandals and do not smell.
Why are there no such scandals in Moscow in the field of HQs, as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital government showed an iron will and put in order, - said Anatoly Electoral, member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I mean both the personnel issue, the legislative amendments, and the legal education.
For managing companies, close supervision was established, and they all went through licensing.
Complaints of citizens are promptly resolved in the public space (both appeals of residents, and response measures are posted on the portal of the Moscow government).
Many people do not just pay monthly receipts, but carefully monitor what is written there, how the house is contained.
The awareness among the population of the rights of owners and obligations of resource-providing and managing organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow checks the validity of tariffs on housing and municipal services - because a small part of the budget funds goes to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
All of this together may explain the calm situation in Moscow.
Is it all based on the will of the local government?
Is it possible to be free to change jobs?
The Turkish Gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to abandon his friendship with the EU and the US?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an has put forward the U.S. ultimatum, proposing to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup d’état.
He said this in a speech to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an called on the Americans to give up support for the “terrorist organization of the Fethullahists.”
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States is calling for a change in its position.
Experts believe that the split in Turkey’s relations with the West is increasing and could lead to a new attempt to change the country’s power.
Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and the FET (Fethullah Terrorist Organization).
Either the organizing revolutions of the FETO, or the democratic Turkey.
She must make this choice,” the Anatolian agency quoted Erdogan’s address, which sounded on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The president of Turkey once again, but has already demanded more stringently from the United States to comply with his demand, which he voiced for the first time immediately after the suppression of the rebellion.
Recall that on the night of 16 July in Turkey, the high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army made an attempt to overthrow the legitimate power in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an addressed the population, the rebellion was suppressed, and its organizers and participants were arrested.
A total of about 8,000 people were suspected, among whom, in addition to the military, there were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania.
Erdogan’s supporters also admitted that the coup could also be directly interfered with by the Americans.
The U.S. rejected all claims to its address, refusing to issue Gulen and advising to change the tone.
The last statement by the State Department on this account was made at the time of Erdogan’s visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey – he insists on his own and also puts demands on other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union unless Brussels calls for the date of the lifting of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens," Turkey's Minister for EU Affairs Omer Chelik said on August 9.
According to him, Ankara’s amendments to the anti-terrorist law, as the EU demands, will put Europe’s own security at risk.
On August 1, German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel called on Turkey to stop blackmailing the European Union by promising to open borders for migrants in order to facilitate visa regime with the EU.
His words were in response to a corresponding statement by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Chavushoglu.
Chavushoglu made another provocative statement last Wednesday, admitting that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry has not ruled out that the country will consider leaving the alliance if it does not meet the expected support from it.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defense sphere is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign states in the defense sphere, - they import missiles," Chavushoglu said in an interview with Anadolu Agency.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defence system based on its technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
“Until now, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have started looking for others,” he said.
Experts believe that all this speaks to Turkey’s serious differences with the West and the country’s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise Evgeniy Minchenko believes that Recep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go into a tough confrontation with the West.
It has a lot of ties to the West both in terms of business and in terms of military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdogan will try to balance, maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a fully obedient person in this position,” the AIF.ru expert explained.
According to him, it is not excluded that after the statements of the Turkish leader (about the non-payment of EU compensation, the requirement of visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gulen from the United States) will press on him.
“Rjep Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will pressure him on humanitarian issues, dictatorial methods of country governance and so on,” Minchenko said.
The head of the Center for Political Information Alexey Mukhin admits that the President of Turkey will change his point of view on relations with Russia as soon as it is beneficial to him.
Eight months ago, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an took an extremely tough stance on Russia and in every way sought favor in the West.
In a very short time, the situation has changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that, after a while, the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again.
I think Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an has entered a period of intractable diplomacy.
Being between two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," Mukhin said.
According to him, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to retain political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and the partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which use it to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached,” the expert said.
Another point of view is the head of the Center of Asia and the Middle East Anna Glazov.
At present, relations between Turkey and the EU and the United States are quite tense, and this is primarily due to the internal policies that Erdogan personally conducts.
I think that this crisis in relations will be exacerbated, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to relaunch policy both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is not by chance that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, declare that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, the relations with Israel are settled, there is an active political interaction with Iran," said AiF.ru Glazova, a spokesman.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is now pursuing is a return to the course of the foreign policy concept followed by Turkey before the beginning of the Arab revolutions.
“It was then that Turkey began to actively develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in the positions of zero problems with its neighbours.
Now, very successful visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and the countries of Africa have been made.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey’s positions both on the regional and international arenas,” the expert said.
Glasova believes that it will be incredibly difficult to return Turkey to previous relations with the EU, and now the question is whether the EU will start to respond harshly to Turkey, which can open borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Young Doctors’ Strike: Calls for New Collective Protests
The representatives of the junior doctors appealed to the trade union with a request to sanction new collective protests in their dispute over the new employment contract.
The British Medical Association’s (BMA) Committee of Young Physicians (JDC) is going to ask its full council to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC says ministers have failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
Younger doctors and medical students in July voted to cancel a contract of employment deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had continued to "resist heavily" on issues that, she said, led to the rejection of the labor contract.
“Given the current situation, the JDC leader has voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in full and has called for formal renegotiations on all your issues,” she said.
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC leader today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program to expand collective protests starting in early September.
The dispute led to young doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first general strike in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of BMA’s junior doctors, Dr. Joan Malavan, resigned after voting for the cancellation of the agreed terms of the employment contract, which BMA recommended.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good one to take, during meetings ahead of the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the employment contract would be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: “The Alliance of the Bad”?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had a lasting impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile seemed tense, and he hardly radiated heat even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, in contrast, has repeatedly spoken about his “Dear Friend” to Mr. Putin — five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But the protracted cold, emanating from Mr. Putin, showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first one he mentioned in the introductory comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was inconceivable.
Mr. Putin was outraged by the angry tyrant, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
The grief was even stronger, based on an alleged friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a stunning, total attack on Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious of the allegations were from senior leadership officials that Mr. Erdogan’s own family had used to illegally trade oil from Syria’s so-called Islamic State-controlled areas.
He strongly denied it.
But in St. Petersburg there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of its kind.
For Ankara, the advantage of announcing the truce is clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost thrown out of his post last month in an attempt to turn around.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have clearly shocked him as well.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions hit hard – especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number fell sharply by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here, of course, will feel relief when the flights finally resume.
They put the end of the season on the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products will be allowed again.
"Tourists are there, tomatoes are back here," according to a report in the Vedomosti newspaper.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is evil in the West for what it considers to be a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this its lingering dissatisfaction with the tortuous pace of talks on joining the EU and Mr. Putin’s move — which seeks to take advantage of the cold and gradually destroy Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for the support of the elected authorities after an attempt at a coup d’état.
Bear in mind, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So, the summit in this splendid palace on the sea coast allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as an “alignment of the bad”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West are joining forces.
However, despite the public display of reconciliation, these two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
Perhaps it speaks for itself that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents gave a press conference, they did not even touch on the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on how they can find a common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility – and taking into account the possibility of a full disaster, when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter – it’s certainly better that the two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to the role of back office, according to the bank’s executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEvan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has retreated from them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During this period, brand strategies used “RBS” to protect other consumer credit brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship assistance to international sports, from the six-nation Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the banking service of private individuals that will get more influence – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during a tour of clients and employees at Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our staff will be engaged because we are now becoming to a greater extent a bank of brands.”
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am saying now that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their population groups, and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
RBS has already said that it will not continue its sponsorship support for the Six Nations Cup, and it is increasing the profile of various brands in sponsoring the sport.
“It’s a good time for us to move the bank of brands, because basically (we asked ourselves) how we focus on improving the bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great bank for customers and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we’ve done focusing on customer needs rather than on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can return these brands again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with a Newmarket victory at the Passion
Dettori shakes champagne after a double in the Newmarket leads him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori scored his 3000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track - the Passion taught by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this outstanding mark in smooth jumps.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lesteur Piggott, Pat Iddere, and Willie Carson.
Three-time Joke Champion Dettori, who had previously won at Ghayyar, said: “It’s something special.”
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I’m very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because that’s where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big world event, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am free from business and very unattractive.
Children accept applause when they bring Predisposition after victory.
Two jockeys achieved such a mark in hurdles jumps: jockey champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 wins for a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is not surprising that he achieved this mark, which so few have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical smile that sets him apart from others in the weight room.
He is a great representative for jumping, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if it wasn't just a joke of weekends and big jumps!
And seriously, Frankie has been leading the winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He’s an energetic character who’s good for British jumps, but more than that, he’s an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori Celebrated This Distinguished Sign of the Firm's Fast Jumping Horse
From fast-paced finish to fast-paced jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth jumps for two decades.
They were ups and downs.
Many of the big jump winners, including his famous "Wonderful Seven" at Ascot in 1996, but he also suffered a plane crash and was disqualified due to doping.
Three years ago he first faced difficulties when he returned after a six-month disqualification, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge the skeptics and return to form.
And he may not have finished for some time yet — Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue competing at least until the age of 50.
Putin fires head of administration Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his head of administration Sergey Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted close circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as a representative for the environment and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin says that Putin “has decided to free Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the president,” but did not state the reason.
Mr. Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Weino, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Weino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
He was later head of the administration of the president’s protocol and the government’s apparatus, reports the Kremlin’s website (in Russian).
During the appointment, he told Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as heads of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are executed.
Putin told a Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be released from this post and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a move that has puzzled Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on state television, the two men said the head of the administration resigned at his own will.
But in spite of the smiles on the camera, it has convinced few people here — especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unforeseen consequences of some kind of power struggle?
Until no one knows.
But the official statement — that the person for whom they once campaigned as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russia’s environmental policy — was met with enormous skepticism.
In remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said: “It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you in the conversation to entrust me with this very difficult position, even, to say, a problematic position, for four years.
Well, it turns out I was the head of the president's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service, as well as Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which came to replace the KGB, Ivanov was appointed its deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become the president of Russia after Putin’s second term, as the third term for Putin would contradict the constitution.
However, this post was taken by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency just three and a half years later.
Star of the series "Think Like a Criminal" Thomas Gibson fired after a fight with producer
Gibson was a part of the stunt at the Los Angeles show last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, made an apology on Thursday, before it was announced that he would be removed.
There were creative disagreements in the footage and disagreements in the opinions.
I'm sorry this happened," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson’s character will be removed from the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to arrive later, according to statements from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in sitcom Darma and Greg, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
“I love ‘Think Like a Criminal’ and have put my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but now it will be impossible.
I just want to thank writers, producers, actors, our wonderful team, and, most importantly, the best fans the show could have ever dreamed of.
The show is scheduled to return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mysteries: Fish landed in Banfa Garden
A man from Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could have been sands left by a water squid.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted a shot of this sighting in Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Quinsferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the northern spring and the viaduct of Quinsferry Crossing – which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four junctions between the "sheet weirs" that are now approaching completion near all three pillars of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters in length and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 watts of bridge.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Quinsferry Crossing.
We all witnessed engineering art on a truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel were used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the termination of the junction between the viaduct and the bridge sheet is a virtuoso operation using extremely accurate clearances for assembly.
In total, about 79% of the entire bridge sheet is now in place, for the last section of the sheet, concrete coating is poured into the Rosyite today, which means that the whole sheet is ready to rise to the place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project director of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure on each bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this closure is one of the most modern construction art.
After installing the last section of the road map and connecting it with the expanding road map of the North Pillar, we had to close the remaining gap on the north side – or facing the coast.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters southerly.
It was a large-scale and at the same time a very fine operation.
It is large, because the 222-metre-long viaduct weighs about 6000 tons and was to be raised at a slope angle of about 3%.
It’s great because the tolerances that the team worked on were tiny – just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Rescue in Moelfr Bay: Three men 'must have stayed alive'
The three men were forced to stay alive after being thrown out of a fishing boat in England.
Rescue station Moelfre RNLI raised alarm at 13:20 British summer time on Friday, after the team saw an incident unfolding in Moelfr Bay.
Three men tried to make it to a safe place while their ship continued to go on its course.
“We saw their ship circling next to them and assumed the worst,” said Moelfre’s lifeguard, Vince Jones.
“Fortunately, by the time we came down to the water, a strong wind carried it away from them,” he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing vessel, and a third man, 60 years old, was found disabled and trapped in a storm without a life jacket.
All of them were taken aboard the shore rescue hatch and delivered to the rescue station.
Jones said: “The three men who were thrown into the water were lucky to be alive and completely harmless.
The boat's engine had an emergency switch, but it somehow disconnected from the man who was driving the boat when she woke up.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy pursuit of health and happiness
It’s interesting to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time watching screens, has been a complaint of many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people off the couch and engages in some physical activity.
Time on the screen was initially limited by television, then video games and more recently by smartphones.
So great to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the full-blown fascination that is Pokémon Go, an application based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (later spawning a series of cartoons, game cards, and other distractions).
Like many other pop-culture phenomena, all of this has lost its former relevance a little earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries at the time was delayed due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In a matter of days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, smartphone players are going to look for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and, being detected, can be ‘photographed’ (through a screenshot on your phone) or ‘captured’.
The generation that played the game, when they were younger, joined an intense passion, separating themselves from the sofas to look for.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the “ordinary” person on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of people tracked who performed 30-minute exercises daily jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who is playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data about passing levels.
Many health campaigns that convince people to "find 30 minutes", "get off the couch" and "be active every day" have not found the answer, because most health messages are boring and spoken by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes, and an even long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it pulls people out to do what they love.
Thus, three fundamentals of health are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring jobs that are looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone can knock on the door.
Well, what's that?
The breakthrough happened.
After all, even though apps for smartphones such as Fitbit might have been able to track our physical activity before, they didn’t give us a reason to do as this game gives us.
The novelty will come, and the use will weaken over time.
However, due to the success of Pokemon, more games will appear that will combine apps and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simona Byls wins gold of absolute championship in women's gymnastics
Forget about the pressure.
Forget about the sumatoch.
Simone Bayles is invincible for all of this.
Dynamic on the back of the jump.
Unforced on the chin.
Impressive on the floor.
Surprising everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of absolute championship champion on Thursday, placing a gap between himself and the rest of the world at a convincing demonstration under close Olympic spotlight.
Her total score of 62,198 was at a sufficient distance from the silver medalist and teammate of the "Final Five" Eli Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Alia Mustafina.
Bayles from the United States performs at the gymnastics rink during the final of the women's individual absolute gymnastics championship at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bayles became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the absolute championship title and the fifth overall, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps at any time.
She was torn when her final overall score was shown and her long journey to that point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as the extremely rare athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their sports to new heights:
Balls has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 World Championships medals – including 10 golds – with such stunning programs in their mix of hard work and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lutton called her “the greatest ever.”
One last test was expected in Brazil, a competition not so much between the Bayles and the others in this field as between her and the load of over expectations.
Anything less than going back to his family’s house in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be seen as an unwarranted expectation.
Simona Byls from the United States, left, and Eli Riceman hug after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the women's individual absolute gymnastics championship at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bayles earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of retiring national team coordinator Martha Carroll.
While Bayles insisted that she had never looked to the future during her long journey to the top, it was not quite so.
Part of her free practice program — which includes her signature passage — is set on Latin American music, which would fit right into the street like a house on the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, enchanted by her grandfather and grandmother, as she began to walk as a child and was discovered by coach Amy Burman's mother during a visit to the gym, where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She hasn’t lost a single race in an absolute championship since the summer of 2013 – a streak of luck that should last as long as Bayles wants.
Despite the fact that Mustafina received a small advantage with the help of two turns, it was a mirage.
Gymnastics brawl and free practice – where the Bulls defend the title of world champion – lie at the base.
She came out again with 15,433 on the track and finished with 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman gently embraced her while they were waiting for the final bill—pure formality—and tears appeared around a brilliant red with a white and blue lining to the eyes of the Byls when the design she once recorded on the album for cutting was realized.
Raisman's performance was a small place in the four years since she shared third place but lost bronze to Mustafina on a tie break.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, whom the Americans call “grandmother,” was far ahead.
She sent out a crowd kiss after her free exercise covered by a return, which at times seemed to be in question.
As for the Bayles, the viral tweet of the 19-year-old since the beginning of this week now has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the deadliest attack in the case of Phoenix’s first serial killer over the past decade, sat in the car, spoke and listened to music when they were shot, according to police reports, published in the press release.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Alice's daughter, Malia, were shot on June 12, when their car was parked on the driveway, authorities said.
The criminal made about eight shots from the gun, standing on the passenger side of the car, after which he hid on another vehicle, according to the report.
Police say the triple murder is apparently not the result of the robbery, as the perpetrator did not take the purse or $2,900 at the disposal of one of the adult victims.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sgt. Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to check whether it was linked to the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others wounded as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas over four months.
“This is happening in a residential area in front of the house,” Howard KPHO, a CBS affiliate, said earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including the brown Nissan of the late 1990s, black BMW of the late 1990s, and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked to each other and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and his daughter Ellis, Malia, were killed on the spot.
The witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shelling, which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and which is believed to have been the hands of a serial killer.
Investigators found the gills and pulled the bullet out of the seat and fragments of the bullet out of the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old child with microcephaly: "Becomes better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys, and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly — the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pixivto did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was — I couldn’t do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign it.
Which, in fact, is not true – of course you subscribe to it,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even offered to put it in a specialized medical facility.
“My first response was, ‘I didn’t think people were still doing that,’” Pixivto explained.
Edmund's going with the walkers.
Edmund didn’t sit down or cry until he was three years old, and he still doesn’t speak.
But it is slowly going through some stages.
He walks with a foreign help and rides a bicycle.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows a gesture that Edmund devised for "please sing to me."
“We’re learning his sign language,” Pixivto told CBS News.
But it’s not just the ordinary language of gestures – she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur due to a variety of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It is still too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Pixivto recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
Did I always say what would happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn’t actually ask for a lifetime forecast because I don’t expect anyone to really be able to tell me.
But Pixivto has encouraging advice for mothers of children with birth defects because of Zika.
It's getting better.
You know that everything will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding are the cause of rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi.
Heavy rain and large-scale flooding in Louisiana have forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state by Saturday, including.
Many rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi have come out of the shores and are threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service said.
Louisiana Gov. John Bell Edwards said state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and the aid had already gone to the affected incomes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor’s office for national security and preparedness for emergencies, said transport requests for high water, boats and sandbags were received.
Steele said that only the arrival of Tangipahoa asked for tens of thousands of bags of sand.
The danger of flooding remains in effect until Saturday in most of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that additional 3-5 inches could penetrate the area.
In southern Alabama, the duty to wait for the flood was in effect until Friday, as rain continued to go to the Mobila area.
The Comet River near Baton Rouge and the Aimet River near Springs Day, both in Louisiana, were forecast to set a flood-level record last weekend.
The synoptic Alex Krautmann said that both rivers could drown many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flooding going down the stream at the Assenchen inlet is a threat, as these swollen rivers will slowly leak into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest ever recorded level at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of the flooding in the Emmit and Wilkinson counties of southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were among those rescued early on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says the waters of Beaver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said another baby boy, who lives nearby, warned him.
“We woke up and the water kept coming,” Hansford said.
She reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford it was the biggest flood she had seen in 48 years that she lived here.
Hansford said he and all members of his family had a disability, and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued all three with the help of an army truck and delivered them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding is "rapidly spreading" as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported a 13.75-inch drop of rain from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was oversaturated by rain from the environment.
Heavy rain and street flooding have led to work to rescue residents from homes at the entrance to Tangipahoa and cancel classes in five school districts, authorities say.
WWL, a CBS affiliate, reports that an adviser to Tangipahoa told about 200 flooded homes.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but they are both now warming up.
The arrival president, Robbie Miller, said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets in the high water.
The shelters were opened in the city of Aimet and the city of Hammond to accommodate those who had been evacuated.
“They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water starts to recede,” he said.
In the city of Hammond, about two dozen streets were closed due to high levels of water, and sandbags were available to give to residents in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
“The last major flood we had was in March,” city manager Lacey Landrum said.
It’s on its way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey said the heavy rain continued to go to the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Tousson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Aimee, lives in the area for 40 years.
"I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before," said Tauson, "and it is still floating on the ground."
Mahesh Brown, 6, "killed by bullets", remains alive after shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a second shot at a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandmother and grandfather identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandmother and grandfather say Brown received numerous gunshot wounds, including his smell, leg, hand, and stomach, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He was badly beaten, his little body was cut off by bullets," said his grandmother, Delores Melendez, of the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is listed in the hospital in critical condition and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station that it was expected to be repaired.
He had to go to first class at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
It is reported that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; two other victims were registered in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could have been shot.
Investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a shootout between several armed men.
The shells of semi-automatic weapons, attributed to different examples of semi-automatic weapons, have exhausted the place of action.
I think it was definitely a long battle.
There were guilds on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Therefore, apparently, there were several armed fighters there and they were actively involved in the shooting,” — said the Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi.
Many homes and cars in the area were also damaged.
No arrests have been made, and police are reportedly looking at the surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was struck in the hand by a stray bullet Tuesday when she played outside her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why We Need Simon, Gabby, and Lori
That's what I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team and for several reasons.
First, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And secondly, three gymnasts: Simona Bayles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Lory" Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, who have already inspired so many black girls, play a key role in this collection.
The composition of this ensemble, complemented by Eli Riceman, who is Jewish, and Madison Cohen, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, at last, like America.
It also strengthened the black and Latin American female presence at the top of this type of sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast was an African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabby were No. 1 and No. 2.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed him warmly.
Now the world could witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Bayles, Douglas and Lori Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez performing unexpected but nevertheless virtuoso gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women's individual absolute championship.
And teammate Eli Riceman earned the silver.
We’re witnessing the peak of this kind of sport, but it doesn’t look that way in gymnastics sections around the country.
Simona, Gabby and Lori all chose the same path as Eli and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the "final five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year of Marty Carroll's training.
But in reality, gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnastics is first trained in private gymnastics clubs, supported by parents, paying the cost of training, equipment, travel, form, salaries for participation in competitions and swimming.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their workouts, and this is a costly and long-term obligation for gymnast families.
Amy Burman, coach of Simone Bayles, and Maggie Hanni, coach of Lori Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, both trained their athletes from the moment they were accepted for gymnastics.
We must create a more affordable and affordable gymnastics education for communities of countless young girls inspired by Simona, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnastics fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics classes located in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young boys (mainly black and Latino) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality youth gymnastics that deserves the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to strenuous work, discipline and persistence for the mind.
This combination has a positive impact on good health, success at school and work throughout your life.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and it is wonderful.
Playing sports is so important, especially for girls.
Now is such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simona, Eli, Lori, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of “Women’s Power” in winning the Olympic gold team and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Younger doctors have taken over the announcement of further strikes after rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to an amended agreement with the heads of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the deal, saying the NHS was on “no land” and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first junior doctors were transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in work activities at night and weekends to improve out-of-hours service.
Dr. Ellen McCoitt, chairman of the BMA’s Young Physicians Committee, said in a statement last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and that it cannot be applied to everyone.”
There are only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors will be transferred to the new contract, progress is needed, and time is on the way out.
The WMA's attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with unwillingness to take action and sometimes with complete silence by the government.
And it's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
“Jeremiah Hantu needs to act now, encourage introduction, and respond to the concerns of younger doctors.
If he does not do so, then the younger doctors are in no doubt that they are ready to organize subsequent strikes.
The last strike in late April brought a delay of about 13,000 planned surgeries and 100,000 nurse receptions, while nurses and consultants were drawn in to ensure the replacement of doctors on the picket line.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing a modified contract with the heads of the British Medical Association.
The VMA wants a better pay-off for the weekends for 54,000 junior doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged younger doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said: “The seizures achieve little or nothing, but put pressure on those already working at the forefront of the team and service, and cause anxiety, physical pain and discomfort to patients, sitters and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken with the Committee of Young Physicians and, together with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of caregivers and corporate information policies.
The workers hoped that the continued positive support on other important topics of the work of the Ministry of Education and Education, such as the distribution of staff, flexibility of training, additional training for those returning after a career break, the cost of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic recreation and recreation.
The drug for <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to take the drug for <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day, after authorities recommended giving it to more people and for a longer period of time.
The anti-inflammatory drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or a new attack.
The National Health Service of the UK’s NICE Supervisory Service has advised people to give it to people for four years to further rule out the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, now the NICE National Health Service has advised people to give it for four years in order to further rule out the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs with approximately 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fatty material on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque breaks into parts, it can cause a thrombosis that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the thrombus moves, it will be able to move along the blood stream and block the blood to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already suffered one attack are at a greater risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk by making the drums less likely.
The NICE instruction project, published today, recommends that people give 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the presence of effective secondary prevention methods, about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke occurs.”
The fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Prior to recommending ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are ready to use it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited after three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment longer than this period.
The culture of possession of the PC allows the falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim areas to flourish
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption, serving as the thrust of the government's report
The culture of political correctness has led to the closing of the eyes, which has turned into a widespread falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim communities, according to information from the government's devastating report published today.
A former member of the Cabinet of Ministers, Sir Eric Pickles, has clashed with critics of the police, city election watchdogs, and city administration for ignoring evidence of election violations due to “excessive sensitivity to racial affiliation and religion.”
The former secretary of local communities, now the anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so strong that the police needed to be allowed to set boundaries outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take IDs to prove who they are when they vote.
At the moment, voters only have to indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests putting unwashed ink on people’s fingers when they give up their ballots, in order to rule out that someone could vote twice.
It is necessary to provide better protection to the informants, said Sir Eric.
It calls on the press to give greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is done not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of a voting scandal in Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special court examining election issues ruled that the incumbent Mayor Luftur Rahman should have been removed from office in connection with a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman “ cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and forced his critics to silence, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, as it has been said, "led his campaign based on the fact that it was the duty of the Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes called into question or were the result of a person’s personality when a person votes, representing someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud with a mail vote in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made a few recommendations for cleaning up the voting system, including the requirement to bring your ID to prove who you are.
“There was evidence of pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and youth, to vote on the will of seniors, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin,” the report said.
“There was concern that... the state institutions closed their eyes to such behavior because of excessive sensitivity to ‘political correctness’ about ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including removing political activists from working with postal ballots to stop "vote harvesting."
The report, in consideration of Theresa May, also calls for tighter check-ups upon registration to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration fraud and privileges.
The option is considered to require voters to present a certificate of identity prior to the vote.
Use non-washable ink on people’s fingers as soon as they drop their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on people’s nationality to make sure they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year restriction on applications for automatic mail voting.
Eliminate political campaigners and activists from working with full-time ballots and envelopes with postal ballots.
Give the police the authority to set boundaries around the polling stations.
To amend the law in order to facilitate the presentation of charges against people in intimidation according to the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to take pictures at polling stations.
To make a requirement that only English be used in polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Enhancing training to ensure that staff members are forced to go to the booth one by one.
Sir Eric is furiously attacking the city police, saying it was "shocking" that no criminal charges had been filed after the Tower Hamlet case.
"The court, considering the election issues, disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corruption and illegal actions," he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of a reasonable doubt – a criminal standard of proof – on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful “checks for the gallbladder” of the electoral registration departments of the city administrations.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court order in Tower Hamlet was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Going crazy on a bicycle analogy, Kate and the other famous duos of the Olympics in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went crazy about French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prevo, who turned out to be impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic Games participant is far from the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, who can boast of her own famous pair — at least, according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the celebrities that appear on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians with more than superficial resemblance to the Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: A member of the U.S. men's team of snipers, Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to the Kate duo on the bike path, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain lens could be the twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the U.S. men's team of snipers, Brady Ellison, became the cause of a hurricane on Twitter after images of him appearing frighteningly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star.
And in fact, the apprentice learned about the madness of social media and admitted that he had heard that he had been like Leo since he was a child.
“I personally don’t see a huge resemblance, maybe except for the vegetation on the face,” said Brady Huffington Post.
“He’s an attractive guy, so I think it’s a compliment.”
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly point out even more this year: the striking similarity between the British jumper Greg Razerford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alia Mustafina, with her big expressive eyes, is said to be an exact copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of the South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burg was compared with the star of Hora Matthew Morrison for many years.
Moving on to the more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is a "sports version" of the actor "Start"
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who may boast similar heavy beards and lips.
Silver medallist swimmer Yulia Efimov from Russia can boast not only the same burnt skin and light hair as actress AnnaLynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the US team, according to fans, is similar to the "sports version of Lehva J.
Cruel Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, right, have the same face and eye shapes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others also saw similarities
Creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of this pair.
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to publicize his excitement that “the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
In fact, American football star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar face and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Lynne, as well as the gold medal won by gymnast Gabby Douglas, who can boast of her own beautiful wide smile, which is a smile on a smile.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Analysis of Byron McDonald's fourth place at the finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanghan on a women's relay freestyle 4x200 m excited CBC viewers on Wednesday in the live broadcast of the Olympics
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “started out like a smell” and “died like a pig” during a swim.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final women's relay 4x200 m freestyle.
It was possible to hear how McDonald, who was drawn to the CBC’s team of commentators to “dilute her color,” said: “This 14-year-old Chinese girl threw the ball, baby.”
She was too excited, started out like a smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Janhan missed the second stage of the relay in 1:57.79 – 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Cancer, allowing the Canadians to eliminate the withdrawal from China.
Audiences across Canada reacted quickly to the network after they were shocked by the tone and expressions used.
Emmet McFarlane tweeted: “In fact, the CBC dictator just said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer ‘died like a pig’???
This idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
About Ai Yanghan from China in the final of the women's relay 4x200 m freestyle said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl threw the ball, baby."
Criticism on Twitter immediately hit on Byron McDonald, with many calling for him to be fired.
Twitter users did not hesitate when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradiz, wrote: 'Nothing to yourself #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly after, Scott Russell, who led the CBC broadcast, apologised in a live broadcast for McDonald’s comment, saying: “We apologize for the comment on the swim performance that got on the air.”
It was a bad choice of words, and we’re sorry it happened.”
The U.S. Air Force ended by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement.
A friend of commentator Scott Russell had to apologize to McDonald's.
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald’s comments.
The TV also rushed to apologize and to publish the statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to air.
Last night we acted expeditiously to apologize to our viewers on live TV and our subscribers on social media.
We made it clear that Byron’s comments referred to the speech of the swimmer, not to her as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday, MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to clarify his comment, saying he did not think his words were interpreted as an attack on the person.
“I would like to take the moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women’s relay,” he said on the CBC Olympic broadcast.
“I was talking about swimming, not about it in person.”
“It goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I’m very sorry.”
The Primark buyer insulted a woman who unresponsively tried underwear in the middle of the store
Buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman got naked to try panties on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Worse, she tried what she looked like in them, rocked them, and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually moved four pairs of underwear to the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkstone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkston, where the woman tried knitting pants before putting them back on the shelf
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after a sample of underwear, the mysterious woman “dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.”
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the hall, she took a pair of panties from the window, took off her own panties and panties and put them on.
“She didn’t try to find a modest place to do it — she just stood there, uninvited.”
“Everyone got up when she took off her panties again, and she obviously didn’t like them because she put them back on the shelf.”
She did the same thing with three other couples before finally deciding that there is nothing here that she would like, dressed up and went out again.
“It doesn’t seem like she cared about who was watching her, or that she was thinking about the person who would eventually buy those panties that she tried.”
The 33-year-old Jenny Davidson from Kent said: “It’s hard to think that someone is going to take home the panties that someone else has already worn and they haven’t been posted.”
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these items of clothing from the sale after she left – well, the better.”
“I wouldn’t want to come home with a new pair of women’s panties and find that another woman put on and took them off and they weren’t posted.”
Primark said: “Primark is aware of the incident that took place at our store in Folkstone on Tuesday, August 9.
All of the goods we are talking about have been removed from the sale.
How to protect yourself from attacks with a gun using cow dung
The world around you is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Ron Mizrachi, a master of the Federation of Witch Cows in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether they come to you in front or behind, this video will show you how to beat a robber with his own weapon.
If they come from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing you need to do is to turn around so that you can see the attacker and 'liberate the line of fire'.
Then you firmly squeeze the gun between your forearm and shoulder, before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
Then the knee follows in the smell, and as long as the attacker bends from the pain, you roll the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with a gun and go back, holding the weapon against him.
For an armed, suitable front, the method of execution is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab a gun and twist it so that the villains can not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the gun and hit the attacking fist in the chest, then pull the gun out of its grip, before going back and aiming at it.
Does it sound complicated?
Watch the video to see how the Mizrachi are doing.
But keep in mind that the safest way out of any robbery — if you’re not a master of magic cow — is to give your cash.
For the guide, the traveler Jan Wright spends his language in the dirtiest places in Europe
The British traveler has subjected his immune system and ribbed reflex to a serious test, licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The leading author of travel books, Jan Wright, 51, from Saffolka, held a language on the euro note, a Peril of Circus Piccadilly, a washing button on the train, and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which was to become a film called “Lizun Traveler’s Guide to the Inner Force,” gave some amazing results.
The idea of licking a wash button on a train that thousands of others use can be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and medical staff about the increase in gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing from the sliced one brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for his gut strength tests, traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From public washes on the stations to the washing button of the toilet, this task undoubtedly tested its immune system.
In the film he made, he said, “Since I was a child, I’ve been completely carefree about my health and I’ve put a lot of different things in my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.”
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused to do was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test smear demonstrated the value of a luminometer exceeding 4000 units.
For comparison: just washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick, after the value of his luminometer was more than 4,000 units, while just washed hands show less than 60
Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio have filmed a film about a traveler called "The Inside Force Traveler's Guide", which shows the number of bacteria in different places, for example in the toilet.
In the film, he said, “It’s close to one of the worst things I smelled in the toilet.”
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's annoying.
The “Lizun Traveller’s Guide to Internal Power” was taken together with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains acid-lactose bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human intestinal bacteria and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice President Valio for breakfasts, juices and new categories Nico Voorenmaa said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended up with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it’s linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we were able to present consumers with more information about it in an interesting form.
I also think that the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the film’s director, added: “Let’s say that I would have lost respect for Jan if he had leaked some of the things I asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.”
Of course, some things were easier for Yanu to lick, and some were quite hard.
I’m glad that some of these injuries we managed to shoot on film.”
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria exclusively to a good state of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they consume, at least occasionally, products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
The family of the hooligans destroyed Saltash, the town hall of Cornwall, on the eve of the eviction
The family of hooligans left their municipal home with losses of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000, after they were evicted for scaring their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were driven out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked officials of the housing and construction cooperatives found the property in a condition that required repair.
The walls were left with sweeping holes, the halves were opened, the dirt was scattered on the floor and the walls were packed with graffiti.
The family is now resettled and is expected to live in a private apartment
Donna McEvoy, a resident of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid he would not be saved.
She said: “It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like that.
There are a lot of things to consider because this property is likely to be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family enjoys a bad reputation, and their name enjoys a bad reputation.
The couple have three sons who have lived in the property from time to time, and the police report that the kingdom of terror caused by the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, and drug trafficking.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house, which can be torn down, found an old garbage
Sex records in a house where drugs were sold in the past have been destroyed.
Neighbors say they saw the fighting on the street and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after they were granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary travel.
The eviction was greeted with relief by neighbors who said their lives had been turned into an actual hell.
One said, 'They didn't care about anyone.'
We’ve lived with them for 20 years, and it’s always been bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they've finally left, everything's gonna be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the head of the neighborhood security group Cornwall Housing, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and for that they regularly called the police.
The trash and old toys were scattered below the crowded side of the municipal house
He added: “It’s a shame that the landlord couldn’t accept any responsibility for the behavior of her and her family, as eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have been appalling to her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done to provide us with information.
I hope that this development will give a little comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that social behavior will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they all had just over 20 at the time.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Deployment workers will now have to remove the trunks of garbage that surrounds the house
In 2014, the police set up a search in the house and found more than 70 g of hemp, as well as weights, corresponding belongings and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after he found himself guilty of possession of Class B drugs for the purpose of delivery.
She said the money went to pay for the funeral for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After making them homeless, there are reports that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were packed with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they will try to evict tenants who are not subject to the rules of renting a room
Angela Crowe, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said the move sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
"This is a message for those who feel they can behave without the accusations of the prosecutor, as well as for those who are harmed by such behavior," she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be allowed by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal came in terror when a low-flying military plane barely touched the beach
In the city of Aviaru in Portugal, tourists who love to sunbathe, were terrified for their lives
The P-3C Orion Air Force of Portugal flew unbelievably low
The Air Force reported that he had performed a training flight, but insisted on the lack of security risk.
This is the moment when frightened tourists start to panic, while the moment when a low-flying plane was squeezing over an overcrowded beach.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane flying almost at a distance from hunters on the sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Resters jumped on their feet as soon as they became concerned for obvious reasons about the noise of the aircraft’s engines, but were unable to see what was moving toward them through the clouds.
The incident took place last night near the town of Aviaru in Ko<0xC5><0xA1>ta-Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few vacationers who posted a shocking video of the flight on social media, said: “He flew quite low twice, and there was a moment when it seemed at some point that it would break down.”
Nuno Arrozha added: “I was surfing and I swear, there was such a feeling that the plane would fall on me right now.”
Tourists on the beach of Aviaru were horrified when the plane appeared out of the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft performed a training flight in order to detect fishing vessels off the coast, and was forced to descend so low, as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot said the plane flew slightly lower than usual due to insufficient visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the military air force insisted that no one was in danger.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal, and also killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the circumstances – thick fog and smog from forest fires, which worsened visibility.
The aircraft performed a training flight, and the pilot was tasked with detecting fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HASSP system has been mandatory for the general public for more than a year, but most of the cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
The checks are becoming more active, and the business is facing fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system - risk analysis and critical control points - is mandatory for use by food manufacturers and carriers, as well as companies in the field of general industry in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (TEU).
The Rospotrebnadzor business checks on compliance with these standards in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far officials are imposing fines only for individual violations of the regulation (see "List of documents"...).
Failure to comply with the regulation in general will cost the enterprise 600,000 rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HASSP as a system that takes risks into account when working with foods and prevents them, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about the safety of food for astronauts.
Now the system is used in all food businesses not only in the US, but also in Canada, and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASP has been operating in the territory of TS.
The development and implementation of the system for the business was 4 years (the requirement of HASSP appeared in the technical regulation of the TSI in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials themselves admit that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the norm applies only to food production, not to restaurants, explained the head of the Public Council Elena Tsereteli.
Now everyone is trying to make up the lost.
The expected period of renewal of charter flights to Turkey - the end of August - the beginning of September.
But they will not cause a huge demand, as their target audience – families with children – is already preparing for school, experts note.
The alliance of travel agencies sent a letter to the government yesterday with a request to authorize charters already now.
"For many Russian tourists, the issue of choosing a quality and affordable sea vacation is inescapable, because on resorts of Krasnodar region and the Republic of Crimea most accommodation facilities are already booked until the end of September," - noted the authors of the letter and the svetsyrksytsyk, which emphasize that on the resorts of the Krasnodar region and the Republic of Crimea, most of the accommodation is already booked until the end of September", - the authors of the sveztsvezt.
According to the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Tourist Industry Union (RST), if the Russian and Turkish aviation agencies agree quickly, resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding of when the charters will be renewed, so far, it depends, first of all, on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes can fly in September, even August, if tour operators will quickly build programs and agree with airlines on the necessary in the direction of the flights,” said Pavel Rumiantsev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Federation.
According to him, the possible renewal of charters is good news, but it will not affect the deployment of forces in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or vacationing in other countries.
In the barhat season, tours are mainly purchased by solo travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously,” says Pavel Rumiantsev.
“Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it will now give very budget offers – 50-60 thousand rubles per tour for two, because there are people who are purposefully waiting for very cheap tours,” says Valeria Rosental, General Director of the travel agency Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, it is definitely not worth counting on the ride - the main mass of travel is already planned.
Pavel Rumiantsev also believes that since there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be required, but the excitement is not worth waiting for.
“For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal for the next season,” says Pavel Rumiantsev.
“The opening of charters in Turkey is positive news for the next season,” – agrees Valeria Rubtsov.
The tax code provides for exemption from the NDFL established by the legislation of compensation payments within the approved rules related to compensation for damage caused by the evening or other health damage.
The issue to workers engaged in work with harmful working conditions, milk according to established norms is provided for in article 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
At the same time, the norms and conditions of issuance are established by the order of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation dated 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, the free supply of milk or other equivalent food products is made to workers on days of actual employment at work with harmful working conditions, due to the presence in the workplace of harmful factors of production.
On the basis of these norms, the FNS of Russia in the letter under review 2009 came to the conclusion that on the basis of paragraph 2 of Article 217 of the NK of the Russian Federation, the income in the form of the value of milk issued to the workers on the working days of the actual employment of the workers is exempt from the taxation of the NDFL.
Moscow’s Gazstroybank has been without a license from the Central Bank.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license to carry out banking operations at the credit organization Joint Commercial Bank "GAZSTROYBANK", registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, JSC "GAZSTROIBANK" conducted a high-profile credit policy related to the placement of money in low-quality assets.
Adequate assessment of accepted risks at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank's assets led to the emergence of credit organization grounds for the implementation of measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in the conduct of dubious transit operations.
In the bank, a temporary administration is appointed for the period of validity until the date of appointment in the tender manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization in accordance with federal laws are suspended.
JSC "GAZSTROYBANK" is a participant of the deposit insurance system.
Recall that the payment of insurance compensation to depositors of the bank, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ "On the insurance of deposits of individuals in banks of the Russian Federation" is provided for in the amount of 100% of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million rubles from the purchase.
Payments, according to the Agency for Deposit Insurance, will begin no later than August 26, 2016.
According to the report, according to the amount of assets of JSC AKB "GAZSTROYBANK" on August 1, 2016 took 335 place in the banking system of the Russian Federation.
London Schoolgirl Who Joined ISIS Died in Syria <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Qadiza Sultan, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, is reported to have died in Syria.
Tasnim Akunji, a lawyer, said her family had learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have died from a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the country’s grouping unit, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultane was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
“One can only hope that the only advantage of all of this is that it’s like burying and willing others, that it’s precisely the risks we’re talking about when we travel to the war zone – to convince people to ever make the same choice,” Akungji said.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other East London schoolgirls boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan’s family said she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reed says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the post of Supreme Court Justice in the event of an election
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reed says he is confident that a Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrill Garland to the Supreme Court if elected as president.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland's approval, and how President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The head of the majority group in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, says the next president will choose the man who can replace the last Supreme Court judge, Antonin Scalia.
Reed said at a conference call on Thursday that he predicted Clinton would choose Harland "with some degree of confidence."
Representative Reid later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether she would move Garland, and simply built up assumptions.
He praised Garland and said Clinton’s team would not want to “run the boat” with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reed said Republicans who block Garland's nomination were "admitters" and "advantages" of a Republican candidate for President Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for office.
Treats states that erotic calendars for 'women as well as for men'
The magazine Treats collaborates with photographer David Bellmer to release the 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of naked celebrities, they are set to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with naked museums.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a large number of nude models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is too.
“We need to go back to the demonstration of an eternal and classic nude figure where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a woman’s body,” Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
The Moskvits will be given the memories of unscrupulous online stores.
In Moscow, they are going to release a memorial that will tell you how not to become a victim of an online store.
This was reported in Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that specialists of the department are preparing a memorial that will help citizens to choose the right online store and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this brochure provides for several sections.
These will be general information and legislative basis, rules of delivery of goods, ways of protecting their legal rights.
The application will be given recommendations on how to make the claim correctly and so on," - said in Rospotrebnadzor.
The memory for the moment is being worked out.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the website of Rospotrebnadzor in Moscow, it is also planned to release a printed version and distribute it to the Muscovites.
The Russian Foreign Ministry published a statement in which it named the name of the second suspect in the organization of a diversion in the Crimea.
Persons from among the citizens of Ukraine and Russia who have assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts have been detained.
Among them are Panov Evgeny Aleksandrovich and Zakhtei Andrei Romanovich.
"All of them are giving grateful testimony," the message said.

The FAS fines Google for 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google in the amount of 438 million rubles, according to the agency’s website.
“The fine for Google for violating antitrust laws amounted to 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine in the near future,” said Alexey Dotsenko, deputy head of FAS.
In the course of the investigation, the FAS found that Google supplies the manufacturers of smartphones, which are sold on the territory of Russia, the Google Play app store only provided that other apps of the corporation will be installed on the device.
Among these applications is also a search system, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates Article 10 (1) of the FZ "On Protection of Competition" (abuse of the dominant position).
We are confident that compliance with the regulation will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive impact on our consumers.
The Law “On Protection of Competition” should be observed by all companies whose products are delivered to the territory of the Russian Federation, and transnational corporations including”, – said Elena Zaeva, Head of the Office of Communications and Information Technology Management of the Russian FAS.
The agency suspects in the conspiracy of 16 Russian stores.

The New Book Stores network has been fined for selling the book "50 days before my suicide", the Moscow City News Agency reports.
According to the Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be considered “provocative or motivating to suicidal behavior of children and adolescents”.
The Ostankinsky District Court confirmed the violation of the established requirements of dissemination among children of information products and decided to impose a penalty in the form of a fine with the confiscation of 49 copies of printed products, arrested by the management of Rospotrebnadzor.
A source in the New Book confirmed that it was about the work of Stacey Kramer.
In March of this year it was reported that in the largest bookstores in Moscow there are checks on the availability of the book "50 days before my suicide".

The final consumer of vinyl: who actually buys the records?
Single middle-aged men love vinyl.
And as long as you haven’t been able to block the comment section with rude insults under the pseudonym NeVseVseSolitaryMenMediumLet, this statement is derived from the actual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the resurgence of records discussed is due not to a boom among the generation of two thousand who want to penetrate a new material subject, but to the nostalgia of the middle ages.
Those who recently bought the vinyl album c a large proportion of the probability are between the ages of 45 and 54, according to data.
Moreover, those who belong to the age group 18-24 years are the least likely.
It’s also not just an act of gathering lovers – it has an emotional significance: older wine buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk down the center of the bustling Soho Street, in a modest gray suit and violently gesturing before the stop, holding hands and saying something impressive like, "Let's do this."
All right, let's see.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm and dirt – hotels, cafes, Paperchase stores have now looted buildings once occupied by independent vendors – several music stores with fantastic specialists still remain.
I’d probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene where I’m close to different people in some of these stores and try to gauge their age and emotional mood by watching.
A native of Glasgow Stewart, 55 years old, who I followed from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably over 20 years old), in London, to pass the
He's a collector, I ask?
“I think so,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, pictured above (he sent me a picture by e-mail, I did not chase him home), go along the lines along the walls of his living room.
His reason for buying such a huge number of albums and singles comes partly from his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn’t afford when they were just out, and buy items he sold when he was young and on the shelf.
"A lot of what I'm buying is the late '60s, early '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are most likely introverts who like their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
That's my disadvantage.
Wes, 25, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets correspond to his YouGov profile.
He, however, noticed a new wave of people under the influence of the noise in the media, people who heard about the return and felt a duty to redeem their old records.
Judging by the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy compact discs are now selling their compact discs to buy out their records,” he says.
This may explain the boom among vinyl revivalists of a certain age.
And what about the supposed emotional importance of the plates?
It is enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to understand that record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Weas, some older customers, in particular, are offended by the cashless payment system.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may feel a shock from the digital world and prefer to move away to the constant familiar envelopes for records, items that evoke memories of a ruthless youth.
“I think sometimes it can be filling the void or having material things as a kind of consolation,” Wes says.
Since I am a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it too.
It’s a simple way to get your head on.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the record store.
The ICM poll in April showed that nearly 50 percent of people who bought the vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a loser they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl don’t have a record loser.
At this stage of news reporting, I would probably have looked seriously confused, protruding the stall with Bosanov’s collections.
“The trophy” aspect of the revival is what Johnny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men).
“Someone came in recently and said, ‘I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it in a shelf,’” he says.
It’s not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
There are more products, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older, they have a little less than twenty, who only get to know this.
Fopp, who has now taken off almost the entire vinyl floor, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples who in their 70s, tourists who photograph, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less unobtrusive than in the aforementioned stores — the last synth and sexy-pop Wild Beast, not jazz improvisation, breaks through the columns — it’s nice to see diversity in their customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but a painful psychological injury is difficult to establish existed 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleanor, 27, walked on Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records available for sale.
She looks at the goods, not spends money.
She doesn’t earn much, according to her, so collecting records is not a very suitable option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of vinyl is ...", - she plunges into dreams with breath, full of love.
I don’t know how to explain it – it’s really unique.
My last stop is the store, which is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Fashionistas.
While I’m creating the illusion that I’m looking at the jeans-enhancing shorts, I’m watching a group of teenage girls gather around the Polaroid camera every minute before the father and his daughter start discussing the Cros player’s purchase.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is arranged by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Flitwood Mac: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory records for any medium collection.
No one is looking - perhaps because they are just decorations, some are located so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "artistic vinyl."
But given that any drawing of attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and send several customers into the depths of the Soho for a while, there’s almost nothing to complain about.
It is not surprising that a layer of the population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is that layer that spends most of the money on luxury items such as vinyl.
But as long as my findings show that YouGov’s results are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they do not rule out the existence of a huge number of women collectors and vinyl fans that exist in reality, in record stores and online forums.
These people are probably working at all in the school or office.
But they obviously don’t spend Thursday morning walking through record stores on Berwick Street, sipping records and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake leader who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland's polar shark is the longest-living vertebrate — video report
Scientists claim that Greenland’s polar shark has the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nilsen, who studies these sharks, says the record was set by a female between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects proposal to drop shops in Jungle refugee camp <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The French court has rejected a proposal by the authorities to remove dozens of self-catering shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In court hearings this week, the authorities of Kale said that the state should be able to drop a total of 72 self-made shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to cut or sell tea for 50 cents apiece or <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>40 apiece.
The Kale Prefecture said that these places should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, stating that the free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They stated that self-catering shops and restaurants often provide blood and free food to those who need it.
Lilly’s court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling people running 72 self-made shops, but said the problems of Kale prefecture “were fully understood.”
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that baccalaureates, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than just feeding people who “live in extremely shady conditions.”
He said the spaces provided peaceful meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was under threat of snore was the Jungle Book children's cafe at the camp, which works for no benefit and offers 200 lunches a day, a lesson in English and French and advice on providing shelter for hundreds of vulnerable people.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect children’s cafes.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not older than eight years.”
Two charities, Aid to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that the number in the Jungle Camp had risen and exceeded 9,000 people — the highest in history — after a sharp increase in newcomers over the summer.
The libraries of the microregions invite young libertarians to educational programs.
This week, the branch libraries will hold meetings dedicated to the Day of the City, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of Physical Culture.
The programs are aimed at the children’s audience, so most of them will be in play form.
Today, August 10, branch library No. 2, in the bay microregion, invites you to the cruise presentation "My little town".
August 11th in the branch library No. 1 will be held the Kraevedche time "I live in this city, I know this city".
In the branch library No. 2 on the same day will be held a multimedia lesson "The Land of the Past."
And in the branch library No. 4 in Surazhevka - the game program "Film, film, film".
On Sunday, August 14th, for the boys from the northern microregion of the library branch No. 3 will hold the game program "Physcult-hello!".
Britain stops on silver in rugby 7, after Fiji's master class allows them to take gold
The impressive British series in the Regbi-7 was rigged at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday evening, when they were completely defeated 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
The Fijians gave a masterclass in ball possession, handing out, abstentions, game support, line running, and brute force to win gold – their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor a relief in the form of silver – Britain’s third in a day – and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tournament on the Regbi-7, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on the way.
The Boks' sick beating, 7-5 in the semi-finals earlier in the same day, could return to negatively impact them in the final.
But, no matter what, Fiji has won in such a way that a team of 15 people can’t be better.
This may be some consolation for Britain – but probably not – that at least one British will hang a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
It was a journey for the UK.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game to the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
These blows will cause pain, but progress is amazing.
Fiji started out great for fun by repelling the UK's attempts to intercept the ball.
It was like bumping into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Ossea Collinsau dived into the corner.
Having four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuvay added another tachdown on the right flank, which was implemented.
12-0 and the United Kingdom barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant attempt at intercepting the man-mountain Leon Nakaravu kept him from hitting the third, but it only delayed Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jass Veremalua made a tachdown in the right corner, and the United Kingdom lost 17-0.
Nacarava added another one after the replay and there were still more minutes ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then broke through a few more loose attempts to intercept the UK and by storm took the line to get a point.
Implementation led to a 29-0 break.
It seemed as if Fiji were born to play in the rugby sevens, while the UK still has the craft.
Which is largely the case.
The United Kingdom made a massive replacement for half of the game, and they jammed the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which by first half standards was good until Joshua Tuisov passed after several brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton made an attempt for Britain by making the tachdown in the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game long went the way of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waving flags and dancing on the stands.
It was impossible not to admire the full joy of Fiji’s approach.
Matt William decorated the Fijian cake, which did not need to be decorated, another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced, and Britain fell to the grass, completely defeated.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in their semi-finals, and the United Kingdom slightly surpassed South Africa in the tense semi-finals of one attempt at each – the difference of the British realisation.
Kyle Brown takes the Boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton with some great footwork broke the line and struck under the beams in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt at interception from Marcus Watson, England's 15th-seeded brother, Anthony, secured a victory — and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to win in a steep battle with cancer by coach
There will be no more exciting gold in these games, and that says something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy ascents in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional significance of their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who drew the weight, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always while they were aiming for the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sport to reach such a height.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th undefeated performance, again unprecedented.
What we see, the two brilliant athletes, sliding on the surface with the elegance of the swans, do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind each gold was a battalion of ready-made hands, contributing to gradually increasing victories that mattered, and there were no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would survive the day to see it.
Like he said, it was a dangerous business.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your outlook a bit for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky that he could start treatment in early 2014 in the off-season, keeping the schedule gap minimal if it could be the right expression in circumstances like these.
I needed the payment, so I had to fix it quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the ward — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said there were enough steps.
That's how it starts.
The border itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
The next moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, captain of an artillery regiment with a service in Afghanistan behind her shoulders, said: "I was emotionally broken this week, maybe it's a little bit too much, but it means so much."
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin too.
It was a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so thank you very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
This pair sets a tense rhythm to which their competitors could never match.
Even at the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were very much in the phase.
Helen said, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is very important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn’t try to do something amazing.
We weren’t waiting for the fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to get well and get out and win this race, which we did.
It will take a couple of years to decide their future.
Glover is due to be at the wedding next month, on her own with television adventure seeker Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was the Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel so much better,” she said.
The Government has extended the period for the destruction of sanctions products
The government has extended until the end of 2017 the period of destruction of food products banned for import into Russia.
The corresponding decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, it was published on the official portal of legal information.
The embargo on countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban has been repeatedly extended, now it is in force until December 31, 2017.
It is prohibited to import certain types of agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, European Union countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein into Russia.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
The elimination of food imported into the country in the circumvention of the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
Only for the first quarter of 2016 about 100 tons of banned products were removed from the sale.
The hunt for the "ban"
On Friday, rain and thunderstorms are expected in Moscow.
Atmospheric front will pass through the capital region, which will bring precipitation and lower the air temperature.
During the day, the air warms up to 25 degrees of heat.
So, on the night of Saturday in Moscow places will be short-term rain, possible thunderstorms and wind gusts up to 15 m/s.
The day is expected rain with thunderstorms and wind gusts up to 12-17 m/s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also forecast in the Orlov, Kursk and Voronezh regions, reports "Dni.ru".
The next week’s rain is unlikely.
The WTO panel of arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil are contrary to the rules of the organization.
Import rates exceed the obligations assumed by Russia when entering the WTO.
“This is the first time that the WTO has taken a decision against Russia,” the organization’s official website said in a statement.
However, the arbiters stressed in their conclusion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia’s measures were “systematic” or “comprehensive in nature.”
Russia, in turn, promised in the near future to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators.
This is stated in the report of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to appeal to the World Trade Organization for the actions of Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the U.S. conduct in resolving contentious issues at the WTO undermines the principles of discussion adopted in the organization.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members for refusing to approve South Korean judge Chan Son Hwa for the second term.
In this regard, Russia will not appeal to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against Russia.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 for the liberalization of international trade.
It now has 162 countries.
Russia joined it in the year 2012.
The President's Administration Has Changed
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed the head of his own administration, former deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Vino.
Vladimir Putin has made changes to the president’s administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, during the meeting, Anton Weino said that he considered the important anti-corruption work that began to be carried out as the head of the administration of President Ivanov and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation with the resignation of Sergey Ivanov as head of the administration transparent and understandable and the relocation of nothing will fundamentally change the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the leader, who worked in the administration of the president for a fairly long time, effectively built up the activities of the AP.
Instead came the deputy head of the administration Anton Weino - a person who knows the specifics of this work very well.
In Poland, it is assumed that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The state-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years the supply of gas from the Russian Federation may become unattractive to it due to reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the vice-president of the Polish financial company Boguslav Ma<0xC5><0xBE>ec.
His words are from TASS.
“It may happen that we are not going to buy gas at all [at Gazprom], we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main areas of supply for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway,” said Mazets.
Gazprom is currently in a dominant position in the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas, which is 30% above the 2015 level.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG purchases increased to 49.8% compared to 40% a year earlier.
Recall that on July 22, the antimonopoly agency of Poland did not agree to the creation of a joint venture of Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline.
At the same time, a month earlier, Poland left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic meters of gas to Nord Stream-2.
This was stated by the Deputy Chairman of the Board of Holding Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the power of "Nord stream-2" will be held in 2017, and in the autumn of 2016 it is planned to hold an auction on its layout.
At the end of May it was reported that Gazprom does not yet plan to take any action in connection with the intentions of the Polish side to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, said the deputy chairman of the board of the company Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, the Poles only increased by 42% purchases of gas from the Russian Federation.
Zampred “Gazprom” added that the very fact of submitting the Polish PGNIG application to the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not mean the termination of the negotiations yet.
Earlier, the Polish company appealed to the court to achieve a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
Recall, the Polish government’s authority on gas and energy infrastructure Petro Naimsky said that the Polish authorities decided not to extend the contract with Gazprom for gas supply.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish government’s authority on gas and energy infrastructure, Petro Naimsky, said his country could abandon the supply of blue fuel from the east in six years’ time.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
"North Stream-2" provides for the construction of two strands of sea gas pipeline with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine’s border with Crimea.
This was reported by the first deputy head of the SMM in Ukraine Alexander Hug.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, responding to a question from journalists, reports RIA Novosti.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, incidents affecting security are not recorded there.
Observers tracked what was happening at three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
The network showed a video of a passenger plane Yak-42 landing at Ufa airport, which ran outside the runway for 400 m and crashed on the left wing.
The video was published by the TV channel "360".
The meeting took place at 4.30 a.m. Moscow time.
The flight of the airline "KrasAvia" arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place where there were no casualties.
Only the aircraft was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport operates in the usual mode.
The Volga Investigative Directorate for Transport of the SCRC has been working on finding out the reason for the hard landing of the airliner.
The United Nations is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN special commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All sides of the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Stefan de Mistura considers the fact to be indisputable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of the inter-Syrian negotiations, which are due to begin in late August in Geneva.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about the use of toxic gas, presumably chlorine, appeared on August 2.
At the time, the opposition said that in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the previous day, the aircraft dropped bombs with a poisonous substance, but in Moscow these accusations were called a throw-in.
Later, the Ministry of Defense of Russia accused the "Harakat Nur ad-Din al-Zinki" opposition group.
It soon became known that the loaded toxic gas bombs were two.
This was confirmed by the BBC as one of the victims.
“A few minutes later I felt the smell of gas, started to burn my eyes, it became difficult to breathe,” the witness said.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be assessed as a war crime.
U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura told reporters: “The evidence that this really happened is a lot.”
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is enshrined in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).
Despite the fact that all sides of the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of the use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that the shelling of its districts is carried out daily, and the terrorists are obstructing the evacuation of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN is waiting for Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in military action.
The three-hour day-to-day comfort regime in the organization is deemed “insufficient to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped.”
Staffan de Mistura’s humanitarian adviser, Jan Egelann, said that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required to deliver relief and evacuation to the city of the sick and wounded each week.
"We have to send bulk cargoes with column trucks to the area where the roads are practically destroyed, and those that remain are mined," Mr. Egelann said. - But the Russian delegation confirmed its readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table.
Consultations in Geneva between U.S. and Russian representatives on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” continue.
How Russia opened the “humanitarian windows” in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia announced on August 11 the introduction of a three-hour cease-fire regime, which will act daily starting Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is designed to provide the conditions for delivery to the city of medicines, food and items of first necessity.
The decision of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation was made against the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow with the requirement to reverse the military operation and to contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process.
Four people were killed as a result of a series of explosions at resorts in Thailand.
Several explosions broke out in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people were killed and 19 wounded as a result of the attack.
The epicenter of the explosions came to the city of Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four states, Russians are not among them.
The responsibility for the incident has not yet been taken by any of the terrorist groups, but the country’s Interior Ministry has hastened to state that the Islamists are not involved.
Several people have been arrested on suspicion of organizing the explosions.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the scale and features of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the leading military country.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the Phuket area and Hua Hin City, Trang and Surat-Tani.
After the military junta came to power in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people visited the country, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, said police Colonel Krishna Patanacharoen.
It is too early to talk about the goals, he added, but the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs “is confident that they are not related to international extremist groups.”
“It’s too early to draw conclusions,” Mr Patanacharoen said.
But we know for sure that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, they are actually local diversions, and we are trying to establish the identities of those behind them.
The explosions occurred on the birthday of the Queen of Thailand Sikrit.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its main priorities, so the incident is most likely directed against it.
According to police general Sithicha Srisopacharoenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely with a difference of half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on bustling streets, filled with diners in restaurants by tourists.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who traded street food.
The identities of the other victims are not yet known, but they are known to be residents of four foreign states.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them four German citizens, three Dutch subjects, two Italian citizens and a citizen of Austria.
The Russians are not among the victims of the explosions, the Rosturism press service said.
Local experts also link the explosions to the August 7 referendum, in which 61.4% of the country’s population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a commission to draft a constitution designated by the military junta.
Voters had to determine whether they supported a system in which the upper house of parliament was fully appointed by the military and played a significant role in the election of the country’s prime minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
On May 22, 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the country’s army commander Prayut Chan-Ocha.
To this step, he said, the army was driven by an ongoing political crisis and a lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council of Peace and Order, introduced a commando clock and censorship, overthrew the protestors and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok Turned Out to be in an Emergency
The Thai government, led by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat, announced in January 2014 the introduction of an emergency situation in Bangkok and adjacent to the capital of the provinces.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
There were two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, in the center of Bangkok, near the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place, there were two explosions, which injured 28 people, five of them in critical condition.
The explosions occurred on unknown motorcycles.
The authorities strengthened security measures in the capital and attracted military forces to protect the demonstrators.
In the dry log, conditions began to develop.
As the “I” became known, the government was asked to agree on the draft conditions of the auction on the dry log goldfield with the preservation of two key restrictions.
The auction is proposed not to allow companies where 25% and more belong to foreigners, and those applicants whose capital will not be at least 25% of the shareholding.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players do not risk taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August, and will be held in October.
The Ministry of Nature introduced to the government the draft order and the conditions of the auction for the largest undeveloped gold and silver field in Russia Dry Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), two sources familiar with the situation told I.
The project was launched on Wednesday evening, one of them said.
In the Ministry of Nature confirmed "E" that the project was submitted to the government.
A representative of the curating sub-use of Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin told "I" that the project has not yet entered the apparatus of the official.
"The auction can be announced as early as August, immediately after the government's order is issued, and given the deadline for collecting applications from potential participants (at least 45 days) the tender can be held as early as October," - said the Ministry of Nature.
According to the "I" data, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, as outlined in the option, which was sent to the ministries and FOIWs in July (there is an "I" in the "I").
The first is the presence in the capital of the applicants at least 25% of the state share.
The second is the refusal to access the auction for companies controlled by foreign investors, based on the FZ-57’s understanding of foreign investment in strategic societies.
According to the two articles mentioned in the draft FZ, as already written by "I" on August 2, the auction may not allow companies whose beneficiaries (25% of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, as the Dry Log refers to federally-valued subsoil (stocks over 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Nature confirmed that the project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies”, but refused to comment on the details before the government order.
The demand for public participation in the capital of the participants of the auction was presented by the Irkutsk region, said in December 2015 "I" in the Ministry of Nature and later confirmed the governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor Sergey Inkoen Ero<0xC5><0xA1>te
Who lobbied the restriction on the admission of foreigners, the interlocutors of the "I" do not specify.
“But it’s in the spirit of time: not to give control in the largest gold field in Russia against the background of Western sanctions,” says the interviewer “E”, familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Nature Sergey Donskoy said on August 1 that foreigners "may go to the consortium" if the applicants attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners".
The "I" interlocutors believe it is unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for the Dry Log in the industry is considered a consortium of the largest gold producer of the Russian PJSC "Polus", under the control of the son of Suleiman Kerimov Saydu, and "Rostekha".
According to "E", in July, the partners created the SP "SL Gold", where "Polus" has 51% shares, the structure of "Rosteha" RT-GR - 49%.
In Rostec, they declined to comment, in Poluse, said that "of course, they are interested in this asset" and have all the necessary competences and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the conditions," the statement added.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision by the Russian government, said the sources "<0xD0><0x95>".
The possibility of participation in the development of the Dry Logo was stated by Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, developing assets in Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to the "<0xC3><0xAA>", are not interested in the asset.
In December 2015, the head of the Union of Gold Industry of the Russian Federation Sergey Kashuba estimated the "I" investment in Dry Log at $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants fear not only the volume of investments, but also the complexity of the project: serious exploration of stocks and technology of working with complex ores is needed, the “I” interlocutors in the industry explain.
In the pension market started the largest deal M&A - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" launched the process of merging four controlled NPFs.
As a result, on the basis of the "Gas Fund Pension Accumulations" will be created NPF with the volume of accumulations of about 373 billion rubles.
About the launch of the procedure of the merger of four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Promografo Fund", "Heritage" and "Gazfund Pension funds" - yesterday the owner of 100% of the funds of JSC "KIT Finance Pension Administrator".
“The reorganization is carried out in agreement with the Central Bank in compliance with the requirement not to deteriorate the conditions of existing contracts,” the company said in a statement.
The merger is carried out on the basis of the "Gas Fund Pension Savings".
As noted by the Director General of this NPF, Oleg Byaloshitsky, the combination of funds allows to solve several tasks: expanding the geography of presence, concentration of resources for development, reducing costs, dissemination of best practices of each of the funds and optimization of corporate governance.
According to him, the indicative period of completion of consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of NPF "Gazfund Pension Accumulations" will become the largest player in the OPS market.
According to the data of March 31, the amount of pension accumulations of the combined funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As follows from the report on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owners - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through the controlled LLC owns 65%) and NPF "Gazfond" (35%).
However, only the merger of the group launched much later competitors.
Thus, the control group O1 NPF "Future" absorbed "Stalfond" at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this combined NPF joins the funds “Uralsib” and “Russian Standard”.
“Combination into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural problems,” Nikolay Sidorov, the director general of the NPF “Future” said.
Active work on the consolidation of funds has been going on since April in the pension group "Safmar" - NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Region Fund" should enter the NPF "Safmar" until the end of this year.
In 2017 NPF "Doverie" will join them.
“The pooling of funds will have the effect of strengthening control over risks, operational processes and expenses,” the Safmar pension group said.
A break in the combination of funds, which was endured by the "KIT Finance Pension Administrator", may be caused by several reasons, experts say.
Until recently, NPFs could not afford more than 40% of the volume of issuance of infrastructure bonds, which the group was actively placed in.
After amendments to the Central Bank’s decision in March of this year on a number of issuers meeting the regulator’s requirements, such restrictions no longer exist.
If necessary, the whole issue can be purchased by one major player,” Yuriy Nogin, director of the rating group of the AKRA financial institutions, said.
Several NPF leaders in the top 15 for assets are calling the separation of spheres of influence and, as a result, staff appointments in a single fund that were to be agreed upon by the group's owners.
Yesterday Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comment.
The request of "E" in the NPF "Gazfund" was also not answered.
Although the consolidation of funds is a labor-intensive and inexpensive event, this decision will be justified in the long run.
As the CEO of the consulting company "Pension Partner" Sergey Okolesnov notes, Gazfond Pension Accumulations has fewer outflows, the accession will allow to stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, a more successful experience of NPF "KIT Finance" and "Promogrofonda" will be required in building retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of a more modern software.
The requirements of the Central Bank for NPF processes and personnel are constantly growing, so to double the infrastructure on four funds under a single investment policy is not appropriate, according to Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director for Corporate Ratings "Expert RA"
"The effect of the reduction of doubling functions will unequivocally cover the possible costs of unification," - noted Mr. Mitrofanov.
The cost of the association of four funds Sergey Okolesnov estimates at 30-50 million rubles.
“The expenditures for the maintenance of four funds of this size amount to about 400 million rubles. per year, with consolidation in the medium term, the budget is really to be reduced in double”, – is assured Mr. Okolesnov.
The best Disney movie “Pit and his dragon” was released in the Russian rental.
New Zealand’s beautiful species, a dying dragon, soulful history, and country-style songs are enough to re-believe in old-fashioned magic, according to Elena Kravsun.
The frightened baby picked up a dragon, which became a human child and a gentle nanny, and a devoted friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honor of the puppy from the book of fairy tales, plays with him in the chase and falls asleep in a coma.
Six years later, he, who grew up and in a garland, can no longer be distinguished from the other fictional forest sorceress, Maugley.
In this form, Pete discovers the red-haired woman-hero Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while Gavin's brigade (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively plowing the forest.
Now she will not only have to believe in the existence of the dragon, but also help him save it.
Pete goes through an accelerated course of “being human” in an environment of idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, a moral code in their heart, and smile more blindly than in any commercial.
No character looks or acts too terrible for the viewer to truly begin to hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who has opened up a hunt for an unusual inhabitant of his own forests, is far from an unresolved villain.
The huge puffy dragon also turned out to be quite scary, with a good bulldog's muzzle, airliner's wingspan and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon is fun to chew, chew, even chew and, fortunately, does not say, but he wants to smooth it all the time, thus it is beneficially different from all known cinematographic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of holding on provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most tense moments, not only small spectators, but also adults, begin to cry in three streams.
Amazingly good and young Ox Figley in the role of Pete, breaking up between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtuosoly gives out a canonical grandfather who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did the director David Lowry manage to remove the fantastically cute remake of the forgotten 1977 Disney film "Dragon Pete", which ran from the nose to the tail end and was remembered only by a mix of animation and feature film, and make it the most soulful film of all time?
It's not how a miracle helped.
In his original painting, Laurie took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There were music numbers on board and most of the funny jokes.
In this good fairytale you can read the features borrowed from "Bambi", "Innoplanet" and many other cute hearts of children's paintings.
Disney Studios continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality remakes of the 21st century.
Of course, "Pit and the Dragon" is not as stunningly beautiful as the same "The Jungle Book", and there is no skilled villain in it, as Kate Blanchett turned out to be a stepmother in the new "Zolushka".
But this na<0xC3><0xAF>ve film no less successfully helps to believe in miracles and good in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys from Disney's magical castle director Laurie will receive once again - for the artistic film adaptation of the story of "Peter Pane".
Worked on Pete and his Dragon Tandem by David Laurie and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks, they embarked on an ambitious new project about a non-adult boy based on the James Barry story of the same name.
RBC journalist Aleksandr Sokolov will be charged with a new charge
Prosecutors of the RBC journalist Aleksandr Sokolov, accused in the organization of activities of the extremist structure, said that the prosecutor’s office found the shortcomings in their defense case.
The fact that the prosecutor's office made such a statement, we learned from investigators literally yesterday.
We were scheduled to participate in a court hearing on the issue of restricting access to criminal case materials, but the meeting did not take place in the end, and the investigators informed us about the submission made by the prosecutor’s office,” – said Olga Dinze, RBC’s lawyer.
She said that the prosecutor's office had indicated to investigators that there was a discrepancy between the qualifications of the case and the collected materials.
Now the investigators will have to remove the gaps in the evidence base and present a new accusation to Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CPC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinza said.
As reported by "I", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation ruled out from accusing the RBC journalist of “dissatisfaction of the political situation in the direction of instability” and “illegal overthrow of power”.
The correspondent of "Kommersantboscosport" ALEKSANDR ZILBERT lived the life of the Olympian in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian team, dined at the local table and even gave the WADA test after that.
Life here doesn't seem to freeze for a second.
Even at night.
The last starts sometimes end at midnight, after which athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, the settlement and eviction from the village are carried out without stopping, as some athletes complete their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only arrive here.
Well, already at 7:30 a.m., the heads of all Olympic delegations are pulling into one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational household issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Olympic team of Russia Igor Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house in which ours were located, consider the model - has been abandoned and put into operation.
The problem with hot water, then, sorry, with the toilets.
We fought for purity for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the clinicians began to come, but they only sprayed some substance on the floor, and everything.
They have fields, you see, some innovative ones.
Mol, you can't wash them humanly.
Let us know these fields - laminate ordinary!
In general, the clearing company's changes have been achieved and now everything is OK with that.
The Olympic village is a South Butovo, a sleeping area surrounded on one side by mountains, and on the other by an impressive stream, places flooded with water.
Well, and for reliability, there is still a two-meter iron fence along the perimeter, along which the automatics walk.
In total, up to 17,000 people can be accommodated in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings hang a huge Russian flag - this house completely dedicated to the needs of our team.
Looking at a small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems are apparently the most pressing for the domestic team.
On the registration stand hang two ads: the stamp "Please don't throw paper in the toilet!" and from the hand "Get a gift of badges.
The stand itself sinks into the bubbles.
Their cheerful blossom contrasts with the headlines of the brochures: "Memory of infectious diseases for those who go to Rio de Janeiro", "First aid in drowning, getting a foreign body in the airways, loss of consciousness", "respiratory stages"
The text inside is very encouraging.
For example, “Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent treatment.
However, not everyone expects a favorable outcome.
Of course, there is a medical center in the Russian team, which is ready at any time to provide the residents of the house with qualified assistance, including relaxing and sports massage.
In contrast to the medical center, it is actually the headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is the inspirational poster "No matter what, we will win!".
And, of course, the poems:
All the arguments are absolutely insane!
They believe only in those who fear.
Let us less, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And for an even greater upliftment of the spirit hangs the announcement: "Dear brothers and sisters!
According to the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia, Kirill’s spiritual care for athletes of the Olympic team of Russia is carried out by the proto-editor Andrei Vladimirovich Alexeiev.
You can order prayer and other requests by phone...
In general, on the territory of the village there is a Centre for Meditations and Religious rites for representatives of all denominations.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, in a privileged position - they have their own clock.
Due to the loading of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the stairs, which is recommended to use during the fire.
And in the dark there was a body lying on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping employees of the new cleaning company.
I believe that in the readiness at any time to throw in the washing of innovative sexes they decided to arrange a quiet hour directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor I was waiting for a meeting with a long-time friend - Vitali Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our batsmen, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and the European champion Jana Pavlova kindly agreed to show their rooms.
Complaining about the big bill is not about what, - shares the impressions of a well-deserved coach of Russia. - We live on two, the beds, of course, are almost worth it, but this is not critical.
Sanusel is one in four, but it is spacious.
The cabinet, of course, funny, made of fabric, confidence does not cause, but things can be laid.
"No, you're throwing up, the tea's over!" says Svetlana Kuznetsov, a tennis player I met in the main dining room.
The main one is called at least because it represents a space of 2.7 thousand square meters and is ready to accept at the same time 5 thousand visitors.
Here, 60 thousand servings per day are provided for absolutely free of charge.
The menu options are: "Best of Brazil", "Kitchen of the World", "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, pasta".
The last option, as I expected, is very popular with our volleyball players.
At the same time, let’s say, I didn’t find soups in any of the units of a giant restaurant.
- What soups? - Kuznetsov is surprised.
It's good that I've got the Chinese, the welder.
And a teapot.
But in general, so that you understand, we have even worse food on the courts.
There is something to choose from, despite the incomparable uniformity.
I personally picked a couple of crackers and fries in a tomato sauce.
Next to each dish is a table with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as with an indication of the food value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
Well, to admit it, it was edible.
I don’t even know why it’s always in the McDonald’s.
Satisfied, relaxed, it is possible to say "warm" athletes at the exit of the restaurant await our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
It is replaced by a bow - a victor, the winner of which is a t-shirt.
Provocative, you might say!
To get a gift, you need to answer at least eight out of ten questions correctly.
There are questions in Russian! - attacked me by a girl from WADA.
But I didn't attack it.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic coup, of course.
The situation has already worsened on the second question: “If I have received a notice of passing the doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control point?”
I stopped at option B: "No - I have an hour."
I lost my vigilance, so to speak.
I forgot that from WADA there is no need to wait.
All in all, you have to be immediately.
Well, in the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation has become quite critical.
I thought for some reason that if I find it difficult to follow a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and me, by the way, hard!), I can use bio-additives to get “additional nutrients to boost my performance.”
Anne is not allowed.
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is not strictly prohibited, but insistently, in several proposals it is answered.
It's not fair to play WADA!
Well, how are things, Russia? - the leading quizzes.
To retreat somewhere - behind Efimov, Isinbayev and all our unscrupulous team.
That’s why I’ve focused and won an unfortunate t-shirt from my last efforts.
Know, as they say, ours!
In a win-win mood, I was stuck in a fitness center next door.
Involved in the calculation of trainers.
He hit 250.
Surprisingly, he noted that in this pileup of running paths, no Russian athlete was found.
But maybe it's right?
Let the one who can't play be trained!
And there was a guy sitting next to us at the clinic.
In line with the occupier.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
In the polyclinic, however, as in the whole village, where there is no saliva, hangs the apparatus for the release of condoms.
There is an inspiring call on it: “Congratulations on the condom!”
Next, it remains only to twist the iron resembling the handle of the door lock, and the condom, made from the natural latex of the Amazon, is ready to fall out of the apparatus.
I took it alone, in memory.
Athletes will not get away - they have been brought in 450,000.
Just for the festive and festive time spent in the Olympic village there is a whole entertainment center.
There’s a sign beside him on every occasion, reminding him that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million per day on athletes in various ways.
The center is flooded with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey, and some strange video trainer-like devices.
What is it? - I am interested in a friend in the form of a Ukrainian team, who actively uses a wild toy.
I could, of course, just say that he doesn’t want to talk to a man in the form of a Russian team, and that’s all.
Here, by the way, by some strange accumulation of circumstances in the eyes of a guy in yellow-blue.
The most playable team, it turns out.
To get around the whole village, looking at every corner of it, it takes at least three hours.
But if you walk and do not drive on electric cars, you will also open a house of the Canadian collection with cracks at the entrance and a tent with a restroom, and a ticket office, and a laundry room, and a laundry room, and a hairdresser's, and a grocery store, and a flower shop, and a lava.
And late in the evening you, Obessilev, will sit next to an olive tree, hung with colorful ribbons in memory of those who have left this world of friends and relatives of athletes.
And you're going to be in the company of a machine that's irresistibly spraying fluid to kill insects, thinking about the eternal.
This is about the Olympic movement.
Which in this village does not stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was still breathing, watching as the Australians had barely punished the American Dream Team, real fans went to the network.
Few people know: the news that Inna Deriglazov won gold in the Rapper at the XXXI Olympic Games, I got the first.
Maybe I’m even the only Moskvich who saw how it happened – not counting those who watched the Carioca competition that night.
This can only be understood by a real fan.
Imagine this: the silent Moscow night.
The neighbors downstairs - as always at night - wake up and start angry, but very loud to yell at each other.
And threatening to move the furniture.
In the kitchen there is a crane - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
In the television schedule, nothing is understood, so just kept in control of the channel "Match", "First" and in any case "Russia" - although this is almost meaningless.
"Russia" is the homeland of repeats, the whole sport there for some reason in the records.
There, the series airs live.
The hope, of course, for the "match" - the whole evening the young man shouted in the news releases first about the big semi-finals of Deriglazov--Shanaev, then about the upcoming battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, basketball is the U.S.-Australia.
I, by the way, can't say anything bad about this decision.
The Australians were equal, the first half won at all.
They put in the place of the U.S. hostages of their own greatness.
As a result, they lost, but, as now expressed, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the previous one.
It's all good, but it's close to the fight with DiFrancis, and on the screen without change.
In an easy panic, I start to leave channels.
That's the feeling, the second time in a row, they're spinning.
All right, let's go deep into the cables.
There is no “match” on any of the themes.
And, in my opinion, the fight is about to begin.
The text and tweets of some sports websites do not suit me.
Sailing gives an unexpected, but brilliant result.
On the site "First", it turns out, there is a direct technical broadcast of all competitions that take place at this point in time.
I'm calling the ferry. I'm getting a gold medal.
Deriglazova perfectly counterattacks, moves forward through the points - and quite obviously begins to drag the time.
The Italians play almost the entire division.
Our one-point forward, just over two seconds to the end.
Di Francisca throws himself at Deriglasov, and retreats, time runs out, the Italian stabs him.
Victory!
In a few seconds, the Olympic messenger on the phone reports a fourth gold medal.
I'm the first person to see it with my own eyes.
Foolish, faithful, and participative.
The spiritual administration of Muslims (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the Plenary of the DUM obliged its imams to conduct Friday sermons only in Tatar in order to force the young Tatars to "learn their native language".
The administration says it “does not in any way violate” the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, the Kazakhs say that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60% of the natives, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves.
Imams fear that their Tatar preaching “will not reach the entire audience.”
Yesterday, the plenum of the Tatarstan Duma unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the republic only in Tatar language.
According to Tatarstan mufti Kamil Samigullin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to “learn their native language”.
“For those who say it’s ‘heavy,’ in every large mosque, we intend to organize Tatar language lessons absolutely free of charge,” Samigullin said.
He added that "the decision has already come into force" and today in all the mosques of the sermon "must be already in the Tatar language".
He recalled that the DUM of Tatarstan publishes the magazine "Shura" with typical sermons in Tatar language.
The Imam, who does not speak Tatar well enough, “may thoroughly prepare for it.”
DUM Tatarstan brings together more than a thousand revenue in all municipalities of the republic.
According to Mufti, in the areas, Friday sermons are held exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, the Russian language was used in a number of mosques before.
In particular, as the Mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaev Mosque, Zakaban and Eniler.
However, Mr. Mukhametshin stressed, the leadership sets the task of having all students possess both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no mention of any insult to the Muslim-Netatar," said Mr. Mukhamethin, explaining that the sermon itself "is not a mandatory, major part of the prayer."
At the same time, the prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, lectures and lessons in Russian will be held in the mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin said "E" that there was no serious threat of expulsion of the Tatar language from mosques.
Apart from Russian and Tatar, other languages, for example, Uzbek or Tajik, according to him, are not used in the sermons in the republic.
The DUM decision was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress (WCC).
The head of the executive committee of the VCT Rinat Zakirov said "I": "The mosques are an important part of our national life".
It would be a pity if the Tatar language had gone from this sphere.
He noted that the conduct of the sermons only in the Tatar language "the desire of the imams themselves", but in the executive committee of the VCT "consider it correct".
The imams interviewed by the “I” who conducted the sermons in Russian are ready to comply with the decision of the DUM, but believe that the parishioners will have difficulty understanding the priests.
Both the Tatars and the Russians go to the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
They will, of course, be tortured.
“It will have to be rebuilt,” says Farhat Mavletdinov, the imam of the Burnaev mosque.
According to him, the sermons in the Russian language are closer to even many Tatars, as "Russian in schools and kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere originally".
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We trust in God.
Allah will show the way out of this situation," he concluded.
But about 60% of us do not know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've been switching to Russian for four years," says imam.
He believes that in the Tatar language, the sermons will “come to a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience.”
But we will obey the decision of the plenum.
The outcome of the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
"For example, it will only be easier for me, because Tatar is my native language," Gaullin concluded.
Former FSIN Director has been put on trial
The Prosecutor’s Office of Moscow has approved an indictment on the investigated CSU of the SCR criminal case on the theft of budget funds allocated to the needs of FSIN of Russia.
The former head of the prison department Alexander Reimer and his deputy will be present before the court, which caused FSIN damage in the amount of more than 2.7 billion rubles.
The Capital Prosecutor’s Office sent a criminal case against the former Director of FSIN of Russia Alexander Reimer, his former Deputy Nikolai Kryvolakova, as well as the Director of the FGUP “Center for Information and Technical Services” of the Russian Federation.
Depending on the role and the degree of participation in the crime, they are accused of scoundrels in Moscow according to Art. 3, 285 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of official powers, causing serious consequences), Art. 4, 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of bribery, bribery, bribery).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged under Art. 1 of Art. 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the version of the SCR, in 2010-2012, these persons fraudulently stole from the state execution budget funds allocated to FSIN to provide the department with electronic monitoring systems of controlled persons, the so-called electronic bracelets.
For the theft of budget money, the participants of the group developed a scheme according to which they controlled the enterprise FGUP CITOS, with which the relevant state contracts were concluded, produced technical means of control and supervision, including "electronic bracelets", for the price, and in real estate.
Despite the fact that FGUP CITOS did not have production equipment, buildings, facilities for the placement of production facilities, allowing to create a completed cycle of production of "electronic bracelets", between him and FSIN of Russia were concluded five state contracts in the amount of more than 3.3 billion rubles.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubles were deposited in the accounts of the Samaritan branch of the FGUP, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles of cash paid was received personally by Mr. Reimer in his office from one of the accomplices, the criminal case in respect of which is allocated to a separate production.
Nikolay Kryvolakova, who was involved in the machinations, was found of unknown origin of the cartridge to the prize gun, which allowed him to present an additional charge.
In this case, the amount of which amounted to 133 volumes, FSIN filed a claim against the accused for compensation of material damage in the amount of 2.7 billion rubles.
Hakan Shukur's footballers are suspected of being involved in the coup.
The Turkish authorities issued an order to arrest a former footballer, then a member of parliament Hakan Shukur, and conducted searches at two houses of his family.
The star of Turkish football from the 1990s to the early 2000s attacking Hakan Shukur is being sought by the country’s authorities in connection with an attempted coup last month.
Ford, who finished his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an “armed terrorist group.”
It’s about the “Hizmet” movement – a society associated with the famous Turkish religious activist and opposition leader Fethullah Gulen.
It is his President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an who considers him the organizer of the attempted military coup that took place on July 15.
Fethullah Gulen lives in the United States, Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media, an order was issued today for the arrest of Hakan Shukur, the police have already conducted searches in two houses that belong to the family of a former footballer.
According to the investigation, his father was also involved in the organization of Fethullah Gulen, in addition to Hakan Shukur himself.
However, neither the former football player nor his loved ones were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
Hakan Shukur, a former football player, defended the colours of several Turkish clubs and represented the national team.
He spent most of his career at Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as English "Blackburn".
In fact, he hasn’t spent more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shukur remains Turkey’s most successful striker to date: in his assets 112 matches for the national team and 51 goals scored.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur left his deputy post because of a corruption investigation that began around Erdogan’s party and its immediate surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, on July 25, at least 42 journalists were issued arrest warrants in Turkey.
They are accused of aiding a military coup and ties with opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States.
Given the severity of the charges, media employees can wait for long prison terms – from ten years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
“I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, tickets that cost 2-3 times less than for foreign-produced films,” he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that Russian films are difficult to compete for viewers with big Hollywood tapes.
We do more than 100 paintings a year in the country, of which an average of 20-25 tapes come to screens.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with the Transformers and the Iron Man, in the promotion of which huge budgets are pumped," said the film director.
On July 1, the All-Russian Youth Educational Forum "Tavrida" began its work in Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals from various creative and humanitarian fields from all over Russia and a number of countries from near and far abroad.

The Russian copper company (RMK) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMK has taken on the modernization of one of the oldest and ecologically "dirty" enterprises in the country - the Karabash medelavyna.
The Karabash Medellin Plant was founded by an English joint stock company led by Leslie Urquart in 1910.
In Soviet times it was a significant industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually provided the vitality of the entire city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was halted, resulting in serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998, a decision was taken to resume the work of the Karabash medeplavile complex.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabakh plant - environmental.
By the early 2000s, Karabakh was already known as the zone of environmental disaster.
The situation on the Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the enterprise went under the control of the Russian copper company.
The company began to carry out a modernization of production, which began to gradually reduce the environmental burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by the Governor of Chelyabinsk region Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabashmed in the first few of July.
The head of the South Urals has called the grand changes that have taken place with the enterprise since Karabashmed moved into the RMK group.
The main event for the modernization of Karabashmedi in recent years was the construction of a new sulfuric acid store, which allows to capture up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian copper company Vsevolod Levin, the amount of investments in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of modernization of JSC "Karabashmed" is the reconstruction of the conversion.
The replacement of three converters, incinerators, gas pipelines is planned for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016 it is planned to launch a new workshop for cleaning industrial goods worth 1 billion rubles.
In turn, the amounts of taxes charged to the budget of the city of Karabash will increase.
For the entire period of implementation of the Tominsky GOK project - from the beginning of construction and until the introduction into operation of the second line - the federal penalty will receive 8.9 billion rubles.
And after the introduction of the GOK into operation, the income of taxes in the budgets of all levels can be 80.9 billion rubles.
During the year of production in the Varna region, 346.3 million rubles were listed in budgets of different levels.
And this is for the first year.
“The longer the company works successfully, the higher the amount of deductions can be,” Valery Ulanovsky added.
In the RMK, it was clarified that in 2015 the tax deductions from the Mikhailovsky GOK approximated 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of the enterprises of the RMK in the life and development of the territories of their presence is not limited to tax deductions.
The enterprises of the RMK help to repair and contain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, build cultural and entertainment facilities, improve the territory.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian copper company in Karabakh became a major renovation, and in fact - almost complete reconstruction of the kindergarten N9 per 95 pupils.
The building, built in 1960, was in a state of emergency.
Also on the territory of "RMK Arena" will be located a landscape park with artificial pond, underground and underground parking for 600 cars, cafes and sports shops.
"RMK Arena" will allow to conduct spectacular professional sports events of the international level.
But the main task of this project is to make activities of physical culture and sport in comfortable conditions available to residents of Chelyabinsk, primarily for children.

WSJ: The U.S. is considering imposing sanctions against Russia over the hacking of Democratic servers.
U.S. officials are considering the issue of imposing new sanctions against Russia in response to the Democratic Party’s server hacking, writes The Wall Street Journal citing sources.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama will have to formally accuse Russia of attacking servers or Russian-backed hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies are practically confident in Russia’s involvement in the cyberattack.
The WSJ notes that the U.S. usually prefer not to name those who carry out hacking attacks.
The exception is a 2014 breach of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, for which it was officially entrusted to the DPRK.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree simplifying the procedure for imposing sanctions on those who carry out or promote cyber-attacks.
It was originally aimed at China, but can also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process of sanctions can be lengthy, the publication writes.
Even if officials came to the conclusion that the hackers acted with the support of Russia, before making a decision to disclose the information, they would have to weigh the possible consequences.
They have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to make the tension in bilateral relations worse because of it.
Earlier it was reported that the Obama administration allows the use of sanctions against a state whose hackers have hacked the servers of the Democratic Party’s National Committee.
WikiLeaks has published an e-mail from the Democratic National Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in the breach.
In the Kremlin, such messages were called absurd.
FAS fined Google nearly half a billion rubles
The reason was a violation of competition in the mobile application market.
The anti-monopoly trial was started on the initiative of Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that have banned pre-installation of apps from other developers, in particular from Yandex.
The FAS found confirmation of these claims and found that the company abused the dominant position in the market and forced mobile device manufacturers to install along with the Google Play store other apps.
According to the results of the inspection, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, said the deputy head of the FAS Alexey Dotsenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days after the entry into force of the decree.
The FAS concluded that the law on protection of competition should be respected by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to study the solution first and only then will determine with further actions: to execute it or to challenge it.
The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service recognized the company as a breach of the competition law as early as September last year and ordered the contracts to be adjusted until December 18.
However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the department have been conducting legal proceedings.
The FAS noted that despite the fine, they are discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a world agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
Such an opinion was expressed by the leading analyst of Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine will not affect either the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2%, and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, there was an increase in the price of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); recreation and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell on clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and regular maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing conditions, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications systems; and education.
Snapchat's Anime Effect Criticizes as Caricature of Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some reviewers say it’s racially unsavory.
With the help of the "Linza" tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character to raise a picture of Roy Liechtenstein.
Lenses are rough, twisting features of tools that create more than 30 million adjusted selfies per day.
Any mistakes are quickly becoming well-known.
Snapchat’s lenses have been criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising the app’s dark-skinned face or encouraging whites as an ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered a lens this week that provided them with their hair with eyes, curved teeth, and fluffy cheeks, some critics considered it a racist caricature of Asians — the “Yellows.”
And they wondered if these repeated contradictions point to a more serious problem of the company, related to diversity.
On Wednesday, messages spread and followed outrage in reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company commented: the lens was designed as an homage to the characters of the anime, not as a caricature of Asians.
But experts who know about racism are not overheard, the lens reminded of insulting stereotypes in action.
Others have completely rejected the comparison with anime.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweets about the photos were actively shared, said the lens was “insulting and at least uncomfortable.”
She added that “it’s hard to argue with a side-by-side comparison of a very rough cartoon on Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just gelatolites, but, to the highest degree, strictly gelatolites.
Snapchat isn’t the only company going through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry with us.
And a huge audience of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diverse than their older generation — can mean that they’re more likely to expect understanding.
When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, in an interview Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said, “it’s much harder to remain unnoticed than it used to be.”
On Thursday, Joe, a product manager and engineer who works at Medium, decided to remove her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial contradictions are the cause of insufficient diversity in the recruitment of personnel in Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the company’s predominantly white management, consisting only of men, and ended her article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu, who herself is an American of Chinese origin, wrote: “They either didn’t have enough black people in the state who could make such decisions, or they have black people working, but they don’t hold positions where you can safely and openly speak.”
Other reviewers share her point of view, expressing dissatisfaction with Snapchat not answering most of her questions.
The company does not publish information about the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial origin of its staff, but according to a trusted person, the company recently hired a recruiter in order to focus on underrepresented layers of the population and on active attempts to involve domestic resources.
For her part, Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding: “I wonder if they actually need more users like us so they can say that’s not going to work.”
Military leadership has distorted intelligence on ISIS, congressional commission reports
Officials from the U.S. Central Command have altered intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the facts on the ground, the U.S. Congressional Commission said in a report.
the interim report of the operational group, established by the representatives of the state officials of the House of Representatives on the affairs of the Armed Forces, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Sub-Committee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among the analysts of the intelligence service
The Central Command, known as the Center, is the main military command in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence documents approved by the Supreme Command of Centcom, as a rule, gave a more optimistic picture of U.S. anti-terrorist actions than is confirmed by real data from the scene of events, and were more stablely optimistic than the analysis provided by the other," he said.
“What happened at the Centercom is unacceptable: when the top leadership is presented with an unreliable analysis, our military is suffering,” said House of Representatives member Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
The problems with the leadership in Centcoma reach the highest organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the misstatements that have continually emerged in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of U.S. actions aimed at training Iraq’s armed forces provided by the Central Command.
While it does not contain conclusive evidence that members of the Obama administration’s leadership have ordered the reports to be falsified, he argues that analysts felt that Centcom’s leadership forced them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State or the Islamic State as well.
“During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony from the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than real events,” the report said.
For example, a Centkom official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at returning Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
“After months of investigation, this is known for sure,” House member Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the U.S. Central Command’s top intelligence chief faked the command’s intelligence documents to reduce the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans formed an operational group when they learned that the analysts expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, according to a report published on Thursday, more detailed data will follow.
An additional, unfinished investigation of the intelligence of the Central Committee is conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee released their own data on Thursday, which agrees with some of the findings of the Republican task force.
“Between 2014 and 2015, the Center created an over-closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments on ISIS and the Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, a member of the House of Representatives, the main representative of the Democratic Party in the committee.
This procedure, according to Schiff, "has slowed down the issuance of intelligence documents", has damaged the morale of analysts and "does not adequately reflect differing views".
But Schiff and the Democrats claim that they have found no evidence that the White House has tried to force Centcom analysts to bend their findings to “targeted or political interpretation.”
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
In August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon's chief inspector, which was opened after complaints from analysts from Centcom.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report as the chief inspector's investigation continues.
But he said that "experts sometimes differ in their views on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital issues related to national security."
The implications of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing targets in Iraq and Syria are being met (as more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defense are now claiming).
But last year’s statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide truthful assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other critical points.
Criticism of the Islamic State intelligence repeats the disputes that took place more than a decade ago, when the intelligence analyst of Centcom Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper claiming that the administration of President George W. Bush did not intervene because of the protest of many Analyticists.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest caused by intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, Huker’s team came to the conclusion that despite public statements about the reverse, air strikes on oil and gas plants belonging to the Islamic State did not lead to a significant deterioration of the financial situation of the terrorist group, which was not a terrorist group.
But the discovery was not spread outside the Central Command, the Times reported in September.
The then-Centre Commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate, which many MPs considered to be an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by the Central Command of Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. wins women's hockey four times in a row on grass, thus drawing closer to a decisive battle with Britain
Having once scored three goals in a match that ended in a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam opened the account on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's hockey team on the grass, when the Americans won a 3-0 victory over India.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, 27, says she’s not sure if she’s ever done something like that.
“I’m not crazy,” she said.
I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
Here’s what she knows: Americans’ account 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for first place in their group with Britain, which remains unbeaten after losing to Japan with a score of 2-0 on Thursday.
Teams from the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams claim the quarter-finals, and the result of the game will determine who will take first place in their group of six teams, and who will be second.
The winner will avoid encounters with a strong team of rivals from the Netherlands, leaders of another group, a bit of weather when the quarterfinals will start.
However, Saturday’s game shows that the Americans here made the noise of their unexpected series, four years after they took last place among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time taking a hockey stick on the grass when she was 3 (her twin sisters played this kind of sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in the East.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she did not pass the selection tour to the finals.
Then came 2012 when everything didn’t work out with her and her teammates.
The following year, Koeig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything started to change.
“Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training,” said Bam.
In London, we didn’t have the performance we have now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the account in the first half of the game with an uncomfortable hand at a short distance.
India came to the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team showed itself to be surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative in his hands.
She made a long pass with the ball down on the left side of the field, then spiraled into the middle and abruptly sent the ball to the gate, thus giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez added a final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" win was the first in the tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's in shock.
Same as Bam.
“We’re in a good position right now,” Parnham said, but how well it depends on the outcome of Saturday’s game.
In the midst of the turmoil of the Olympic Games - "Den" jumps on the bat
No matter where you are, no matter what the weather is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem invariable and inevitable, it is a furious combination of competition and ambition.
The Olympic flame itself is the burning torch that is transmitted from the torch to the float, to the gymnast, to the triathlon.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors’ conversations in a row in the cafe and not hear about Simone Bayles, Katie Ledecki, or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad de Cloe.
And there's Logan Duley.
Dolly, for the first time participating in the Olympic Games, a beauty pageant with sticks on the cheeks, could well be among those celebrities who are shown in the prime time, promoted by sponsors and life-affirming advertising videos, if he were a swimmer or a gymnast.
But 28-year-old Duly from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold at the Olympic Batut Jumping Championships.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all events in the same way.
Further away from the center, partly in the shade, are those sports that are not generally recognized: shooting from a pneumatic gun, shooting from an onion, badminton, technovondo.
Brass will always be with us, long reigning for him.
But if I am allowed to speak up for my personal passion, allow me to draw your attention to the modest charm of the jumps on the boot.
Although batting has been an Olympic sport since 2000 when they made their debut at the Sydney Games, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many people I interviewed were unaware that they were referring to the Olympic sport at all.
This could be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won medals in batting jumps, and their athletes did not make it to the final until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians usually share men’s awards with each other, and the Chinese and the Canadians are women’s.
Dun Dun from China and Rose Maclennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But the jumps on the bat have the charm of an outsider, in particular because for an unlit ear they are more likely to be associated with a circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I have to admit that I am not an expert, but a grounded enthusiast.
They really have a comical potential — it’s a caricature of endless jumps — but also the beauty of gymnastics and jumping into the water, the two types of sports that they mostly combine.
The word "butut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampol<0xC3><0xAD>n", meaning "trumplin for jumping into the water".
Applicants for the victory jump on a giant bat, flying in the air for almost 30 feet, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends, and salto) until the final landing on their feet.
They are evaluated by performance, complexity and "flight time", according to the official program of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will meet in Rio.
The most common course of the Olympic Games is forward.
Applicants for the medal must go further, faster, higher and higher in pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forth, from there to the field.
They aim not only at the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in the eyes of the TV cameras, at another irritating border: the world or the Olympic record.
This persistent pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical – and it is enough to make even the viewer slip.
But, in my opinion, it gets a bit tired when watching the game.
The jumps on the buttocks give him a break.
The Baptist's direction is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, seems weightless, like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And in them, of course, it is not without competition or difficulties, but throughout the program there is no crazy rush to the finish, no jumps in length, only a strange, exquisite disappearance of time and gravity.
It is the closest to the Olympic sport.
Women's qualifying competitions, and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast in the hour of the day in Eastern European time; men - on Saturday, also in the hour.
NBC will broadcast the final as part of the daytime program starting at 2 p.m.
In the midst of Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can be easily seen in the general landfill.
And if consciousness growth can only be achieved by subjecting male athletes to guided views and objectification – as, according to the Wall Street Journal, recently assumed by male gymnasts from the United States – Duli is just waiting for his new fan base.
"Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, a long-time U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce opposition from the government. . . .
Witnesses say dozens of protesters were mortally wounded during clashes with police, according to the report.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of a split?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly developing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shocked the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
According to human rights defenders, the government’s reaction was brutal.
Witnesses claimed that police officers had shot dozens of unarmed protesters in the area.
Video footage from protest sites allegedly taken at the end of last year or earlier this year shows how security officers punch young people with sticks when they put their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Representative for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country from collapsing, and it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project in an international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy is developing at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly – there is even a new suburban train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly an example of democracy — human rights organizations are constantly talking about government repressions — the opposition on the territory of the state was cut off, because dissidents were actually silenced.
Many of them were sent to prison, killed, or driven into distant deserts.
But that can change.
“If people are constantly oppressed and left with no choice but to protest, there will be an uprising,” said Seyum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All the youth are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
Complaints are numerous, starting with land use, ending with the seizure of power by the government coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the government’s party and its allies have completely pushed out the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tension along the border with Eritrea is growing; the struggle for this uncertain, disputed border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use unrest and re-arm themselves.
A number of factors explain why the bitter feelings, which have been burning in the depths of the soul for several years, are now bursting.
The first, it would seem, is completely harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years has a large number of ethiopians been able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace, and internet service has become better.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter as it often happens, especially during protests, many people still find it possible to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this is how they organized themselves for the protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
The Oromo and the Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara from predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and living in low-lying areas.
But it also changes.
“We will act together at the same time,” said the leader of Oromo.
The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromo.
Many of the Amhara and Oromo feel that members of the ethnic group Tigray are unfairly dominated in Ethiopia, which makes up about 6 per cent of the population and controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts claim that he particularly skillfully recognized the first signals of dissatisfaction and used scouts to obtain data and disarm opponents.
“The current regime lacks common sense,” said Abdi, an analyst on conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalen, appeared from nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, which was native to the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Heylemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he does not trust the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that this will lead to even more bloodshed as a result.
Ethiopia last experienced such unrest in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said was apparently an election that the government closed down and then falsified the results.
During the ensuing repressions, many Protestants were killed, although in smaller numbers than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
The development experts expressed their appreciation to the leaders of Ethiopia for the long-term development of infrastructure, such as the new intercity train and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this did not stop the increase in internal discontent by the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, the city of Amharic, attacked businesses owned by Tigray, and anti-Tygrayan hatred on social media became widespread.
Analysts say the protesters are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently announced that it has closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already unstable region.
"And it will be difficult to get through this stretchy canal," Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIS was founded by Obama, a “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried to cover up the latest conflict that engulfed his pre-election headquarters on Friday, claiming he was joking when he said several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terror group Isla.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the candidate to be president from the Republican Party to address the American people sensibly.
It also put his deputies, who were trying to protect him during a period of unrest, in an awkward position, as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
Speaking at the conference on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his endorsement on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the president and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a tweet early in the morning on Friday, Trump wrote that he was just driving.
This post was the direct opposite of the claim made just a day earlier, when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When radio-conservative Hugh Huytt tried to help Trump soften his speech, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican Party presidential candidate did not take the opportunity.
The latest scandal broke when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy amid a decline in the rating.
Trump and Clinton have spoken out against competing things about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to get back to the topic.
Once again, when he turned to Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s plans would lead to an increase in taxes, and said that he thought her speech was boring.
Trump has previously used sarcasm as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he drew general criticism, practically expressing the idea that the Russian should break Clinton’s e-mail, he later explained his remarks by saying, “Of course, I’m joking.”
Such an approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permissible in political speech and take his words back if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing some of the messages that find a response among his fans, watching how they act, and then “explaining” them in one direction or another, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who conducted an analysis of the language of both candidates.
But I also think he’s careful in his statements and knows they’re loose enough to interpret them differently.
Instead of mitigating remarks for the broad electorate, Trump has taken on an even more vulnerable tone in recent days, while his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, released on Friday, showed that Trump is stepping down from Clinton with a heavy weight in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado and is going with her level in Florida.
Although Trump usually tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump has become the subject of increased attention in the last months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an awkward position: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, who is one of Trump’s most famous deputies, made serious efforts to protect the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is an acceptable political comment,” Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown small organization, he called it a non-threatening, absolutely unfair, and that's why it happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq.
The majority of the average Republicans believe that the Obama administration, in which Clinton held the office of Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to develop, as it was unable to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the media for exasperating every word he said and prejudice towards him.
He was horrified at the "poor unfortunate" television experts who were trying to unravel him, and said, "They're weak!"
Some Democrats have ridiculed Trump’s excuses as an unnecessary confirmation that he is unfit for presidents.
Once upon a time, a coffee shop was moved back to Greenpoint.
The Verb coffee shop was a bustling, cash-only place in Williamsberg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was pushed out of her room with a window on Bedford Avenue.
Shop "Soup Sherry", which took place "Verb" in the summer of 2014, is engaged in the sale of soap in the form of cakes.
The locals lamented her as the last loss in the modern city.
The artist Molly Krabaple wrote on Twitter: “New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb has now become a soap shop.”
But while New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, being updated.
The Verb coffee shop opened in November last year in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but there were some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
And the coffee is still good.
The head of the new Verba is Sisco Rodriguez, a former employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager of the new location.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the very end.
When one of the customers offered to offer it in a new place, he said he would be happy to go for it.
Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, who is 36 years old, left much in the past.
Verb works with the same beagle distributor and bought the same model of coffee machine.
It even has chandeliers from the old "Verb".
But Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu includes sandwiches with bacon, eggs and cheese, and there are toppings made of capers or roasted onions.
There's a brown rice dish.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but now freshly squeezed juices are prepared.
Nine months later Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez said he had paid attention to the constant flow of old regular customers.
“Many former customers have also been pushed out by prices from Williamsberg,” he said.
In one of the recent resurrections, Rebecca Oliver was one of such clients.
Olivier, 34, had previously lived in Williamsberg and often visited the Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still moved in there.
After Verba closed, she said she had stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized that it was coffee and the atmosphere that imponed me in Verbe,” she said.
Now she is drinking coffee again, although on that day instead of the usual ice-coffee she ordered a cup of tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosental, another longtime customer, has been devoted to Verb since 2003.
He went to work and ordered the same thing invariably.
“In the fifteen minutes of the eighth, every day, as in the hours, I came, and for me my beygel was cooked with oil and all the stuffings,” he said.
Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes to the menu.
Today, Rosental still makes an ordinary order, but one day he will change something with the help of bacon, eggs or cheese on a bagel with all the stuffing.
Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez said he was not offended by the fact that the soap shop once took over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of the Soup Sherry offered to make a special soap for Verba, using coffee from a coffee shop, prepared in a cold way, as an ingredient.
“I think we might agree with their proposal,” Rodriguez said.
The permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also loved this coffee shop.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to find a place for him in the showcase so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
There are other benefits to the new place.
The local point of sale of juices plans to pour in bottles and sell coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is a possibility that the cafe will join a neighbouring building.
For many customers it is enough that the new Verb will include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and shared that he was killed by the fire when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in a new place, Whitt said that by going inside and ordering a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
“How long have I wanted to feel this smell,” he admitted.
Depressive food of depression in the "Main Table"
In March 1933, shortly after taking office as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved the fashion dishes of Fifth Avenue, such as the fua-gra and the Maryland tortoise soup.
His menu on this day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and on dessert - pudding made of black olives.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are experts in the history of food.
Koua's latest book, "Raku in Chinese", was devoted to Chinese cuisine in America, and Zigelman told the story of life in an apartment in the Lower East Side through food in her book "House 97 on Fruit Garden Street".
Their new joint work, “The Cloth Table,” which will be published on Tuesday by Harper’s publishing house, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing some of their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny simple snack in the Flatiron Quarter, which has been operating since 1929, the year of the stock market crash.
Zigelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and a sandwich with pieces of olives, and Kou, 57, took an Indian, a potato puree and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered meat roulette, the couple considered it a suitable starting point for discussion about food in the Depression era.
“Roulettes were in great demand,” Zigelman said.
There was peanut roulette, liver roulette, bean roulette.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap foods that allowed to stretch the ingredient.
Imagine that you have eaten as much peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coo's dead.
“He was probably lying in a stone in his stomach,” he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Groups of women were preparing for farm men, and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. The "seam table" describes how the country coped with the fact that it suddenly ceased to be a country of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans,” said Kou, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Just as difficult was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes, such as roulette and baked goods, became the main food; baked goods are “a great way to eliminate meals,” Zigelman noted, “because the cook could hide the unappetizing ingredients of the dishes.
Fresh fruits have been replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for many years was the basis of American food, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange blends, because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While researching for a book that includes recipes, Zigelman prepared a dish of that era: baked onions, stuffed with peanut oil.
“This addition to the lunch table was not a success,” said Kou.
Zigelman added: “It was very strange.”
Arachis oil is not suitable for roasted onions.
This was typical of many home-cooked recipes.
As never before and never since, household specialists — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Affairs from 1923 to 1943 — ruled the country’s food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budgeters,” take on the challenge, and turn a board like discarded spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
The “clothing table” is a table of interesting historical facts.
Particularly spicy stories about the government’s reaction to starving citizens, for example, President Herbert Gower’s position in the spirit of “let the pies eat”.
Publicly transported by the simple farming band of Iowa during his childhood, he was fed as a sophisticated millionaire, which he became.
"He liked continental cuisine, for example, fish with cucumber sauce," said Kou.
He ate almost in a gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to give an example with his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economist who was completely uninterested in taste, and this led to the White House “using not only the most disgusting food in Washington, D.C., but sometimes the most disgustingly prepared.”
Many of the culinary approaches of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Zigelman, and on how science has been used in food preparation.
The couple say that while they were writing the book, they had a better understanding of Zigelman’s mother’s eating habits—that she could not throw out food, for example.
“She was seriously afraid of a careless attitude to food,” said Kou.
Zigelman recalls: “She seriously poisoned people.”
There was one unpleasant case of prophylaxis.
When the plates at Eisenberg's ran out, they and Koe got a dessert that they cooked at home: a black-and-white dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called blackberry mousse," Zigelman said, adding that it was a common recipe - to give modest recipes brooch names.
There were no crushed creams, only blackish, a little flour, sugar, water and a lid.
Everyone unwittingly swallowed the spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Unsurprisingly, it was not bad.
Cou asked for supplements twice.
With the voice of a confident budget maker, he said to his wife: “A little ruble of Greek walnuts would not interfere here.”
The arrest of the figures in the case of mass fighting in the Hovansk cemetery has been extended until November 14
The Presnensky court left until November 14 under arrest of the figures of the mass fighting case at the Hovansk cemetery, satisfying the relevant request for investigation.
There are 14 defendants in the case.
Recall that on May 14, a mass slaughter of several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus took place at the Howan Cemetery, resulting in the deaths of three people.
The former head of the cemetery Yuri Chabuev and the lawyer, co-founder of the public organization "Healthy Nation" Alexander Bocharnikov were charged in the organization of the murder.
The issue of the second pension index for 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on August 12 by the Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation Olga Holodots during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have set specific parameters on how much we need to raise the pension in order to counteract the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
Now the economists are summarizing the results of the half-year, and we will complete this work in the next two to three weeks," - quotes the Hlodets "Interfax".
Commenting on the six-year pension scheme proposed by the head of the Center for Strategic Development, Alexei Kudrin, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the Cabinet did not consider this issue.
At the end of July, it became known that the Government agreed a position on full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan went to the final of the competition for small-caliber rifle shooting.
Russian athletes Sergey Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan went to the final of the competition for shooting from a small-calibre rifle from the position of a lie at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergey Kamensky scored 629 points and took the first place - this is a new Olympic record in qualifying.
Kirill Grigoryan became the second - 628.9 was.
In total, there were eight best athletes in the final.
Kamensky is a world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gulen is calling for an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup in Turkey.
“I demand that an independent international commission conduct an investigation into the attempted coup d’état,” French newspaper Le Monde said in a statement.
The Turkish opposition leader also said that “if any part of the accusations is confirmed, I will return to Turkey.”
Gulen, however, denies any involvement in the coup d'état, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
The court in Istanbul had earlier provisionally arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen.
Recall that the attempted military coup took place in Turkey on the night of July 15-16.
Gilead Companies Will Reimbursement Legal Services Expenses During Hepatitis C Patent Dispute With Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement of costs for the legal services it has incurred in connection with the patent dispute over the hepatitis C drug with the drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc, a federal district judge has ruled.
In June, Gilead was exempted from paying $200 million in damages for the infringement of two Merck patents relating to Gilead’s medicines, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a number of violations against Merck, including a breach by Merck.
In a court hearing on Thursday, U.S. federal district court judge Beth Lebson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to reimbursement of costs incurred during the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of liver disease patients.
The case took place in 2013 when Gilead and Merck filed a lawsuit against each other, declaring their rights to the lab work based on sofosbuvir, an active ingredient of Gilead’s medicines.
The U.S.-backed armed forces claim to have taken full control of Manbij by the Islamic State.
The armed forces, created with the support of the United States, seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last remaining militants in the city of the Islamic State left, the group's representative said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now cleaning up the city after the arrival of the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city.
They liberated more than 2,000 civilian hostages who were held as militants, Sharfan Darwish, an ally of the Manbij military council, told Reuters.
“The city is now completely under our control, but we are conducting clean-up operations,” he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed that a Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mainly in the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in fees for speeches, and the former Secretary of State, Simon, declared a $3 million dollar income owed to the Clinton Foundation.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane from Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, has released tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set a financial transparency standard,” Clinton’s chief Electoral Officer Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In complete contrast to them, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and violates his past promises to make his tax returns public.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called the State Tax Service’s check as the reason for his refusal to publish his tax returns.
“Your move,” Clinton’s Jan Sams, an election advisor, wrote on Twitter, referring to the Democratic Party’s candidate’s statement.
On Thursday, Trump’s special adviser Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the checks were completed.
Trump’s critics, including a Republican presidential candidate in 2012 Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, said his refusal raises questions about his status, his charitable contributions, his business operations, and other ties, including Ross and others.
Clinton seized on the issue and released an online video on Friday, in which the main place was reserved for prominent Republicans who convinced Trump to publish a tax report.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what everyone has done without exception to the presidential candidate for decades: to make public his tax returns,” she told the gathering.
The Politico newspaper reported that Trump had paid no or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business reviewer quoted many tax lawyers and accountants on Friday as saying that things might still be the case.
Federal tax rates have been the subject of controversy in the presidential election.
Clinton backed a rule named in honor of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people earning more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, offered Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also under IRS scrutiny, and that Trump was "feared" not by the tax agency, but by voters.
The Clinton Pre-Election Office published the tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The Clintons’ 2015 statement showed that, unlike most Americans, only for $100 of their income was a source of wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index hedge fund, and the Clintons claimed a dividend and a capital income of $109,000.

Preservatives with chili powder and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania are using a non-traditional way to prevent elephants from straying into populated areas — putting in them condoms filled with chili powder.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with this idea a few years ago, together with the U.S. Committee on Conservation of Nature, took up its promotion, training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use their non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, and non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, and non-violent, non-violent, and non-violent, and non-violent, and non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-human-violent, non-violent, and non-violent, non-violent-violent-violent-violent-violent-violent-violent-violent-violent-violent-violent-violent-violent-violent-violent-violent-violent-violent-violent-human-human-human-human-human-human-human-human-human-human-human-human-human-human-human-human-human-human-human-being.
In the past, many people used spears to protect themselves.
Friday will be World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
“Since we invented a set of tools ..., we are seeing a change of attitude within these communities, as a result of which they are much more confident that they will not be able to let elephants into their fields without causing harm to elephants,” Honeyguide CEO Dahl said in a statement.
The first two steps consist in burning the torch in front of the violated elephant border and sending signals with the help of a horn.
If he can't get away with it, the so-called "chili cloud" is thrown away.
Chili powder, mixed with soil, is placed with a cotton ball in a condom, and its end is twisting, only the fillet remains outside.
When burning, the preservative is peeled with a lump, spraying a small dust of chili powder in the air.
One breath is usually enough to push the elephant to the other side.
The extreme measure is a launch device that shoots Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
So far, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey, who have left the country after the coup attempt in July this year.
Such data was quoted by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Chavushoglu in an interview with local journalists.
In the first phase, we recalled 208 staff diplomats to continue their work at the centre.
Of these, 32 people have not returned without objective reasons and explanations,” the head of the Turkish foreign policy ministry said.
Let us remember that in July there was an attempted coup d'état in Turkey.
The country’s authorities officially declared that the coup failed, and reported the detention of more than six thousand people, among them the military units of the upper and middle class.
As a result of the attempted coup, 290 people died, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
The Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel’s phone code at the “request” of Arabs, the channel RT News reported.
The French director of Jewish origin has unleashed a scandal in the media, finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin is not on Israel’s phone code list, with employees referring to “requests” from Arab customers.
Claude Lantzman, the author of the documentary about the Holocaust "The Show", expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lanceman Hotel, he tried to find Israel in the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the states, where one can call directly from the room.
How could it have happened that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of New Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
Written by Lanceman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides the opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this question on the stand of the hotel administration.
The answer he got there, according to Lanceman, "shocked him."
The hotel's clerk said the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel network."
The reason behind this move caused an even greater anger of the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the Israeli code be removed," said Lanzman, a hotel employee.
Israel’s ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadass-Handelsman called the case a “terrible disgrace,” reports Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
This is, in fact, a terrible shame.
The fact that this happened in Germany and in this network of hotels is even more shameful.
There is no need for explanations here.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” the official said.
The case caused a lot of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some have argued that Kempinski Hotel simply “got on the case” with the supposed demands of Arab customers.
"We would be ashamed," said another post, which indicated that the hotel, located on the famous Kurfurstendamm street, is near the synagogue.
The hotel itself has hastened to dismiss any charges, calling the incident "unexamined" and "apologies" to Lanceman, reports the newspaper Der Spiegel.
“There was no direct order not to include Israel in the list of fast sets,” Kempinski’s representative Suddeutsche Zeitung said in a statement.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police are using tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students.
The students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered to protest against government reforms of the state education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to dislodge the students, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public secondary schools will be closed, and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some of the participants in the protest could be seen writing on the walls of the graffiti directed against the temporary duties of President Michael Temer.
This latest protest took place just days after mass protesters took to the streets to support deposed President Dilma Rousseff when the country’s Senate voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71%, reports RT Business portal
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Jagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there is a growing interest from Russian firms in conducting business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” said Jagaryan.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved thanks to the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that this year Russia will visit a record number of Iranian tourists.
Last year, Russia’s diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries by the number of tourists visiting Russia.
We can say with confidence that last year’s record for the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which hopefully the ambassador will change.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yizd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition,” he said.
The state continues to twist the hooks in the defense-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was "systematic failure" of the General Director of the concern "Almaz - Antey", "launch in work" and "loss of confidence".
The head of the NGO for the next three years is Gennady Bendersky.
Information about the dismissal of Neskorodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause widespread resonance in the media.
How can such silence be explained in the context of a large-scale re-arming of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This once again confirms that the Defence and Industrial Complex (OPC) has a lot of problems and the state does not want to attract more attention from society.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event from the point of view of order in the industry.
NPO "Almaz" is the main enterprise of the concern, which specializes in the production of anti-missile complexes (ZRK) of sea and ground based.
At present, Almaz is working on the creation of the Poliment-Redut and Morpheus SRCs, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the portal Military Russia Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov is caused by a breakdown of the deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007, and it was planned to be launched in 2013.
"Polyment Redout" should become the main air defense system on the newest ships of the Navy.
According to the information I receive, in the course of several years of testing, no truly successful test has been performed.
However, as far as I can tell, there is no clear fault of Almaza,” Kornev said.
The expert is afraid that the delay with the introduction into operation can also occur with the S-500.
Experience-construction work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes should enter the army.
The Ministry of Defence assures that "the work is carried out on schedule and everything will be completed within the set timeframe", although in 2014 the agency acknowledged the presence of problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has led Almaz since 2011.
Kornev stated that project timelines could be both a reason and a reason for dismissal.
In his view, it has become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information about internal processes in the CSOs and enterprise management plans.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and big money is known to love silence.
As a rule, the director of defense companies leave positions at his own will, under the agreement of the parties, or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the removal took place publicly, although it did not receive a resonance.
This presupposes that the head of Almaza was perhaps a figure of stroptivity and resisted the "disorders" dropped from the top.
In any case, the state no longer intends to reconcile with such behavior.
By the hands of the shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the Ministry of Defense’s installations and do not fulfill the tasks set.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the corrupt rulers (machinery on the shipyard "Zvezda").
Increased attention is paid to the problems of the sector personally by the President.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings on re-arming.
The Kremlin protects a number of OPK managers, seeking to have a loyal composition of directors at hand, who will comply with the orders received from above.
This is a far from ideal policy, but against the background of corruption and the absence of normal competition in the OPC of other instruments in the state.
The situation in the defence, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation stimulates the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces into order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleaning” of the managers in the OPC, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to increase the professionalism of the Russian troops.
The personnel of the army acquired a new quality with the arrival of the Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu.
The impression is that the president has adopted the famous saying “Want peace – prepare for war”.
During the Cold War, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which consolidated Moscow’s sphere of influence on the continent.
With all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
The lack of war on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East proved this.
The "victory" of the Cold War ultimately resulted in the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of attacks in Europe and the United States in the "civilized world", there is probably no quiet corner left.
Despite the common problem, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such conditions, the only allies of our country remain the navy and the army.
The strengthening of military power will enable Moscow to defend national interests more effectively and to enter the new frontiers of world politics.
The Scottish Kallum Skinner raced on the finish line, as a result of which the British captured the bicycle gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to a triumph in a men's team sprint on a bicycle in Rio last night, as a result of which the UK team trio defended their title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of the strongest, which his friend Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the young man proudly entered the story, swirling in the finish line to knock out a victory for the favourite team from New Zealand.
Britain declared the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoy declared the right to a fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the March World Championships on track bikes in London, despite Hoi having since finished his career.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of participant expert Jamie Staff.
They did so just at the time of the appearance of Hindes.
Choi's departure also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crempton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was held by British coaches, seeing the potential in Scotland, which has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny — champions with Hoy four years ago — and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the norm was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hinds was right behind after his round, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
The change of strategy was a major part of the transformation, where Hinds went on a larger transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoe observed from his place as an invited expert to the BBC and took the eyes of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the pedal.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, “This is a ladder comparison.”
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
That was incredible.
There is no better way to win.
After a 2012 London triumph with Kenny and Hoy, Hinds admitted to deliberately falling on the track after a failed start.
He later declined to comment, and there was no way to appeal from UK competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hinds said, "I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the stands."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
“We’ve lost so many races with a world name that winning the Olympics was just amazing again.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country, which has won seven of the 10 named races in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then another five successful days are waiting for the biker.
With the form shown by Kenny, it’s not beyond the ability to imagine how he repeats Hoya’s feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in one Games.
This would allow you to see how Kenny — who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoya, who was also born on March 23rd (this seems to be a sacred date in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) — brings the melodies from his sixties to his count.
It would be just like Hoya's.
The next time Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and is played for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I’m just enjoying it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You're coming to win with your comrades.
It’s a bit lonely to win alone, if you’re honest.
Hindes said, “If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood.”
It was the only day to win medals, but there was good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke, and Owen Dulle qualified the fastest four-kilometer team race of four.
They finished at 3:51,943.
The world record for winning gold in London in 2012 was 3:51,659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying round, when officials demanded that he measure his weight.
In the corresponding women’s event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanne Russell Shend, Eleanor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milwaukee improved the world record by a time of 4:13,260.
The UK team has come to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to take ownership of the mid-term Olympic Games and earn a lot of medals.
After a truly exceptional demonstration of complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations weakened in the gradual preparation for Rio.
There were dramas in the background, not the last - the departure from the post of technical director Shane Satton in April due to accusations of sexism and harassment, and the departure of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, based on the race of the first evening on the bike, it seems that the legendary now fame of the UK in reaching the top at the right time may be repeated again.
The future of Portland's metallurgical plant is under threat due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminum plant in Victoria – as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers – is under threat because the electric power company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant’s owners, will cancel the supply contract, everything is planned:
This step is a consequence of the decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to extend the subsidies provided to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs – directly and indirectly – can be in the risk zone as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 percent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed a metallurgical plant at Point Henry, which led to the closure of a power plant in England last year.
Alcoa’s Portland metallurgical plant is losing money and risking closure.
These actions resulted in reflections on the future of the plant, which has been going on for several years, initially due to strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later - due to the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminum plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe-Walli, said it expects the other three owners will also take steps to terminate the contract.
The controlling share of the plant belongs to the joint short-term enterprise of Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp belong to smaller shares.
"AGL expects that the Portland facility will continue to operate, that is, that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop," she said.
According to AGL, these contracts are the so-called “hedge contracts” that were due to come into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually end in 2017.
“Accordingly, AGL is still expecting these contracts to bring its share of revenue in the 2017 financial year,” the company said in a statement.
Whatever the potential impact on AGL’s profit from the 2018 financial year is currently limited by forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its account by $187 million in the form of a “future termination”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to operate a metallurgical plant or provide electricity to a metallurgical plant.”
The U.S. company said in 2010 it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was due to come into force in November this year, but had yet to explain why it had terminated the contract.
Analysts feared a possible closure of both the Portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL chief operating officer Stephen Mickelsen said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year, and Tomago – about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
For us, as for the manufacturer, it will be bad,” he said.
Not only reality show star Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan's mother-manager Chris, appeared on the lead September cover of American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and has been on fashion shows in Milan, Paris and New York, said the news in her Instagram account on Thursday.
“While I was in the room with my favorite people, I looked at this cover and cried,” Kendall wrote.
The news about the cover was accompanied by a strange (or simply in the spirit of "The Kardashian Family"?), a classic reality-video, in which the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (deboshire Rob and Caitlin, also joined by the commonest "Kardian" show uncle.
This is a standard storyline for almost all episodes of children's television shows dedicated to their birthday (the Secret says the phrase, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the show at 8 a.m.), but Chris had to have this douche done anyway.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have undoubtedly entered a new era of the Kardashian show.
Let older sister Kendall Kim get on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is Vogue’s best-selling issue of the year.
A thickness similar to a gift edition rather than a fashion magazine, the release attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the Fashionista portal, 615 pages from last year’s 832-page edition contained advertising).
News of who will get the stars on his cover is expected to be so impatient that in the last two years the magazine's photos have merged to the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more “familiarities that work as models” on the cover than “models that are celebrities”.
The Academy Award winner and Dior brand face Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after this honor fell to Lady Gaga.
But even in the unlikely event that Jenner, whom the magazine described as its generation’s “excellent model,” falls into the first category, she’s in a bad company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality show stars, or modern kids who know how to make a good video on Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
These are really talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on last year’s cover, this year was one of the most successful in his career due to the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, due to her past star of the television reality show, should always have been a shady one.
In June, one of Victoria's Secret's first models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague, Jiji Hadid, calling them "pieces of the moment."
These moods once again faded after the news of Jenner’s appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But it doesn’t make sense to get stuck in a dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's running for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you a tonal cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their own apps, available through a paid subscription.
She sells hand-made photographs of her daughter Cindy Crawford to Love magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she participates in a reality show on television.
Public Legal Centers Refuse to Serve 160,000 People a Year
Every year, more than 160,000 of the least-protected population refuse to serve in public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for an effect that will further cut funding for and already leading to the potential for activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people who are unable to deal with unfair deprivation of property and so on — have already been refused, trying to get free legal aid and a representative.
Public legal services that are already working outside the scope of their capacity are preparing for further reductions.
As of June of next year, these legal centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Law Centers, said that according to the latest census of the National Association of Public Law Centers, thousands of people are being rejected every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government’s decision is not annulled, the situation will only get worse.
“Quinsland’s public legal centers are constantly receiving insufficient funding: this means that thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and devastating debts, families who go through divorce, unfairly fired workers – all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they can’t get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent since June 2017, meaning thousands of less-protected Queenslanders will be forced to settle complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator of Queensland George Brandis to immediately cancel these funding cuts so that people can get the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise the funding of free legal aid to the country's average.
Now is the time to pay attention to the needs of public legal centers and communities, their clients, and it is time for the government of Palashchuk to contribute to this important work.
Donald Trump’s pre-election staff were brought to court after an employee allegedly threatened with a gun
According to reports from New York City, Donald Trump’s pre-election headquarters were sued: it is alleged that the headquarters did nothing after reporting that his North Carolina chief of operations had threatened an employee with a gun while they were riding a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordini, a former instructor in software work at the state's pre-election headquarters.
Bordini said he waited several months for the problem to be resolved internally, but realized that "this will not happen".
“Director Earl Phillip pulled out a gun, put his right index finger on the thumb and sent a doll to Vincent’s knee cup,” Bordini said in a complaint.
Complaining to the local and regional management of the pre-election staff, Bordini realized that at least four more people had become participants in similar incidents with Philip, the appeal said.
"Pistols don't have to be shot to do harm," Bordini said in a complaint.
The lawsuit took place just two days after a Republican presidential candidate produced a furor, telling listeners in North Carolina that "the people of the Second Amendment" — understood as gun owners and his fans — could begin to act if his rival Kubera and Kuberna began to act.
Trump’s pre-election staff said the media had kicked his words out of context and that he did not speak out in support of the violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demanded compensation from the pre-election staff for negligent control, and from Philip for the threat of physical violence, harassment of action and causing moral damage.
The representative of Trump, Hope Hicks, is slow to respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Philip have not been successful.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, said Phillip had recently left the polling station.
In response to the calls to his consulting firm, the Innovative Consulting Services, no one quickly called back.
A presidential candidate from the Republican party, Donald Trump, ran a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Department of the Supreme Court of Mecklenburg County (Charlott).
Britain needs to send the Olympic spirit to the right track and expand Heathrow
“Hitrou will also bring rebirth and prosperity not only in our local settlements and in general in London, but also throughout the country.
It was, in my opinion, the huge advantage of Heathrow, just as it was with London in 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our peoples and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games have brought huge benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we will do it again, creating opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
Only for our local settlements, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, there will be those who think that the task of expanding the Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be in a difficult position on the world stage.
The skeptics made a mistake in 2012, and they will prove to be wrong about Hytrou.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hytrou answers any question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for a narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a wonderful team in Heathrow, which has implemented a program of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investments on time and within the budget, from T5 – chosen by the best terminal of the airport five years in a row, to T2, built in the midst of two of the most busy airports in the world.
They are now ready to provide a third runway, confirmed by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 Olympic Games in London have been a huge success for the UK, and I am confident that the expansion of the Heathrow will also be.
It’s time for us to steer the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton – Chairman of the Council of Hytrou and the former Trade Attache of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook Plays ‘Cat-Mouse’ on the Blocking of Advertising
For companies that make money on online advertising, attempts to bypass the ad-blocking software are a game in “cat-dogs,” according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post that users can update their filters in the program to block ad blockers.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site will change the bar around its ad, making it harder for ad blockers to recognize which parts of the page are an ad.
But Adblock now states that it was able to bypass the new code.
In his blog post, Adblock representative Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of mutual struggle between the community of open-source ad blockers and those who are trying to circumvent it is ongoing since the invention of ad blocking,” and it is possible that Facebook is presenting its own time.
The fact that the world’s largest social network has entered the fight is a clear sign of how big the problem has been for the advertising blockers for the industry.
Around 200 million people around the world use ad blockers, according to last year’s Pagefair and Adobe research; nearly four times as many as those who used such software in 2013.
Considering the 1.3 billion daily active users who visit Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s revenue from advertising.
However, the company is hunting for ad blockers on the desktop version, as mobile ad blockers are ineffective in Facebook’s mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
But still, the ad in the desktop version is a sufficiently profitable article so that Facebook considers such a move a profitable investment.
Facebook also announced on Thursday that it is going to update its “ad preferences” tool to give people more control over how they are targeted by advertising.
Facebook said on Thursday that the new Adblock filters are causing concern, as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
“This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem,” a Facebook representative said in an official email.
Advertising blockers are a rough tool, so we instead focused on creating tools like Ad Preferences to transfer control into people’s hands.
Woman transferred to a Swiss highway in an episode of apparent suicide <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling for witnesses after several vehicles were moved to the highway early on Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident occurred at A1 near Morge in the canton of Vo immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a gesture of desperation" and was hit by several vehicles, police said in a statement.
Apparently trying to kill himself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several involved drivers have already been questioned, but the identity of some has not yet been established, police said, calling them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was initiated, a “logical” step in such a situation, said lawyer Jill Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Is it possible to avoid hitting?
That’s what the prosecutor should determine,” Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case — both of which involve a person walking in the dark along the highway — was convicted that motorists can not expect an accidental encounter with a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reports.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payern at night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, the court heard.
The court found that a policewoman – who responded to an emergency call – was driving a vehicle in a manner that was justified, and that the presence of a person on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about the incident on Thursday near Morge should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once inhabited by humans
Venus may have been once habitable, according to estimates of the new NASA climate model.
Scientists from the NASA Institute for Space Studies Goddard developed a model for studying the past Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine whether, on Venus, with its hot water-free surface and an atmosphere oversaturated with carbon dioxide, there could ever be conditions similar to Earth’s.
Scientists have previously assumed that the small speed of Venus' rotation is due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus was likely to have a cut-off atmosphere, similar to Earth’s, and still rotate slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and enough geographic variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus was also in favor of the sun, which was 30 percent thicker.
“According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus sets its daytime side to the sun almost every two months at a time,” Anthony Del Henio, a GISS scientist, said in a press release.
This heats the planet's surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds acting as an umbrella that protects the planet's surface from a substantial part of the sun's heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which, surprisingly, are a few degrees cooler than they are today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development previously assumed by experts in the study of planets.
Despite the fact that Venus may have once been habitable, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and its water vapor was burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen evaporated, there was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy quits as Avalanche team coach
Patrick Roy left the position of coach and vice president of hockey activity Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team decision-making process.
Executive Vice President/Chief Manager of the Colorado team Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have been serving as the head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey business with energy, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
During the summer I spent a long and hard time thinking about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey activities must perfectly match the vision of the organization.
He should also have the right to vote when making decisions that affect the team’s work.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a win in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and lost the playoffs in the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced a 39-39-4 rating in the 2015-2016 season and five points behind Wild in the fight for the second qualifying round to participate in the Western Conference.
A goaltender from the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cups—two with the Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea Oilers Resume Negotiations and Stop the Strike <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Working strikes on the salaries of oil workers in the North Sea have been suspended, and all sides of the discussion are embarking on a new round of negotiations, the leading representatives of the parties said.
The attacks against the oil company Wood Group sporadically took place on platforms in the North Sea, run by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and the Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve ongoing disputes,” the joint statement said.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting at the beginning of next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
Trade unions said their recent share, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was aimed at potential wage reductions of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to the negative market tension.
The company’s rate cuts came after a 10-percent reduction in rates for contract staff working on the coast in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions will give it the space it needs to overcome the market decline.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas activities in countries of up to 10, as it rationalizes its activities as a result of its mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of falling prices for crude oil: the economic situation has deteriorated due to the decision to leave the European Union, adopted by the United Kingdom in June.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts that arose in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
“In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just for some,” he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to an average value of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers to compile the most complete catalog of the rotational speeds of stars entering the Pleiades cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how periods of rotation relate to the formation of planets.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other stellar clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the star’s mass, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said study co-author Luisa Riball, a researcher and researcher in the study.
Pleiades is located in 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now only reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they'll ever be again.
At their peak rotational speeds, these adult stars throw out large amounts of stellar wind.
While traveling through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds exert a braking effect on the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star, tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots – such as solar spots.
The latest catalog of rotational speeds suggests that more massive stars are rotating at a slower rate than less massive stars.
Fishing compares the stars to the dancers: larger ones make the pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
“In ballet, we observe that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, while those that rotate faster are usually considered to be very light stars,” Riball said.
Since the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as the perfect space laboratory to compare the properties of stars to the speed of rotation.
“The Pleiades star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both younger and older,” Riball said.
We still want to know a lot about how, where and why the stars slow down their rotation and hang their “dance shoes” on the nail, figuratively speaking.
Fisher and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades' rotational speeds in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation, related to the activities of a group of Ukrainian dissidents detained in the Crimea, is conducted by two departments, writes Kommersant.
The FSB is gathering evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of diversions in the Crimea.
As previously reported, the resident of the Ukrainian city Energodar Yevgeny Panov, agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, as objects for diversions, he considered the "Titanium" chemical plant in Armenia, the oil base in Theodosia, the Kerch ferry route, gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airports.
Law enforcement officials believe that not all sub-contractors of the divers were able to be detained.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of the suspects in the Kiev District Court of Simferopol, the publication notes.
The head coach of the Russian football team was Stanislav Cherchesov
At the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Russian Football Union, a decision was made on the appointment of the head coach of the Russian national football team Stanislav Cherchesov.
The contract with him will be for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the Russian Federation appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian football team.
He is a famous footballer who previously played in the Moscow Spartak in the position of goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was a mentor of such Russian teams as the same Spartak, "Zhemchuzhina-Sochi", "Terek", "Amkar", "Dinamo", "Terek".
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed as soon as possible and is planned for two years.
Thus, it is his responsibility to prepare the team for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Pannikov.
There is information that the salary of the entire coaching staff will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.6 billion per year.
According to the media, the leadership of the Russian Federation set before Stanislav Cherchesov the goal of bringing the Russian team to the semi-finals and winning medals.
As the coach himself stated, as a priority task, he is considering creating a competitive environment in the team and is going to give the players the opportunity to manifest themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov will be held on August 31 in Antalya - this will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Earlier, the post of head coach of the Russian football team was occupied by Leonid Slutsky, who combined it with training in the CSKA club.
He announced his departure from the post after the failed Russian national team’s performance at the Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the poor result of the team itself.
Congested between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during a long struggle against apartheid.
However, after gaining independence from South Africa in 1990, the country, with a population of 2.4 million people, has achieved tremendous success, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries see themselves as understanding free primary and secondary education, in many poorer countries, middle and even elementary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce a training fee for “reimbursement of costs”.
However, in Namibia, primary schooling is free of charge.
Moreover, since 2015 secondary education has become free as well.
The authorities of the country are also actively working in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases of the disease by 97 per cent over the past ten years.
Contrary to the international trend of growing inequality, in Namibia it is shrinking.
Compared to the 1993 indicator, the Gini coefficient, which is the standard indicator of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) also declined, from almost 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has the highest freedom of speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country fared well ahead of the United States and other rich countries.
In addition, the country has a favorable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the "Corruption Perception Index", which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now that commodity prices are falling, Namibia is able to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The level of unemployment, at least according to traditional assessment methods, remains high enough - almost 28%.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high level of HIV/AIDS - almost 17 per cent of the population is infected.
According to the World Bank, Namibia is among the countries with an above-average income, but the authorities insist that their country is actually a developing country.
Namibia, of course, faces some difficulties that are inherent in the underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
In the desert, isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherer live in the country, which in one way or another must be integrated into modern society, without loss of identity.
Integrating people who a quarter of a century ago were on the periphery of the world economy is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, it is even more difficult: just like any other country in the world, it is facing the consequences of climate change.
However, Namibia did not intend to lower its hands, the country is solving the problems facing it.
Almost immediately after gaining independence, the authorities engaged in the creation of a diversified economy and a unified society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical care not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbors.
About 15-20% of visitors to medical facilities in the northern areas of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about the construction of a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians realized that their neighbors did not choose, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to encourage investment and exchange of students.
In addition, the Government of Namibia has rightly argued that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that the revenues from Namibia’s natural resources need to be invested in infrastructure and production capacity.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum profit from the sale of the country’s resources, and review investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, so strong support from the Government for freedom of expression is so important.
As the head of state Haggai Gangob noted, the media often says what he dislikes.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it has received, the president said.
Not all of Namibia's key resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, are renewables, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious shortcomings—racism, colonialism, inequality, and low levels of development—can stand in the way of general prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the "Golden Varna" - the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
Perhaps it was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavations of the Varna Necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts were found - more than three thousand total weight 6 kilograms.
Only one grave, known as the "Mountain No. 43", was excavated with 990 gold objects weighing more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the oldest gold in the world could soon be turned into an opaque bull found by archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a pre-historic settlement known as Tell Yunaciti.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tell Yunacit is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunacit Pazardzik district.
Busina is a gold strip, turned into a ring.
Yavor Boyadzhiev, the head of the excavations at Telle Yunacite, dated to the discovery 4600 BC and stated that it is older than Varna gold for at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna, remember, date from about the same period, 4600 - 4200 BC.
Technologies that allow you to date metal with impeccable accuracy, do not currently exist.
How do you know which gold is more ancient?
Apparently, Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters: "I am absolutely sure that the gold of the Yunacs is older than the gold of Varna."
It is a finding of extreme importance: in view it is a small object, but it is large enough to occupy a suitable place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadzhiev said that in the near future, scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as again and more thoroughly study the archaeological layer where a gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bus with as much accuracy as possible.
The location also explains a lot.
The Tale of the Yunacites is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
Today, Tell Yunaci is considered to be the oldest “city” in Europe.
The Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
During the following centuries, metalworking in this region developed rapidly, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the national historiography for this archaeological community there is a special name: Balkano-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban-type settlements began to emerge around metalworking centers.
They are now known as the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yunacite is perhaps the most ancient, as the artifacts of 4900 BC were found here.
I would call Tell Yunacite a prototype of a modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“This is a place that is a thousand years older than Sumer,” Boyadzhiev says, referring to the generally accepted view that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia – modern Iraq.
It was there that the first cities emerged in the usual understanding of this word.
The excavations of Tella Yunaciti have been carried out since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists excavated nearly 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fort wall that once reached three meters in height were found.
There is little left of the houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish the streets, public buildings, the city’s dense construction, the “business center” and the residential districts.
Tell Yunac<0xC4><0xAB>t<0xC4><0xAB> is often called the "Bird City": dozens of clay figures of birds have been found here.
All the birds are depicted in a state of peace, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but an object of local cult.
The "bird town" was destroyed around 4100 BC - perhaps by Indo-European tribes coming from the north-east.
The nomads had no towns, but they had horses and weapons.
The three-foot-tall walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of a violent battle: inside the houses were found the remains of elders, women and children with traces of wounds inflicted by the battle axes.
New discoveries and new facts appear every year, changing common perceptions about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe, born in the Balkans.
A powerful stimulus in the search for this civilization was the "gold of Varna", found relatively recently, in 1972.
It is logical that the golden luxury of Varna should have preceded something - something like a tiny golden bush, created in the Tell Yunacite.
Porsche artificially obsolete the 911 Targa
It is officially stated that the preparation of the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by specialists of the unit, who work with serial machines.
Retro-onion is, for example, a special Etna Blue body color, which was developed back in 1960 for the Porsche 356B - even the model's logo is painted in this color.
In addition, the targa received signature white graphics along the boards and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel discs, as well as some body design details painted in "white-gold metallic".
In the interior of the retro-drawer is noticeably smaller: it is distinguished, in large part, by the gray-blue range of design, by new chairs with extended ranges of electrical controls and separated black anodized steel bars with the unit's logo.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a gift of a bucket for the car and a richly separated album with photos of the production process.
The power plant of specialists Porsche Exclusive do not touch: the retro-tarch according to the characteristics quite coincides with the series.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbocharged volume of 3.0 l, developing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can accelerate up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in a limited edition, but neither its volume nor the cost of each particular sports car is reported.

AdBlock Plus has released an "opposition", but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus has announced its new technology, which is likely to remain effective shortly
Representatives of the social network noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of “unblocked” advertising, the solution from AdBlock Plus along with commercial ads also blocks many ordinary posts from friends or pages.
Facebook expressed regret about such a policy AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to a source among the developers of the social network TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on Facebook’s desktop site will be ready in the coming hours.

Dongfeng will bring Fengguang 370 crossover and Rich New pickup to Russia - website behind the wheel www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 - a representative of the growing popularity in China of the car class, combining the virtues of minivan and crossover.
Another announced Russian prime minister is the pick-up of Rich New.
Many Western companies of the Moscow International Motor Show this year decided to ignore, so the emptiness of the exhibition halls "Crocus Expo" will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, the powerful front will be Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has large views on the Russian markets and intends in the near future to offer our car lovers a number of interesting innovations.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossweight, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (just under 550,000 rubles at the current rate).
For Russians, such a price is hardly shining, and the issue of deliveries to our country is still in the stage of discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 managed to reach 11th place in the list of the best-selling minivans, although due to the large road clearance (175 mm) and the protective plastic hanger on the lower perimeter of the body it is quite possible to attach.
Crossvan is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the younger model Fengguang 360, the 370 has the same wheelbase at 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The living room is decorated with wooden planks, but the large vertical touch screen "like Tesla's" on the central console was only on early exhibition copies of crosswinds, and the cars with "music" were on sale easier.
Five of the seven seats are easily folded, forming a flat loading area of 1650 mm length, the maximum volume of the trunk - 1500 l.
The engine for Fengguang 370 is provided with only one - a 1.5-liter gasoline "atmosphere" with a capacity of 115 hp, combined with a 5-speed mechanical transmission.
On the dynamic qualities of the machine, the manufacturer is modestly silent, but promises a budget-saving appetite of the owner at the level of 6.7 l/100 km.
The Rich New pickup is well-known to the Russians of the Nissan NP300 Navara of the in-demand generation, but with a little favoured by Chinese stylists in design.
Despite the morally outdated design, this model still enjoys a stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unpretentious "workhorse".
At a similar price, Rich New is certainly interested in Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become immensely expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: petrol 2.4 liters (137 hp) or turbodiesel 2.5 liters (116 hp).
The transmission box - only the mechanics, the drive - on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with the hard-connected "forward".
It will be on the Dongfeng stand and the new flagship sedan A9, its Russian premiere the representative of the Chinese firm announced in June.
The number of crossovers on the Chinese market is increasing, with some of the latest innovations being the Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng lineup consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
During the seven months of this year, the dealers of the Chinese company sold 696 cars in our country.
Notifications on the transport tax will stop sending by mail - website Behind the wheel www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending notifications of property taxes.
All Russian car owners have become accustomed to the unchanged scheme: in summer and autumn they receive by mail a receipt for the payment of a transport tax for the previous year.
However, many of them will not wait this year.
The fact is that the tax inspection without excessive noise has changed the procedure for notifying citizens.
Those who are registered in the "Personal Cabinet of the taxpayer" on the official website of the ministry nalog.ru, notifications will come in electronic form.
In the inspection, such Russians were automatically considered online users and removed them from the standard, "paper" mailing.
The news will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
All the others will still receive the usual letters.
However, the opportunity to return to the old scheme is also available to account holders on the site.
To do this, they will have to visit the tax department during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notification will appear in the "Personal Cabinet" immediately after drafting, while the letter will go a few days and may be lost altogether.
In addition, the number of users of the online service of the tax inspection exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the department to save seriously on the mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed order.
Some could register in a “personal office” to get a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for notifications by mail and, without knowing it themselves, will fall into the category of non-payers with all the resulting consequences.
Access to the "Personal office of the taxpayer" is carried out in three ways: through the account of the portal gosuslugi.ru, by means of an electronic signature or by entering the login and password indicated in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person at any tax inspection office (regardless of the place of registration on the account).
We would like to remind you that this year the transport tax must be paid by December 1.
Notifications were sent in July.
The tuning Mercedes-Benz G-Class, in which the refinements are aimed at achieving a very high performance, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not bother G-Power’s masters, who took over the modification of the sports version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its passion for BMW cars, but nothing human to its masters is foreign.
Really, why not upgrade the G 63 - 571-powered flying coupé with tank aerodynamics and a dash to the hundred for 5.4 s?
By pumping the "muscles" of the crazy "helice", the masters took advantage of the advantages that open the 5.5-liter inflatable "eight".
But the dynamics of the acceleration to the hundred improved by indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the "flying brick" is capable of riveting for 5.3 s.
However, the accelerations from the average speeds certainly give it much better.
The flow of speed is dangerous: if the standard G 63 does not travel faster than 210 km/h, then a tuning all-wheel drive with a deactivated electronic "wheel" is capable of exceeding 250 km/h.
Outside the car is almost indistinguishable from its factory source, with the exception of other wheel discs - 23-inch Hurricane RR size 305/35 ZR 23.
The luxury unit Mercedes-Maybach has announced a stunning 6 m long concept coupe, which will be presented as part of the Pebbles-Bich Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the “green subbrand” of the BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate brand.
In the coming years, a minimum of four environmental innovations are expected.
