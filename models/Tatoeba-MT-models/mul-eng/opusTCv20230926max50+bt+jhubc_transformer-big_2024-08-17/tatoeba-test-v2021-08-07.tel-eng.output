A baby came out from under the desk.
Oh, how beautiful is Taj Mahal!
Oh, how peaceful this place is!
How's it going on the wall?
Mitch, is that true?
You're good?
You're good?
You're angry?
I'm ready to do it
Are you still afraid of something going to happen?
He didn't get married as far as I know.
How many hours do you have to go to the station?
Oh, it's gone!
The ribs are delicious.
Take the tea right away.
Take the tea.
Take care of your teeth every day.
Can I get a phone?
You've seen it?
Let's take a look at the bus stop nearby.
The kids like to cook.
Come on, I'll give you some too.
No, I'm not.
Is all this really happening?
Did you go to work yesterday?
Don't hesitate to ask me for help.
Don't stop at my work.
Is there anything else to say about that?
Do you know why he's so angry?
You're living in this area?
Do you want to be a mom before you're seven?
Give this book to Ram.
Give it to Ram.
Go there tomorrow.
Go there.
It's an International Women's Day!
Did you come from the school?
Is there a leak?
Is Erra Gulabi dead?
Is there a guillotine?
"Did you work from home?
"Did you work from home?
Have you ever been to Paris?
Have you ever had a heart attack?
"Did you work from home?
Did you eat it?
He didn't keep his word.
He wore clothes like a woman's.
He's got three times more money than me.
There are two pens next to him, one with a length of another.
He's put
He is Ram.
He teaches Spanish to his children.
The help came too late.
He gave her a book of books.
The arms and legs are long, and the legs are long.
He's our boy.
He's made every decision.
He hit me.
He's not a good doctor, he's a good doctor.
He put blood on his hands, and he put it on his hands.
Do you want to go out for dinner tonight?
How are you going to come?
How are you?
How are you?
How'd you get that bomb?
How many do you want to be?
How many do you want to be?
You're good?
How big is she?
Is the work I've done?
I began to talk.
I can't stay here longer.
I don't like coffee.
I'll make mistakes too.
I don't agree
I don't have time to talk now.
I don't know where they are.
I don't know who won.
I don't need anything.
I don't speak Japanese.
I don't believe him
I'm not talking to you.
I've been drinking coffee.
I've heard the clock
I hear you're not good.
I know you'll tell me one thing.
I'll be very careful.
I'll leave this time.
I'm going to start this very soon.
I'm going to the next stop.
It's making me cry again.
I'm learning the Burmese language.
I'm not allowed to do that here.
It's been a great day for me to make my own decisions.
I'm really sorry about last night.
I know he's coming.
I'm usually doing it.
I've never seen him.
I went home.
I know you're my brother.
You're good?
I had to be able to do it all.
Mitch, is that true?
Is there good water there?
Is the work complete?
Is it Chinese or Japanese? It's Korean
My advice to you to do it.
"Did you work from home?
"Did you work from home?
It's not so easy
I don't think it's useful
It's hard to speak English
It can take up to an hour or more in the afternoon.
What's not good for them
It's time to get out of school.
It's not all your fault.
It's very valuable
It is clear that there is no other way.
It's not my fault.
I made a mistake, but I didn't.
I've never been to Japan.
I've got it
If I were you, I wouldn't be there today.
There are two sides to a single damage
Laila is getting married.
Lalit has been called.
Don't let him be there
Let's take that opportunity.
Mary bought a small bag of handbags.
Mary bought a new dress for the party.
Mary would have lied to you, but she didn't.
Mary was shocked to hear what she had done.
Mary Boy's friend told her that she was going to leave.
He's coming to dinner tonight.
Please don't give me another cup of coffee.
I don't see my bag anywhere.
My computer is expensive.
My dad isn't home right now.
I'm going to sleep when I see my brother.
It's hurting my head
We've got tennis there.
They didn't come
You don't have to kill me either.
That's real?
You're telling the truth?
Ah, the joy!
Oh, it's gone!
You've fallen from the ground up!
The ancients were slow to move.
One, two, two, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Only the animal's body contains fat.
Out of sight, out of mind.
People believe that it's God.
Ramo is here.
Ram is here.
Ramo is here.
It's a lesson.
It's a lesson.
It is education.
I asked him how many languages I'd like to speak.
She's got cold air.
Aiden doesn't have children.
Abby doesn't want to say more.
She's sitting on her lap.
She was terrified of the child's death.
She's not a doctor.
He's not at home anymore.
She has been teaching music for 30 years.
He's on his way to school.
She was terrified of her.
Show me where the pain is going to be.
Sita made me feel good.
Sita laughed.
It's not good for you to sit all day.
Some of the dogs are alive.
Tell me about your day-to-day life
Thank you so much for making me squirm.
The boy is a little boy.
It's a party.
It seems to be very interesting
It's not easy, you know.
Sin has been severely punished.
Sin has been extinguished.
He's crying for power
It's not over yet today
The movie's going to start
Shabash, the bomb is good.
There are islands in the sea.
There is no reason to be afraid.
There's nothing else
These pencils are in the same color.
You can't get these socks off
It's near the station
The work is almost done.
They're dead
They'll sing a song
This is a very smart question.
I used to eat it all the time.
It is not a word.
It hurt me a lot.
This plant has some long-lasting roots.
Tom Garrett has promised to leave the family.
Tom was holding his hands in the air.
His eyelashes were covered with hot soapy water, and he sat down on the pillow.
Tom was very frightened.
Is it really that bad?
It's better to leave him alone
We did it to be.
We don't understand French.
We didn't sleep for days.
Shabash, you've done well with this bomb!
We need money to do what we want to do.
We've got to get people to work.
We played basketball last night.
We have to let go of ourselves
We want to hear
What are you going to do tomorrow?
What are you saying?
What did you talk about?
You talked about what.
What else am I going to lose?
What does it mean to say the game doesn't mean anything?
What's the length of the book?
What's the time now?
Mitch, is that true?
What's in the box?
What's the time now?
What's your room number?
How much time has passed?
What are you going to take?
When are you going to stop drinking?
When are you going to sit down?
When do you come from Vijayawada?
When are you coming back?
You'll understand when you're my father.
Where'd you put my book?
Where's Mary?
Where's your boy?
Where there's no music, there's no music.
What color do you like, whether it's blue or white?
What's your dream?
Who are we?
Why can't you be prepared?
Why aren't you sleeping yet?
Why can't the giraffes sing?
Why did you call me?
Why did you lie to her?
She opened the door when she hit her head.
Mistakes
You can do it
Yes ?
You're a young
You can eat in this room.
You don't have to go to Sgt.
You've got to come once.
You can either hit him or go catch him with fish.
You have to speak out loud.
Stay where you are, wherever you are.
You're very happy you're
You've come so fast.
