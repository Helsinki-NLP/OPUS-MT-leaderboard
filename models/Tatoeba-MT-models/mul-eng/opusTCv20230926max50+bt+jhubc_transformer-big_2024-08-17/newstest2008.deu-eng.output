Food is to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation measured in the euro area is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the Eurozone, the price was higher than expected in November – after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg reports.
Official forecasts were down from just 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the American, British, and Canadian central bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered its interest rates, which they believe would favor rising commodity prices and a slight fall in unemployment to create a spiral of inflation.
The ECB aims to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two-percent mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the swing: one has to “negotiate” inflation in order to rule out later needs for action.
With 3.3 percent, the inflation rate reached a record 12-year high in Germany in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Responsible for the rise in inflation in the euro area are the rising food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat ratings rose by 88 percent, and the price of soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in food oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price of crude oil rose by 52 percent this year – last month the price per barrel of black gold reached almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent in 2008, but in 2009 it is expected to fall to 1.9 percent.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 per cent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup faces government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown significantly until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has had the largest base camp, while approval for the socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
The difference is clear for the loyal voters thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two-thirds (71 percent) are opposed to one-fifth (20 percent) of the vote for the MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ, according to a survey, are under the parliamentary entry barrier: they reach two percent of the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low point, the overall economic mood has further deteriorated – never before has the proportion of those who regard the country’s economic situation as “extremely bad” been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it to be “quite bad”.
After more hopeful outlooks in spring and summer, families again see the change in their financial situation more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration in the situation; only a tenth is expected to improve.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents — a historic high — rated the prime minister’s work as “rather bad than right.”
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny in general, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n is 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% distrust of the party head of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who believe that the discontent with the Prime Minister could be addressed even without a change of government.
If, after the unrest last October, 35% had voted for the remaining government and the head of government, this share today amounts to only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent responded that they were “safely” participating, and another 20 percent would “likely” cast their vote.
For comparison, if the parliamentary elections were held this Sunday, only 55 per cent would go to the polls "surely", another 15 per cent would consider their participation to be "likely", and in view of these trends, the outcome of the referendum would be predictable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital taggeld.
When transferred to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty", the share of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would even be 81, 84, and 89 percent, respectively.
Auchan most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Buda trade area have also maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in value added tax this year.
Articles from Daily Economy
In the Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" also increased by 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets price increases of over 1,000 HUF were registered.
Since prices in the food markets were "galoped out" in December last year, the costing has not declined dramatically, compared to the anyway high, earlier output level.
However, it certainly has a deterrent effect on consumers that what they had paid far below HUF 9,000 last year is not even available for HUF 10,000 this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeds the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets examined.
The highest price was HUF 10,573.
(In 6800, the price was HUF 6,800.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, while prices for putenbreast fillets, nuts and molluscs have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of bread rolls for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price drop on the product below 200 HUF.
Also surprising here was the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola bottle of less than 200 HUF, so the drink including bottle cost only 257 HUF.
However, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison Auchan cut the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart by 15 percent compared to last year's Christmas prices, while Tesco and Auchan each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between last year's cheapest shopping cart and today's most expensive year's most expensive was 12%, while the increase between last year's cheapest shopping cart and most expensive year's most expensive one was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase was still forint 1,206,00 last year, but the value added tax increase was noticeable at last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that has affected the trade very much: apparently, the department stores could not quite decide which price ranges to apply to the individual items, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were unpredictable.
(If the trader badly plans a product’s circulation speed, he can fall for substantial gains in the price range, which is based on traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price of the "Napi" shopping cart fell so radically in the past year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forints, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 forints.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1.630.00 forints more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284,00 forints.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, the price of daily consumer items in hypermarkets has increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foods, the Statistical Office established a more than 30 % cost over a period of 12 months.
So in addition to flour also in eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year, even in the worst case, has barely increased by more than 10 percent.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers – after all, they were able to roll down the drastic price increase to the multis.
In the golden trading triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores are no longer looking at prices at all.
It is purchased from large quantities, durable food goes in pallets over the store tables.
Wednesday morning there were endless queues at the cashier in all three department stores, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower frequency of customers is reported by the country, so that many multis complain to the opinion researchers, they could not even reach the planned turnover, not only in food, but also in sustainable consumer goods.
Disinfectants are saved in many places
More than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals, which were due to improper handling of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overcrowding of the staff - all factors that are not exactly conducive to the containment of infections, according to the lead doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital, an MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was admitted to the hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection.
The victim of a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but shortly thereafter the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation has not yet been carried out because of the bacterium, which is still in the patient's body.
Until 10 December of this year, infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported from hospitals in 1094 to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the lead physician of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been recorded in hospitals with certainty, but the dark numbers are likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of the people in its nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as throat inflammation, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well-healed.
However, if the agents are too high-dose or improperly applied, the well-responsive bacteria produce antibiotic-resistant, which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
In particular, in patients with a weakened, or permanently malfunctioning immune system, but also in elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the daily life of the hospital.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi said - MRSA is just not there where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
“Such patients are isolated, the care staff wear rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment,” says Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are being tested for MRSA when they are admitted to the hospital, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is too rare
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be preventable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for the inhibition of the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
After this infection is prevalent in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine the patients who were delivered and immediately isolate MRSA-infected patients.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, microbiological sampling is not so common.
Not least because there are no grants for this examination on the part of the state health fund.
Therefore, most cases only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
On the part of the European Union there are strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, that is, microbiological examinations are necessary so that no resistance to the drug can be formed, but these directives are not always complied with by hospitals.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer among outpatients, or patients in basic care, according to Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
Saved by the disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to the other by caregivers.
This is precisely why handwashing, or wearing gloves and masks, is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by drip infection or contact, but in domestic hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds barely lined up, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz goes on to note, unfortunately, in the financially less well-prepared hospitals, it even happens that when disinfectants are saved, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that exactly favor the emergence of infections.
Such infections are found to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped, where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
Government program against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections in the grip causes health insurance to incur huge costs, so they are combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment in the government program, was maintained.
After the first signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
The police chief was not drunk.
In the case of the fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official opinion is now available.
The now retired police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholized nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the Budapest Attorney General’s Office on Friday after the official opinion on the case was submitted.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he took office.
The former police chief with his own car in the XXII district entered Kossuth Lajos Street and drove over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unsigned spot.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, nadirang.)
The pedestrian has sustained his injuries after being admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then laid back his functions and applied for retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor’s Office has launched its investigation into the incident.
In addition, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit agreements worth a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million in Budapest on Friday.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million was already signed earlier, the current agreement concerns the use of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also to be spent on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later on as part of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will flow mainly in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the metro line 4 also came into being.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of the metro financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest rates are EURIBOR-linked, the loan is made available by the EIB with an 8-year delay, commission-free.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe looks carefully at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who is buying the EU’s cheapest market, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently without a doubt the most desirable patch for real estate purchases in the Eastern European area, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Among the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, on the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the riders, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria we also attract investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favorable area of Russe records more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office spaces offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of the most attractive European golf paradise, and thus, in addition to the summer and winter season, attract tourists in the other two seasons.
Therefore, forward-looking investors are already buying in the big style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also looking for a change in their lives.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle will either buy revitalized real estate for 50-100,000 euros, or downsized houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they will then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are widely written, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is made up of business people who invest with the aim of medium to long-term value growth.
Real estate in the capital, however, is becoming increasingly expensive, due to the ever-growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there has been a 21 percent annual price increase.
The increase in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries advise on the timetable for Bali, which sets out the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol expires.
There is currently a fierce debate between industrial and developing countries.
The U.S. has already signalled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other big question of the conference is whether the industrialized countries are willing to support developing countries both financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement was also reached on the support of developing countries.
The adaptation fund, which is subject to the Kyoto Protocol, is to be managed by a 16-member council, which is expected to be read in the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as described in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's 6 percent
Environment Minister G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured in 1990 values), regardless of whether the "Agreement after 2012" will be achieved successfully or not. The Union would even be ready to take on a 30 percent reduction if other major industrialised countries are responsible for their development and development, or if they are responsible for their own development.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor stressed that the target of the States that had acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 per cent, whereas the EU had already committed itself to a decrease of 8% with its 15 Member States at the time.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a target that the country will fully comply with, as can be seen in the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
The use is high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly come into force only after 2012. In this case, the reduction project set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed by a new, international emission reduction system, its significance also by the IP
This would delay the emission reduction, and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2<0xC2><0xB0>C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army advertises on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the purpose of increasing popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special Forces stationed in Afghanistan have been loading videos online since March 2006 about operations conducted against the Taliban, reports the BBC.
Shots with miniature cameras attached to helmets are controlled at the air force base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under “defence headquarters” in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the Iraq-based International Peace Forces (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the public about the actual objectives of foreign operations.
Such published propaganda is almost free of charge compared to traditional television commercials, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message in their own way, as they are the right of existence of the military measures decided by the government.
Americans advertising with game
However, the army must also fight against amateur footage, which, in addition to the carefully edited, censored footage, also make it online - such as those that show the death of soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, however, the losses of the war will not be discussed at all.
Of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, by the way, numerous videos have already been uploaded to the platform in use, but this "gentlemanship" has only recently been discovered by the British themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less lifelike simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth is by no means simplistic: instead of a Christmas party, she organizes a working conference in which her employees can make the year 2007 with coffee and tea bags.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure up Christmas mood with tombola or push into the official hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - this is how the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already caught up with the offices.
The biggest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held this year in the defense resort, but the employees of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas of the orphans" children are given by fallen soldiers, at the "mission party" family members are awarded by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other resorts, the National Agency for Development (NF<0xC3><0x9C>) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport beat the strands.
The 4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economy is held in the house of the future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a tombola parade.
The National Agency for Development (NF<0xC3><0x9C>) held its 4.7 million-euro Christmas celebration on Wednesday in the House of the National Council of Justice (ILO), with concerts and a party.
The rent was 1 million Forint, the rest was spent for more than 400 guests.
According to our information, a department of the NF<0xC3><0x9C> is also invited to another Christmas party, which is organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("V<0xC3><0xAD>gsz<0xC3><0xAD>nh<0xC3><0xA1>z") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information as we have not reached the authorities.
Why the suit?
The ILO building was open not only to the guests of the NF<0xC3><0x9C>, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the ILO for the use of the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech from the minister, after the dinner there was live music for dancing.
At the request of [origo] it was shared: There was no ball dress or suit duty on the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour, and Self-Government are each preparing for Puritan celebrations.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for employees in its four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Minister of Labour M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party, but to the conference on the anniversary.
About 180 guests are expected, who - according to the press department - are served only with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration starts with 350,000 forints.
Self-administration Minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply appear in the Ministry’s room.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is hosting a Christmas party in its own festival hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured at 2,500 forints per head - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent boost.
Since the beginning of the term of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, the employees of the PM have been celebrating in this way every year.
However, there will not be a proper party mood - not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration was set up for the afternoon.
On January 20, the Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year’s reception, this time the Ministry’s Christmas celebration falls.
One hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the Stadtpark ("V<0xC3><0xA1>rosliget"); according to the resort's information, the expenses are estimated at 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally start with a short speech by the Minister and end with a reserved smear.
As the corresponding press offices report on [origo] request, there will be a Christmas celebration neither at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
Asked about the cost of the Christmas celebration, no information could be given at the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which will be held at the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation of Trade Unions will form their coordination committee on Friday for an indefinite strike starting on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest assembly will be held, and on Monday – the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act – the job cuts begin.
It is expected to have strike-related, significant traffic jams, as rail traffic is almost completely stopped, and Budapest public transport companies (BKV) also strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced on Friday afternoon by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions.
A LIGA - MOSZ Strike Committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest meeting will be held, and as of Monday, all organizations that have joined the strike will lay down the work for an indefinite period, unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike that began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
Should the National Council not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions shall immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will come together to advise on the further procedure.
Due to the National Council’s agenda on Monday, it is even conceivable that it will come only in the late evening hours, or even at midnight to vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The strikes, which begin on Monday, will have to take into account significant obstacles to transport: the railways lay down their work for an indefinite period of time, in the morning most of the public transport and more than half of the Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n companies stand still.
At the same time, there will be roadblocks in many places in one direction.
The call to strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is updated on the league website on an ongoing basis.
Some organizations announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, others plan for a temporary job cut.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian Railway M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Free Trade Union of Railways VDSZSZ, although more and more people are on the train during the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV from the start of operations until 1 p.m., Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m., the LIGA unions for electricity and heat energy are putting the work down for four hours, and the teachers' union bwz. the Democratic teachers' union has been up to 2 or 2-8 sts.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes across the country alternatingly at different times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Workers in Health and Social Welfare, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for Cooperation of the Trade Unions, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points requested by the league is that the government takes back the draft for health insurance reform and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Claim number three means that access to the early retirement system is already possible before 2010 for eligible professional groups.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer concerning the secondary lines submitted by the Ministry of Transport and now calls for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungary's Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August with the support of the "Movement for a better Hungary", have raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The Institute’s “Risk Warning Report” states, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the “enhancing of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsies and non-Gypsies population in Hungary, which could even be eliminated in the short term.
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provoking such an argument, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian opposition."
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremes, and increase the likelihood of violent clashes.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard would have, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the local and foreign media, "the image of Hungary abroad is significantly damaged, especially as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been continuously on the rise, so since the summer of 2007, several organizations have been established, calling themselves the "National Self-Defense Association".
"These groups are common in that they each define themselves as a civilian organization, while they openly boast of preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defense tasks (catastrophe protection, self-defense, law enforcement), calling for the inadequacy of the police," he said.
And further: all this is done according to that method, which attempts to tarnish various political and party-based aspirations of the population as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association therefore not only serve to circumvent legal barriers that could appear in court in the course of registration - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increasing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited in several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, as some ultranationalist politicians from certain neighbouring countries see in the emergence of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region," he said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central-Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, the establishment of which was announced in August 2007 by the right-wing Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass expulsions, which took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the events immediately on the occasion of the establishment of the National Guard, with the argument that the goal of the organization is "national protection".
In her opinion, in the past 17 years, a real “giant terror” has been felt in Bulgaria, but the state has remained helpless and indifferent – so Political Capital.
And further: the initiative would have launched a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As stated, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also proven by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to establish their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not to be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organizing their own protections, says the Risk Warning Report of Political Capital.
Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annually, risk analysis reports would be published, and if changing trends in risk were to be identified, public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the issuance of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere Holidays
In Hungary, holidays are strictly regulated by law, so the practice of redeploying the working days around the holidays has now established itself, however, the next year we are given fewer such days.
Also in the EU and in America one understands something else under "Feast Day".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and non-working days.
Work-free days are usually ecclesial holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the latter alone so that the New Year celebrations can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are the 15th of March, which commemorates the Revolution of 1848, and the 23rd of October, the Memorial Day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, the foundation of the state, on May 1, we celebrate the work, on November 1 and 2, we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each for Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of “working day shift” has proven itself in cases where we would only work a day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
If this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be finalized, the Minister of Labour has for many years set out in his own regulation.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and contractors, to public employees and public service officials.
Exceptions are only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on holidays.
Heuer’s working order is only somewhat confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24th, life will remain formal in this country, since most of the days between Christmas and New Year’s Eve will take a time off balance, or the holiday specifically cancelled for this purpose.
Next year, more holidays fall into the middle of the week, or towards the end of the week, so that there will be fewer redeployments in the working days than this year.
The calendar is first put on the head around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for the same four days.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day so that Friday, May 2nd can be a rest day.
The second rearrangement is related to the holiday on October 23: On Saturday, October 18th you will have to finish in advance on Friday, October 24th.
The end of the year, however, will be completely in the sign of holidays, after all will be and will remain from December 24th, even if New Year’s Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six scary little things to annoy your co-workers
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: they bring "color" into everyday life at work.
The question is simply whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or you better face the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandings consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
“Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department,” says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to take advantage of it again by perhaps calling the marketing department and being polite, you would have forgotten to correct the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the matter is settled with an apology.
Before engaging in embarrassing excuses, one should consider how to prepare one's colleagues for really unpleasant moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Borrowing something that doesn’t belong to you?
There’s hardly anything more nerve-wracking than when you grab a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday the booklet was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost believed ballpoint pen discovered, for example, on a colleague’s desk?
Without questions, you should not borrow anything from colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find that something has gone wrong.
So, don’t put envelopes or post-it out of the office, because it could hit one yourself: no more there if you need it urgently.
Chatting about the private lives of colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop a tratsch that has already been put into the world.
Who with whom, what did you do?
Where and why?
One should not tie the information (or assumptions) about the private lives of colleagues to the nose as much as possible!
And if someone opens up and reveals to us his inner secret, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to keep quiet like a grave, rather than aligning those who are not present, even if others are aware of the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick for no reason?
If you call in the office to report a painful headache, because you just feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be clear about one thing: your own work, unresponsive achievements, projects with fixed dates must now be done by colleagues instead of yourself.
So don’t play bad with your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you won’t be able to do it in the office the next day, or that something might come in between, why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Summaries, Likes, Phone calls
One has just deepened in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud chatter of colleagues?
Unwanted to hear a phone call you shouldn’t have heard?
You shouldn’t bother your colleagues with summaries, singing, loud conversations (which you carry over their heads), trampling, persistent spasms, or snoring.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not specifically in-depth in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not completed on time, you have to send an important letter or important news, you should not look for the fault of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes, and apologize if others were affected too!
The question of how to fix the error again, or recover the missing one, is just too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training trousers and slippers: Comfortable for home, but has not lost anything in the office!
Even then, you shouldn’t dress like this if it actually allowed the workplace!
Just don't get too slender - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress accordingly in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Want to make it right for everyone – or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
From the radio sounds a strange melody: the sound of a violin, coupled with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The pace changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar that sounds on mr2.
The local music scene hasn’t spoiled us with high-quality electropop for a long time.
But now you can even see the dust differently when you hear Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so some new and exciting production from the domestic digital underground scene, slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even when the garage rock with its guitar quitch is again "in", the domestic electropop proves: there is something new under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger started in Pécs, playing himself in the band Yonderboi, before he began to go his own way - perhaps because a house does not carry two pipes.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which fuses elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, he only succeeded when he was asked to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
"Season" by Ferenc T<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>k).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, was only known to the wider public when the magazine "wan2" ranked her first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, became the almost only, also marketable trend setter in the West.
Zagar and his band "trendy" were in doubt, but no one was interested if they also like to wear this brand.
The band reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album, titled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead", could open up new avenues for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The term comes from the time when Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger was still traveling with another band.
The airy, flying adulation would be fine, but besides the essential character of music, the louder guitars - corresponding to the spirit of the times and the trends - the influences of rock'n'roll appear.
With these songs, the singer Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rgy Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", has presented himself at the premiere in Millen<0xC3><0xA1>ris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio beat - the most recent from early to late pop music broadcast Mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi has listened to the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded successively by six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is fine (?).
The hvg.hu has requested from Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How much is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger: The term "skichtmusik" does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and non-singing, but it can also be produced only for the sale that makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The listener’s willingness to listen also works according to this principle, regardless of languages and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
Zs.: Abroad, especially in the west of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
There not only teenagers or twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that are happening around them, much more attentive because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.: Of course, it’s a good feeling to see more and more of our concerts coming.
We have never written for the market.
With us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is usually felt in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but these in turn exist only in the unattainable changes of the moment.
However, I noticed one thing: If you want to do it right, you are no longer interested.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is a soloist and has built his career in the West.
Zs.: We don’t really go his way, except that we try to interpret this in our music over and over again.
We see ourselves as team players who trust the other person’s musical presence and let them develop.
In the beginning, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style in the direction of a wider audience?
Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit that would then be retained as a drawhorse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to solve the clungorgy and the slightly more difficult issues.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why exactly did she, what was the guiding principle?
Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea to compose the choir from gifted soloists of the local music scene.
This is how the six-piece choir was created - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we later named "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Would you like the song to be the same, or did you design it for the girls?
Zs.: The number was already in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still "needs something".
The accordion sequence formally called for a singing voice.
I started the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came practically on the rise and appallingly spontaneous.
I can remember, I was quite electrified at the time, but it also needed the "divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, however, one had the impression that the girls would be in the background.
There is no solo party (except for the short solo by Judy Jay), they have no role of their own, sing together completely and are not louder than the music, so their song is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also on the stage behind.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately didn’t want them to have solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting his ego a little, forgetting who came from where and where he was going, just letting us pick up these particular wings, the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song came out.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
Zs.: In the musical creation work there is really no one, there have been more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove no longer wanted to work, but gradually everything came together, as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
Zs.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and also now that I have "lost" the album.
Currently, it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraudulent brokers risked billions for feelings of inferiority
Soilless Fraudster
For example, his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komer<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xAD> banka.
In fact, it came in at almost five billion euros because of it.
But it seems more like Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do the same to his colleagues, and he certainly wasn’t incapable.
In contrast to all major banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He's mentally weak," was heard from the mouths of his superiors, who alerted him to the police.
But as Kerviels points out, which the French media, for example the daily Le Monde, published, he was a man who had made a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year with his business.
The crisis is not only in America
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in a statement.
In the summer, he was able to make half a billion euros in the American crisis.
He had already missed the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were first reports that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had previously had payment problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
A lot of people didn’t believe it and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had screwed his profits up to 1.6 billion euros.
“Even when I earned the first half billion, I didn’t know how to explain it,” Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely didn’t keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he has forged documents so as not to get on his toes.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though he was gradually interested in the Eurex stock exchange for his business.
Risk Profits
Was he afraid to fly?
I don't think so.
“I thought it satisfied the simple fact that I earned $1.6 billion for the bank.”
Why did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
He knew that he would never earn as much as anyone else.
“As early as my first conversation in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigating officer.
But soon after his arrival, the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros on the price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses supposedly knew about everything, or knew it.
"As long as I made money, you closed your eyes."
But then came the big blow at the beginning of this year.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they get to him?
He was suspicious of a vacation.
“I only took four days from last year.
A broker who doesn’t take a vacation is one who doesn’t want to be looked at in the cards,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion
Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, allowing the Czech Republic to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>365 billion) in the next few years.
This represents about half of the total that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About SEK 125 billion comes from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive approximately SEK 100 billion from the "Enterprise and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into the traffic expansion.
The Transport Programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 per cent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money will increase according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The "Enterprise and Innovation" program is designed to help entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative ventures.
As a result, companies are expected to raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
With the previous acquisition of money from EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the new accession countries one of the least successful so far.
Nicaraguan court confirms 20-year prison sentence for ex-presidents
A Nicaraguan appeals court on Thursday upheld the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, to which he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his farm in the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is coming back behind bars is currently unclear, according to the news agency AP.
According to Ileana Pérez, the president of the Court of Appeals, it will now depend on the prison officials whether to allow Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n to serve his sentence at home or whether he needs to go to prison.
A court found four years ago that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n had regularly transferred money from the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually landed in a fund set up by Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n to finance his campaign in 2001.
Budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget designed by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year was approved with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (Social Democrats) because it had been submitted by Minister Sobotka (of this party), and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not therefore afford to reject it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little-respected, yet most important law in all tranquility.
This is, in a way, paradoxical.
Everything begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
In the past social democratic governments, the state budgets have suffered from three weaknesses that the 2008 budget cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of spending that is required by law, not only because of pensions, but also because of social spending that the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is deficit fiscal policy as a result of the first weak point.
The third limitation is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to income from taxes, taxes, and bank loans, issued additional sources of investment, often unconsidered bonds, through which they owed their town halls in excess.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off these debts through the massive sale of shares of energy and other supply networks that they had received from the state in the course of privatisation.
Now this source is already defeated.
Insofar as we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
our economy has been going through a period of growth for several years, like the rest of the world, which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is proud of.
This provided a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owed even more to the state.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have far more reasonable economies than our Republic.
This is a huge scandal that is mainly attributed to the previous governments.
We are among the countries that, as seen on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why no massive social programmes are needed, which, unfortunately, have just been inflated in a huge way in recent years.
Even if it has succeeded in eliminating part of the senseless populist spending that was passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is not a shift in the retirement age and pension reform in the near future, then virtually any policy in this country will end, and, no matter who is doing it, it will not end.
It is only slightly exaggerated when it is said that then from ruling politicians will become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social expenditures.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be a revolution, but can only contain the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The expected deficit of NOK 70 billion for 2008 would be quite superfluous if previous governments had not spent in the last ten years, whatever went on.
If we don't want to make it real that from the ruling politicians, we need to be patient, and this not too strong coalition government, but is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on other forms of taxes and fees, rest in peace with the government.
Only these will allow a gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the UK, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
Thus, more than $100 billion will go to the foreign exchange markets through auctions.
At these auctions, the banks sell interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the U.S. Fed sends $40 billion to auction, another 24 makes it loose for the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time since the attacks on 11 September that the central banks of the individual states agree on such a coordinated approach to the defence or mitigation of the consequences of a financial crisis.
“This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of freely available capital that banks can provide,” wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in a report for its customers.
“The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%,” Baumohl added in his report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion due to unfunded loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are expecting billions more losses.
"The central banks must have been really scared of what could happen when they decided to do this," said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he continued.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have hard access to bonds, loans will become more expensive for their customers as well.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession, possibly impacting economic growth around the world.
The central banks decided to do so after they failed to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used to lend money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend each other money, and that although the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
“This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates,” said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of Reuters.
Some analysts are of the opinion that this move by the central banks contributes to the heating of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: The debate of the ecologists is incredible
Global climate change is said to be the most damaging to developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the upcoming UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, Not a Green Planet", he explained that the debates of the ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric they accompany and the reality.
“The debate there is unstructured, it’s a word-of-mouth fire that’s just a substitute for a real solution to current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed in the presentation of his book that his topic is very important to him and that he is therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often encounter cartoons of my views."
Now interested parties could therefore read his attitude unconcernedly.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
He is, after all, an academic, able to understand and assess professional negotiations, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists about global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too big and too serious, and that we do not pose a threat to climate change, and that we do not pose a threat to climate change.
In addition, he considers it unacceptable for someone who has experience with totalitarian systems to impose other unproven views, he sees this as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
On questions from attendees, he repeatedly stated that he is not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had already spoken on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driver’s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to apply for an exchange so that the authorities can issue a new driver's license by the end of the year.
However, the ministry does not fear that hundreds of thousands of drivers will leave the streets after New Year without a valid driving license.
According to the authorities, mainly those have not exchanged their driver's license, who no longer want to drive.
While small towns report a sharp decline in interest in the driver's license exchange, the offices of the capital are flooded with applications, and interest in the exchange has grown this week.
The city administration produces around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, approximately 140000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver’s license.
The exhibition of a new driver's license lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver has to pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who fail to make the required exchange by the end of the year and leave without a valid driver's license will face a fine starting in January.
The perpetrator pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also use a warning when the offence is committed.
In the event of a violation, the penalty can increase to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the one from the municipality can also receive a penalty that does not drive at all.
He could face a fine of up to <0xC2><0xA3>30,000.
The ministry has already called on the authorities to keep mild and impose a maximum penalty of 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, however, no one is threatening a thousand kroner punishment.
The driver’s license is a document where everyone can decide whether or not to own it.
It is not a personal identity card that everyone, and indeed a valid one, must have.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driver's license.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 become invalid.
However, drivers have to gradually exchange other types of driver's licenses.
People with driver’s licenses from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued from 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional driver’s licenses.
Court lowers penalties for detectives who were allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, who are accused of having done a joint thing with David Berdych’s gang, were given 13 or 10 years in prison.
This was decided by the Prague Oberlandesgericht in a court of law, which reduced their sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crime" were threatened for 14 or 12 years.
Against today’s judgment there is no possibility of appeal, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also charged in this matter, but at first he is faced with the initial verdict.
In other cases, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
He cannot be condemned anymore.
A district court in January blamed 19 people for involvement in robberies, the Oberlandesgericht today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants disputed from the beginning to the prosecution with the justification that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, police officers, in consultation with Berdych Criminals, provided information from police sources, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang escape prosecution.
The band left Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k 30 percent of the loot.
The charges relate to crimes committed by the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, because of robberies, the victims of which often suffer serious injuries, but also because of official measurement and illegal possession of weapons.
In the case of house searches, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel cores, a laser target telescopic tube and a machine gun.
According to the indictment, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns due to their robberies.
With the exception of almost 20 men in this procedure, Berdych’s courts and a number of others were found guilty of further robberies.
Further men from Berdych's district must be held accountable in another trial, further cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main proceedings have so far been held by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in Irish custody awaiting the final decision on their extradition for the purpose of prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a delivery clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> wants 12 million crowns compensation plus court costs.
For each of the mothers every three million, for the fathers every two million and for the children every one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l, is therefore totally opposed to the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is about a multiple too high," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after today's negotiation.
"But in order for us to be able to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the other side has drawn up.
We will see if it has any value at all.
However, we insist that this should be in the hundreds of thousands of sub-areas together," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov wanted a million crowns for each month that she did not raise her biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was a report developed for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children, according to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffer psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths.
The men tolerated the stress situation better, even though they saw accusations against themselves that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, coped worse with the aftermath of the trauma they experienced, as well as with what is currently going on, Veleba summed up the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> clinic last year on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>ks in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanov<0xC3><0xA1> to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the district chief of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina (Bohemian-M<0xC3><0xA1>hrische H<0xC3><0xB6>he) handed over 100,000 kroner to each family as a substitute for expenses incurred by them by the failure of the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>, which is subordinate to the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law for liability reasons.
In case of doubt, they must resort to a reserve fund, only exceptionally can they apply for help from the carrier.
The courts have so far agreed on comparatively low amounts of damages, the amounts determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka came for his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the dispute over the brand "Kingdom of Walachei".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walachian King", but the project had built a team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> in cooperation with the actor in many years of work.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka did not participate in the negotiations today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's parasitic part," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
In the words "Walachian Kingdom" everyone introduced themselves to this actor and comedian.
The same is true of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We’ve been working behind us for almost 10 years.
Money acquisition and concepts of the activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is a dispute over money.
“After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to win parasitic at our work," he said.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka used the term "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
But this did not coincide with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Walachian passports.
An initially fun action crystallized a business and an entrepreneurial activity, to which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then joined the founding of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered discounts to its owners when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also argued today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> used only the mere idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka had made public in the broadcast "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vkas has certainly helped the project of the Walachian Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> project and its team were dedicated to him intensively.
The cooperation of today's parties lasted until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized the official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Since then, however, the disputes between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> began to pile up, culminating in the subsection "King Boleslav I elected until St. Nimmerlein's Day".
The leading role then took on the suggestion of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> as queen mother.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>’s prepared competition for the throne and half a princess.
A new king should emerge from this.
He did not want to reveal details and an appointment.
“We don’t want to overdo anything.
It should be something like the king's shift in Walachei.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can also sign up peacefully," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Disadvantages
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much worth, the quality of the gear circuit, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The combination with the name SW is still a bit further, and I just have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic 207 Hatchback, for example, I had to complain about the too low headroom on the back seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the combination is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Fast forward
I only go through the interior for a short time, so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a fairly successful design, where I have objections only because of the commercial mid-tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we may complain about too short seats or headrests.
The position of the side has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As far as the room offer is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the bodywork here.
In the combination, the aforementioned lack of headroom is also eliminated.
Luggage in the trunk
The main thing about this car, however, is the cargo space.
I have to describe it (also because of the fold-up back window) as very well loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with holding belts, which represent an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, they can be pulled apart and also hold heavier objects.
But let’s talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 liters, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not in comparison to the best-selling vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav product, we find that the Peugeot is left with a clearly noticeable 52 liters.
This value is already critical for a foreign holiday or when inviting a stroller.
But to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat cargo space after folding the back seats or the very low cargo rate.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 liters and an output of 88 kWp.
And to be honest, this should look like a 1600-kubik engine that drives a family-hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and pulls well away.
If I compare him to his counterpart at <0xC5><0xA0>koda, which sometimes seems like his exhaust is clogged with a patch, then I can only be excited about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
But we have to remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine in the amount of 329900 kroner is still on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 kroner, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car beats again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had headlights, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper release, electric window lifts behind and...
Thus, the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That’s a lot, but you’re going to expect the extra equipment of a Fabia together and you’re going to arrive at a very similar sum.
So only the decision remains which brand to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, resulting in local fears about the further development of local schooling.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where disputes between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, harassment and robberies among students have been transferred to the relationship between the parents.
The situation has developed so far that police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended himself by insulting the boy with racist abuses.
Police also had to intervene against a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two underage girls.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks against the man and threw him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed onto a bus house and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he slapped us with apples and pears and then blew his butt," a mother of Slovak students from The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the struggle with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cited cases testify that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks have been reported who came here looking for work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools, according to the report.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, that will be fulfilled if you choose only the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and soothing cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this to an abundant extent.
Only on an island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a warehouse or transit warehouse of treasures that the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was founded at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the leaders of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the ban) was seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rises grew, over the wide boulevards drove cars that were among the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Coj<0xC3><0xAD>mar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as you wish.
And the iconic cars of the 1950s still run around in Havana today because the once imported Schiglis and Fiats in the salty and humid air have long since disappeared.
Havana, especially its oldest part, may have come down heavily, nowhere in the vicinity you can find as many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are just cleared out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings urgently needed money, there was green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, not only new hotels have been created in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a marotte that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway enthusiasts.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and self-propelled narrow track tracks to the sugar mills.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and this is how you see clean and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have long been in the museum.
Tour destinations
The most important places do not leave the majority of visitors to Cuba.
So you no longer have to write in detail about Varadero or Havana.
It remains to be mentioned that in the already mentioned property of Hemingways there is a museum whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rising steeply from the valley floor, gathered fertile soil in their cavities, through which even weathered rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of the cigar factories of Havana.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the TV series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad (country)
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Glory and wealth brought her the trade of slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road that would have connected the area to the rest of the country in the 1950s.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it remained unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the area such as the Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n beach or the "Valley of Sugar Factory".
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which lives after dark, and where the music does not remain silent until morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba, some call it the most beautiful of the island.
Certainly, this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo must overcome high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba was included by UNESCO in its World Heritage List thanks to its untouched nature.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church one shows the cross of Columbus (in fact it was created about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, there are several table mountains, of which El Yunque is known.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain, the bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which many of the descendants of slaves could profess, that over all.
But, as they say, it is better to look with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment, according to the United States, affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO is expected to draft a concrete plan for the coming years, according to Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go according to their ideas, on which the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance on the part of the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, is calling on NATO units to become more active, the UK sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
“In Afghanistan, forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the residents to begin even a further development of the economy and security," said British Defence Minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years, according to the U.S. Army.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern Helmand province even by sixty percent.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have hit an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
“We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them,” Gates said.
Similarly, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
"I am not happy with what we have available in Afghanistan to land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," De Hoop told Reuters to conclude three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
Among the countries involved, there has also been a dispute over whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best in recent months.
For example, Germany was criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting demands for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The British boulevard newspaper "Sun" this week referred to the German soldiers as foul fur.
"Afghan non-students hide: The Germans are making games while our boys are fighting," the "Sun" wrote in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper went on to counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
Every Czech Republic has a state debt of 84,000 kroner.
Total debt rose to NOK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of the state budget policy.
The government debt of the Czech Republic rose to NOK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have dropped by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on the state debt from the beginning of October.
Every Czech Republic has a debt of 84,000 kroner.
Over the past year, the state owed more than 111 billion kroner.
"Until now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not be able to exceed the limit of a trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year, the debt should move between 900 billion and one trillion crowns,” said David Marek, analyst at Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, said: “To exceed a billion, we could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly, it depends on the next budget we don’t know yet.
If it should show that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could take up to 2010.
But I’m not going to accept such a change,” he said.
Debts are growing
The state debt stems from the debts of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
The government debt is financed by tax credits, government debt securities, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds from the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt has soared to NOK 719.4 billion this year.
The state's foreign debt has now increased by SEK 1.7 billion to SEK 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached NOK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by NOK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
“Over the year from the first to the third quarter, total debt rose by 13 percent, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the growth is to be recorded especially in the debt prescriptions, where the growth is 20 percent.
It’s bad that the debt is going up, but on the other hand, this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes,” Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the handling of public debt for 2007 shows that the government had planned for this year to raise NOK 159.2 billion.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to NOK 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of the state budget policy.
This amount is mainly due to the state budget deficit, which is expected to reach NOK 76 billion this year instead of the estimated NOK 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, this is the maximum planned funding for the consolidation agency of NOK 13.3 billion, a 10 billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government debt appropriations of NOK 43 billion and the rates for the bonds with the European Investment Bank of Milli of 1.8 million.
Because she gave a name to a teddy bear, today she was presented to a court in Khartoum.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been accused of insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and subsequently deported.
The British was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name of Muhammad, although any depiction of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She would have deserved to be executed.
After parents of students complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture several times, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher, who worked at Unity High School in Khartoum, was taken home on Sunday and, according to Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, was charged with insulting Islam.
In fact, this issue begins in September, when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reported school principal Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common surname in Sudan.
Afterwards, the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the image signature My Name is Mohammed.
The bear himself did not bear a sign with this name, but the problem is quite simple that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew her well, and she would never have done anything that would make her come too close to a religious faith, I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name and to vote for his era.
An opinion shared by numerous students of the teacher who describe them as being very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks about religion in the class.
It should be borne in mind that the first name Mohammed is also the second most commonly given second name in the UK, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of homage to the prophets (it is often given to the first-born of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiation session in Vienna on Wednesday.
At the end of the failure
On Wednesday morning, Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversies about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not come to any agreement on the status, European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart, Frank Wilsner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to comply with their commitments to maintain peace, and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, suggesting that there are definitely clear tensions.
End of the investigation on 10 December
The Troika mediators, which unite the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and final negotiating session since the Troika last August, when the United Nations had received the mandate of a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation order to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo’s independence from the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
Russia has been and remains a proponent of a negotiated solution, an agreed solution, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
One-sided Declaration of Independence?
After Kosovo has been under the administration of the UN for eight years, the Western countries hold independence under the supervision of the EU for the only solution with a future.
Pristina is willing to announce this unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favor.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Regrettably, no agreement could be reached, the President of the Autonomous Authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where since Monday these negotiations have been held of last chance.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However, he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade belongs to the autonomy of a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, believed that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it particularly has a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be made solely and solely in the Security Council, where their Russian allies have a veto right.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the ranks of the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu replied that Kosovo’s parliament will have the last word regarding the status, and added that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population will expire in accordance with the Western countries.
Bush Unlocks Agreement Between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which had gathered under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel must stop its colonization efforts, Bush said, reminding both parties of their commitments to the peace roadmap they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas ultimately aim for a peace treaty that should resolve all open issues without exception, and including the central issues.
This designation includes the three major problems that are mainly the focus of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees displaced from their homelands in the course of the 1948 conflict.
After the American president, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the upcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a regime for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert, for his part, took the floor, he pledged that the upcoming cease-fire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption, and that he would make an effort to bring them to an end by the end of 2008.
Bush has set a deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states, a Palestinian and an Israeli that stand side by side, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received assurances from Bush in this sense from Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has led a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a path of separation in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi Arabian prince said in an interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily newspaper.
According to the attorney general, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors face off.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the initial results of the investigations of the National Police Disciplinary Authority (IGPN), a police car drove on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m.
He did not have a bet, but was on stripe, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, a police spokesman said.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without permission, so not released for public transport (see below), came, driven by two youths without helmet, touched at a very high speed.
It hit the left side of the police car after it had missed its lead from the right, a police officer said.
The alcohol control performed by the vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the car (punched elbows, split windshield, broken bumper) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the public prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se de Givry, announced that she entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of involuntary manslaughter and the lack of assistance to persons at risk", in coordination with the main
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the public prosecutor stated that she excludes the responsibility of the police officers to determine the IGPN at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small-power bike has relatively quickly reached its left side.
Yesterday showed some sort of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, that the two vehicles had remained stuck together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical evaluation.
The bodies of the two victims were mutilated yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel quickly made a rumor that the police would have left the scene of the accident very quickly, and that without the help of the two youths.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious errors in this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigations, for which further investigations are necessary, and in which one must proceed very carefully.
Libération met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness says.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman hanging.
Two others tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth phoned.
Given the tension that had quickly formed around the incident and, it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken into the car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
Still according to this witness statement, the rescue forces came in about twenty minutes after the police left.
They also used heart massages, but unsuccessfully.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police force did not help the youth.
These young people were first aided.
The fire department arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the attorney-at-law emphasized.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police staged the first demonstrations since General Musharraf had declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the emergency were injured by the tear gas grenades used by the law enforcement forces there.
They then threw stones with which they injured the police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers for the Supreme Court’s attorneys have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of around 500 arrests by opposition activists, human rights defenders and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations had taken place in Multan (Middle) and Peshawar (Northeast).
The advocacy movement on Monday received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the emergency, and to send a musk of waste to those who have been evicted.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
He had to refer in the following days to the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on October 6.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate of the newspaper The News stated.
Pervez Musharraf’s pledge to surrender the army’s top command and become a civilian president is no longer valid since the emergency was called, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
It was expected that he would issue his military uniform by November 15, the date on which his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the elections could be postponed from January.
In addition, the Pakistani government debunked the rumours that President Musharraf had been given a place of residence by his deputy military leader.
More than a third of pregnancies are still not planned
This calculation takes into account the undesired pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the undesired pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which finds that the percentage of pill users between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception still allows for better control of fertility.
At least eight out of ten births are now carefully planned.
For one in five couples even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to get a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have spent more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a faulty solar collector that is indispensable for the continuation of the scientific work on the station.
A daring departure, which due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools designed by the astronauts to carry out the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had downloaded the Harmony module from the Space Shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that will soon take on the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
So the second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5-ton module for generating electricity via solar collectors, which was already on the ISS, to bring it into its final position.
After she had set it up, the crew made themselves the restructuring of the module’s solar collectors, whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be unfolded like accordions, was damaged by a clamped cable about a meter in length.
The restructuring was halted to prevent further damage to the collector.
The astronauts, who originally left the space shuttle Discovery for a control flight and then had to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-meter long remote arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skilled, he has a well developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old learned physician was thus selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After he had carefully examined the damage, he severed the faulty cable and secured some sort of rail on the damaged spot.
He was supported by a second Spacewalker, who remained near the lock, and, from within, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey bat, wrapped with an insulator, to prevent electric shock on the solar collectors, which generate several hundred volts, had the astronauts on board the station designed and equipped.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector had fully folded before counting down his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation, before today seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery, expected to take the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the Aviation and Defence Group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counter the A400M’s remnants, the EADS stock is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 with reference to the only slow-moving development of the engine of the A400M, which delay the aircraft’s maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft are between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, more than one billion of which is for Airbus, the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results on Thursday, he added without further details.
The group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month residual.
To be recalled, EADS’ operating performance fell by 86% in 2006, significantly due to the cost associated with the delay of another program, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
The group had originally planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army for October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
On Sunday, it will not be exciting in counting the urns: the mass of Russians will decide for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
After a very tight election campaign, she confirms her quest for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message broadcast on the public broadcasters to the voters, who have already been recorded, but whose contents are kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything go by when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was pleased to provide a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of meddling - his favorite subject during the election campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have been there.
It sparks an election campaign marked by repression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Yeltsin.
After suppressing the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder has been sentenced to five days in jail for illegal demonstrations, according to his lawyer, continuing to be banned from visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovietus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two much more questions arise:
Who will be Putin’s successor as president?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first presidential election, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin is unable to run for a third consecutive term.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party United Russia, which will elect the government and president?
Whatever it is, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the current power will triumph.
This is tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovietus, they are not master of their fate, according to sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of Saint Petersburg even goes even further back: Civil society has only developed very slowly in this country, which has been Christianized to Europe for five centuries; the famous spirit of community has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin once again linked to the model of a paternalistic state, which was completely adopted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians, from free pieces, give up the personal responsibility they have put on the day shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
Why think about it for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands to keep the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional presidents) run the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as they were in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What else do you think about for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad as to replace them?
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidential treatment, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, documenting the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed in a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be seen until now, except with a humanitarian intention, that is, individual and name-related, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his relatives.
The eleven states entrusted with their administration, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed in May 2006 to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable research to be carried out, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the state of health of forced workers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which will be chaired by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CI).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public, due to the delicate nature of certain information.
Such as, for example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental handicap of some deportation victims.
The prisoner lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been compiled for a practical reason after the war: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with a means of proof of their arrest, in order to give them the way to their emancipation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of personal requests.
However, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in accessing Bad Arolsen.
One must not expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India are seeking a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s main trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said the European Union and India hoped to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU foreign ministers had given the European Commission a green light last April to open negotiations to sign Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with mutual trade between India and Europe already reaching the 60-millennium mark.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to European Commission figures, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will advance the two economies enormously, and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
The European Commissioner said that the Asian and European giants exchange goods worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion each year and services worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 billion each, while the European Commission did not have the right to exchange goods and services in the amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 billion each year.

The Bank of England takes note of the unrest and offers <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England showed concern about curbing the current recurring concern over credit conditions, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion offer with a base interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate the fears that financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organize their liquidity positions during this time, the Bank intends to initiate a significant part of their savings during the 6th quarter of the year.
The bank further states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation on December 6 at 12.15 GMT, at the basic tax rate and only until January 10.
This seems to be the first time that BoE is rolling out liquidity for five weeks in an open-market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
BoE adds in its communication that it is prepared to take further measures to obtain the different interest rates of interbank lending at their base rate from day to day.
The interbank interest rate varied from day to day on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate has fallen to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis of the summer, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with fines that the banks had refrained from using.
According to certain rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank at more advantageous interest rates and with more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS’s proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text, which was created in the context of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping), gave rise to about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the PS National Committee, most of them 50% for the addition of employment, for the reintroduction of the TPP floating, for a transport check or for a transport check.
After the UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to some harsh word changes between the majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution about purchasing power.
The leader of the MPs of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of finances, which had been reviewed by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“It’s an honor for our company to work with a person who has served, no more and no less, as a role model for the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The head of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever been to, says his company and Melvin Benn are working side by side to offer the area a European-style festival event.
We have selected Philadelphia as a market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We held negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Regrettably, we have remained stuck in policy debates regarding the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Luckily, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are meeting preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at the Grand Park Chicago, having profiled itself in the world of the festival together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The two events were each able to achieve $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in gross tax days.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
“The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours are more likely to take place on urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
"The goal is to merge these two concepts in one way or another to convey the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban way in the American way at the same time."
Vineland is approximately halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the Mayor, takes the burden of this event with pleasure,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to award the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are interesting enough to invest in such an event and record a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s recording capacity is “very large,” according to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed when they were printed.
“Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who have received the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It’s not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no one is less than the Terminator.
These lock tests are part of the delegate’s tasks.
A politically "heavy mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, appeals to "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "Governor"?
“You have to be careful, because it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who are considered to be the best,” he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the advancement of the local cinema is currently a top priority.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals on the West Coast, although Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them, and making sure the producers are giving interviews.
The dark era had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market ahead of a year-end rally? Disagreement among experts due to the U.S. mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks until the annual close on the stock exchange, investors are already shaking hands with regard to the upcoming end-of-year rally.
However, experts are not able to make safe forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the stock market usually coincides with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially then, if too serious tensions determine the current market situation
Although other experts do not favor such a strong price increase in the last weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participant. These invest to secure equity funds is mainly due to the trustworthiness of pension funds.
As a result, in the opinion of these experts, the stock market will have a rather lateral trend, influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the U.S. note bank, an uncertainty that is to be attributed, above all, to the increased rise in crude oil.
Javier Barrio, head of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a bold time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its highest mark on November 8 of 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional, annual pension fund grant at this time.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could develop somewhat differently; especially because of the end-of-year rally taking place already in the second week of December, and therefore directly after the bridge day to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous assessments of the market situation are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values, the extent of which may soon differ from the consequences of the US mortgage market.
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
When selecting the values to drive the Ibex to a new maximum, the analysts agree.
Solana of Intermoney argues that this year’s big values are in line.
Among the value winners, the expert would count the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha from Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be associated with the banking and industrial sector.
If the rally actually succeeds, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on a recovery course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, the expert said.
With regard to the increased consumption behavior during the Christmas days, the market will be determined in the last half of the year by the periodical consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only shown declining course rates in two cases.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-of-year rally so far.
This year, when the Ibex 35 picked up by 28.17 percentage points, December saw a 6.68% price increase.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex has been up by 8.36%) since January and can also show a final year rally will show itself.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open from Monday to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economically active regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a large milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular is the first banking group dares to extend the opening hours of its branches from weekdays to 8:30 p.m. and to start on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
The BBVA banking group, which also repeatedly relied on the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet reached a definitive decision.
The Bank’s ongoing negotiations with the unions seem to be aimed at an agreement in which 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open on a weekday afternoon, if not for the customer.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening times, will depend on the experience values of Popular Bank.
And that is exactly the intention that Popular pursues with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which, due to their location, can capture the purchase-intensive customer base of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new, but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones and at the same time match the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of the opening hours is associated with a new spatial design of the branches, which is distinguished by a more up-to-date, colour-cool design.
The responsible bank representative <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require greater investment, but coincided with an increased staffing position, as a branch now needed no more six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, according to <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The offices of the streets Bravo Murillo, O’Donell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a have been chosen for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently runs about 2500 branches.
And another 60, which operate under the name Mundocredit, specializing in immigrants and also featuring extended opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to compete for our customers, Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have provisionally come to an agreement to sell mobile phones using external banking staff.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its market value for the first time, surpassing its rivals Antena 3.
We did it.
With this set, the CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The channel he led had increased its value by twice the value of his rival Antena 3.
But one aspect dampened his joy: that’s exactly what hurt me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they did not sink too deep.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses so far this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company’s value now reaches 4,488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento only 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has a total loss of 40.5% since January, bringing its market value to 2,193.46 million.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communications companies is increasing; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in Prisa (the publisher of the magazine Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) to 2,518.53 million and in Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that these are two similar companies, according to Vasile.
The question still arises to what extent we can actually act on the stock market, at what price and how we can make it profitable at the customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its plan to launch its first TV channel this year with more than 1000 million gross revenue from advertising revenue, which was insured by Guiseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the group’s advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965,4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock market (up to 734.4 million), while net revenues from the TV business could only have an increase of 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for Telecinco’s better stock exchange history is the high payout ratio that the company has been able to have so far: in 2006, the company, led by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a, generated a 100 percent dividend payout.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio after the purchase of 33% of Endemol shares, with Mediaset as parent company, could still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have so far indicated significantly more.
I hope we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose stock values we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market is currently experiencing some loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% and from 5.5% in 2009 to 5.1%.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and by 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buying) has a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (holding) due to the multiple incentives and the thriving market.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends resetting expectations in both cases in the face of similar threats (saturated market and poorer economic climate)
The Congress approves the MIFID directive, which came into force on November 1.
In parallel with the parliamentary drafting, which ended its session today with the Congressional resolution in the Senate on the amendments to the draft, the government published the provisions emanating from the new law with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the congressmen and senators who had pursued in their negotiations and votes the goal of establishing the best possible regulation that guarantees the safety of investors and regulates the activities of individual entrepreneurs.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, the MIFID, which redefines the Securities Services Regulation, seeks to improve investor protection, to increase the control requirement of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and to promote cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive makes it possible to offer financial advice to both specialised companies and natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the creation of new financial services companies (ESIS) to the consulting companies that combine with the investment and brokerage companies of securities.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, so that the multilateral systems of the effects business and the systems for the internationalisation of trading orders are added to the regulated circulation markets, which would eventually enter into competition with the current economic players.
The law obliges investment firms to declare the focus of their corporate profile, the confrontation and forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Economic Commission of the Congress subsequently made further changes, with the decision that the debt prescription with titles now have to be considered as a complex financial means for the investor due to its high degree of risk, confirmed by the U.S. mortgage and banking crisis.
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the Legal Limitation of the Work Areas of Graduate Economists was used; 30 years after 1977, the Regulation, which restricted the work areas reserved for economists, was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator, who works on a foreign basis, does not require authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialization of products and for the acquisition of customers at the same time several investment companies.
The Harmonized Consumer Price Index (VPI) rose by five-tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator, used by Eurostat to assess inflation rates within the European Union, provides the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which, by disclosing the data, aim to compare local and quality products to US products.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared in advance by applying the same procedure as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) cautioned that the pre-determined indicator only serves as a guide value and therefore does not have to match the final result, which will be announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Head of Government and Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes, the rise of the VPI in November was a temporary development; at the same time, he assured that the price index would continue to remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
However, Solbes noted in the halls of the congressional building that even if the current figure is not good, Spain’s inflation difference to the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
In addition, he stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, during which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4% , the Minister of Economy and Finance announced with regard to the forecast published today.
Virgin expects revenues of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion over the next three years with Northern Rock
The value of Northern Rock has fallen by more than half since the Bank requested an emergency loan from the UK bank in mid-September last year due to a crisis, and they are now only <0xC2><0xA3>12.000 million (equivalent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.800 million).
At that time, the bank’s assets amounted to a record-breaking <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, an amount that has declined significantly in two and a half months due to the loss of confidence of customers and also despite the government’s one hundred percent guarantee that the money will continue to be safe until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, will have to bring in about a quarter of the revenues of the British banks, which will consist of the facilities there for the next three years, in order to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that will still be enough to reach their target of 30 billion ben.
Multimillionaire Richard Branson’s group, known for its eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, plans to channel <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, in which three more companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
Totana Mayor Arrested for Suspected Suspect of Participating in Urban Corruption
Spanish police arrested this morning the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular), belonging to the municipality of Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption, which was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo last May represented the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Popular Party and at the time chairman of the municipal council of Totana, and could, according to information from the radio station Cadena SER, be the original wire drawer of the plot.
The officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was charged with the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to information from the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and consequently privileged, MP Juan Morales was arrested when leaving his client's residence due to important burdensome documents that are supposed to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report Morales’ alleged order payments to a Galician construction company, which foresees the conclusion of a city-building contract in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Currently, eight people are in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE’s candidacy in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, according to which he will lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory of the Socialists, the
José Blanco, PSOE’s organizational secretary, and Bono announced it at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place at the party’s headquarters today.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, the politician from the Mancha would probably run for president of the Congress for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n as Congress president, who had announced on November 15 that he would no longer run in the next general election, end his career in public policy, and instead take up his position in the university’s field of climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the president had been continuously pushing for his return to political action.
In addition, he pointed out that the party, as in the appointment of the vice president of economy, does not want to keep citizens out of it, who in the event of an election victory would take over the post of congressional president, and referred to this as an act of transparency.
If he were to actually take office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a house of respect, not of insult or screaming, in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time you get the impression that the only place you can not talk to in Madrid is the Congress, so the President of the Government has been interrupted in the Senate once to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n and his good work and indicated that he did not want to appear to have already taken office, because otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate is subject to merciless criticism by both the climate change skeptics and those who put a social and political debate at the forefront of it, the movement as a whole must maintain a strong cohesion.
Especially when it comes to a leader of the movement, who, like in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal brings him in a note of explanation regarding the actions or non-trading of his government, which has contributed decisively to the fact that Spain is at the top of the EU of the countries that have least met the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are responsible for the non-fulfilment of the requirements, to what sectors this is due to, and why his government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, has not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures he intends to take against climate change without hesitation.
Which companies will be affected, what behavior of citizens should be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures need to be implemented and what economic consequences result from this.
More precisely, who has to sacrifice himself and will pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there is and will be no such declarations in the future.
It’s because it’s about sacrifice and paying.
Because the measures that can be used against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol-cent proposed by the PSOE, Zapatero appeared to be so dangerous in terms of election strategy that he was forced to take the proposal back.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, that is, with pure propaganda and empty slogans without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, Commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the politicians otherwise so suitable for election campaigns must neither speak, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead follow the demanding issue, decorate the meetings and inspire others with his kindness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not indicate that the bike will become the only means of movement in the future or we are only allowed to refresh ourselves with a compartment.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to an alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the Murcia-based town of Totana, the popular politician José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, and the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor’s office and a hotel contractor were also arrested for suspected urban construction violations.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises he is located until the present day, surrounded by numerous agents who had also met with the city administration and the municipal building manager Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the arrests that took place in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid last Monday, in which it was found that more than 2 million hectares of undisclosed building land for urban construction projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria should be converted to land under the supervision of the construction company Nuaria.
In addition, two more persons were not arrested directly, but were subjected to an investigation, which is initiated and carried out by the first court of Totonas.
The first six arrests were presented to the judge today.
According to investigative circles, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP MP Juan Morales are also being investigated.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend residing in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigr<0xC3><0xA1>n (Pontevedra), as well as the CEO of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company acted as part of the Nuaria group and was to receive the rent.
The investigations are carried out by the municipal authority against urban crimes, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven further investigations, most of them in companies directly related to those in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, and Tornandez.
At this time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry breeding business, which is said to have acted as a mediator.
The Nuaria group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the Murcia-owned town, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometres of land in Totana, which was to be rebuilt, with the aim of carrying out a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the car parks of the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and the Preconeza.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the term Book of the Month and instead try to invent a price designation of another name with appropriate competencies.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are cordially invited to submit your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat, published a comment (Finland, by the way, is at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on November 18th; incidentally, on the same day, Black's book from the book
The content of the subject Philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy around the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the gruesome murder is an abiturant who in his messages cited the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, in an interview with the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper, urged teachers to take a more critical stance towards Plato and suggested that Plato’s teaching be spread from the sub-level curriculums for philosophy at high schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. The downloading of a song would be a violation of the law, which would be subject to six months of imprisonment.
However, if, in turn, you rob a music business below a value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft will be considered a criminal offence, however, the penalty will be less than in the case of a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you ask for a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than when you download it (Article 244.1).
D. It is less difficult to participate in a hit than in a music data exchange.
To participate in a rebel struggle, a prison sentence of three to 12 months is imposed (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data results in a six-month to two-year deprivation of liberty.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered to be less bad than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, which has not been authorized by the authors, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague should be right, then someone has screwed up his demands but very nicely.

My GP gives me one of his long, strange research articles titled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when others get more of it.
Thus, the feelings arising from the monthly salary are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was created using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Brain Research Center Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave the right answers and his co-player failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activity always turned out to be very moderate if both participants were right with their response and therefore also got the same pay; but if one of them received the double, it also resulted in a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it actually requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Attorney General from the Balkans
For eight years now, Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing the perpetrators of the Balkan Wars, and her office is located in the prosecutor’s office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a weeping and laughing eye, as the main perpetrators of the massacre of Srebrenica - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed - are the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosnian leader.
Her names are on the list of the director Marcel Sch<0xC3><0xBC>pbach from Switzerland as a template for the title of his documentary film La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that, with the pace of a police thriller, follows the Swiss public prosecutor from Belgrade to New York, follows her on the way to her trial
Which insurance is best for me?
The KFZ insurance, which covers a possible case of damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost expense, the amount of which in turn depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of creation of the driver's license, family status, type of car to be insured and its use.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right KFZ insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, one must be clear about what we are dealing with here.
An auto insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance company.
This Agreement shall be concluded in writing by means of an insurance contract which stipulates that the Company shall receive the agreed insurance premium and, in return, is obliged to provide the corresponding amount of relief in the event of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that consists of several factors, including age, gender, time of creation of the driver's license, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that even higher contribution payments are due in the event of a higher risk of accidents.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women need to make less contribution payments, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same is true for married persons, since, according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the conviction of the companies, they tend to have fewer accidents than single people.
The benefit that is measured to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus also the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequently the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, the insurances must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver also needs to study the situation thoroughly to choose the exact car insurance that meets his personal needs most often.
At this point, we now list the most important points that should be considered when choosing an insurance in order to be able to make not only a performance, but also a price-oriented choice.
Those under the age of 25 are faced with numerous obstacles when choosing a low-priced insurance, such as low driving practice and young driver’s license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance coverage to complete a full-cash insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
Careful drivers can choose a full cascade with self-interest, so that the benefits of a full cascade insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer has to pay part of the amount incurred by the damage itself.
The amount is determined before the conclusion of the contract and based on the amount of the insurance premium. This is higher the lower the amount to be paid , explains Luis Noguera, Spain’s chief representative at First Europe, a brokerage firm for online insurance.
Another option is extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against damage caused by the car itself.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it’s up to you to lower your insurance costs, so your credit will increase by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate at the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes a fee referred to as an increase.
The amount of credits and penalty payments depends on the company and its earnings.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can afford to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for the driver to conclude a contract, due to the fact that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it is most sensible to opt for full casco insurance with self-interest.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish leader of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year after the fear of the beginner has been put off.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to take out a full cash cover insurance; of course, only if it also allows the financial situation of the respective person.
On the insurers’ side, couples with children are considered the customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a fully co-insurance with self-insurance (in the amount of 300 euros) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which is used only for the third year of the vehicle.
They drive overall more relaxed and possess a greater purchasing power, which allows them to set up a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera notes.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out a fully-funded self-insurance (in the amount of 150 euros), or an extended insurance, which is only used in case of a sufficiently high credit.
In the end, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it has high costs that require a thorough selection to be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes to make it to the eighth final in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight for the point in San Siro next Tuesday, which they will miss in order to reach their respective goals before the end of the Champions League preliminary round. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group while the Scots decide on their participation.
The Italian team has already scored five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow needs another with nine points to make sure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not score the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D games will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan must compete at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for the first time in the 13th semi-final to enter the final, which will take place on the 16th.
In this way, this group will be finished above all others and the draw at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium will be the result that is expected everywhere, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtics Glasgow know that in the event of a victory they would lose a group star and thus they would lose out in a defeat to a group star.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even have a defeat in a draw of FC Shakhtar to qualify. However, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because with nine points equal, the Ukrainians are allowed to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-2), but lost two games (2-2).
Thus, the Milanese will try to miss the Scots in the evening. They hope to reach the eighth final of the redesignated Champions League for the second time in a row, after being knocked out by a goal from Kaka in the post-game period (1-0) and now by a quarter-final.
While FC Shakhtar is waiting for the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the eighth final and joining UEFA will depend on his victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
Despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could reach third place by a win and thus play at UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls performed in Vancouver, Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 spectators on the opening shot for their first tour after the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) announced just before the start of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium that the band had returned to the stadium.
Around 20,000 people were able to experience the concert at the sold-out stadium, where a video of the band’s history, which had sparked outrage in the late 1990s, was shown.
The reunification and world tour coincide with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and Voodoo, and which will be released in Spain under the EMI label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden bracelets on the stage, which had previously been given to them by the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowds in the audience who brought the GM Palace to the fore, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham announced that the British star had not seen our wardrobe once, and that is why I am already really looking forward to what he will think of the performance.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal differences of opinion two years later pulled the band's breakup, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press conference.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world’s public had changed, that the feelings for the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought why not; so I'm glad to have made that decision," Chisholm said of the band's breakup nine years ago.
The singer also said that the disputes had been resolved and that everyone would like to see each other again.
However, many things have changed since the Spice Girls’ last joint appearance in 1998.
First of all, according to a report by CTV, the group arrived in a special Virgin Airlines machine in Vancouver.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of baby girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7).
In Madrid, they will enter the stage on December 23.
New fears about the Russian-Ukrainian natural gas dispute
A new price dispute is brewing between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
Most of Russia’s natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is very closely observed.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for the natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
An earlier conflict between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be charged more, as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine has to pay 40% more for imports from Gazprom.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks,” Ukraine’s Economy Minister Anatoli Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changing gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom shortened deliveries to Ukraine.
This resulted in a fall in exports to Western Europe, which drove prices up dramatically.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s supply.
Russia has the world’s largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own supplies of gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS “must control foreign workers”
The Scottish State Health Service needs to improve checks on pre-registries for workers from outside Europe, a member of the supervisory body said.
The recommendation of Chief Financial Controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in connection with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish State Health Service had no precise idea of the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The chief financial controller examined staff recruited outside the European Economic Area (EEA) countries as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a land vehicle was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission in Old Bailey in October and was charged in connection with the alleged car bomb attack in the UK.
The State Health Service is expected to carry out checks in advance of hiring foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to check pre-trial records, the Agency does not have the authority to receive this information outside the UK.
The report of the Chief Auditor now states, among other recommendations, that the Executive Board should take up guidelines on criminal records, which helps employers in checks in different countries.
“Although we found evidence of these controls in some personnel records, they were not routinely performed,” the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their pre-employment investigation guidelines to a high degree, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information about the number of foreign health care workers is available."
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations ahead of hiring potential NHS employees would identify people who might commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that current NHS Scotland pre-tests are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the Financial Controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the Boards would have trouble identifying those employees who are allowed to work indefinitely.
The investigation further found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian had been largely complied with.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign personnel in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was my concern to carry out this work in view of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines regarding control investigations in the run-up to the recruitment of all employees would reflect, among other things, the following:
Joy Division dominates film award ceremony
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including for the best film.
Awards were also given to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and deputy actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded the Best Actress for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing the British film to the public.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film – on its soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order – was shot for just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
Nevertheless, he has brought two awards to Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known so far for the cult cover of U2 album Joshua Tree - as the best director and the best director's debut.
Rock music was the centerpiece of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary film.
The award for best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg’s London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who is famous for playing hard guys, has won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nile by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named in honour of the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
“There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He’s my type of person, a great actor of his time, I’m really honored.”
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia over terror plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for their affiliation to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil facility as well as on clerical and security forces.
The world’s largest oil exporter’s state television said one of the cells had planned to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaida supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, was planning an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid-fire force to protect the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006 after a failed Al Quaida attack on plants.
The report, referring to an interior ministry statement, says 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a “missile expert” who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of those arrested were planning to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clerics to do more to stop Saudis seeking to join forces with Al Qaeda militias that want to fight the allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shiite Muslim government, which are seen by hardliners among Sunni Saudis as heretical.
Al Qaeda militias consider many clerics in Saudi Arabia to be in co-operation with the authorities in support of the royal family policy that the government dominates.
The militias – accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader to target the pro-Western Saudi government – have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This has been a very big effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman for the interior ministry told state television.
The arrests also involved a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote the "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims who are branded as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were also 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could provide a glimpse into the future of the Earth
Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft on a orbit show that the planet is even more like a distant twin of the Earth than it was previously aware of.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Billions of years ago, conditions would have prevailed on Venus, which would have been very similar to those on Earth and could have even been habitable, scientists believe today.
But due to the unbraked carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar irradiation and a slower rate of rotation, Venus entered a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strength winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which has been studying the plants for a year, provide a sobering look at how the Earth could evolve in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the head of the Venus Express mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
“Our new data allow us to construct a scenario in which Venus started billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment.”
"Enhanced uranium" seized by police
A kilogram of radioactive material, reportedly enriched with uranium, was seized by Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesman said three people had been arrested and that the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds).
Everything is still open
Mitt Romey said he does not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency ultimately declared himself ready to face a debate on YouTube, in which normal voters take questions to video and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman, who questioned Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time exactly reflected the state of the Republican Party, which will break out in the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who selected the debate with the support of those who supported YouTube Clips to show the upcoming candidates.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, immigration was at the center.
This is one of the most important issues for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of indecisive voters to serve a ballot box when they heard things they liked: The TV station noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke strictly across the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who has moved forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the reputation that he has been proficient in illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly fiercely opposed to each other as respondents asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to address this issue.
Neither of the two men have serious chances at the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they’ve ridden on the immigration trail earlier and harder than others.
At least in the field of immigration, the candidates share in large and all the same views: tighter borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, help Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic as other issues were brought to the fore.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not believe the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – now against all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed about whether Jesus would support her, he laughed about it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee’s rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul’s recent donation successes and his storms in Wednesday’s debate.
These two have been shot out of nowhere, because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party from the beginning and convincingly combined with a victorious message about the size of America and a twinker to both wings of the party.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another pit for invading; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slender.
No titles seem to be sold, no politician pays Paris hotel bills, no extramarital toes have been evicted.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has hidden donations for the British ruling Labour Party over <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 (1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something that the struggling Gordon Brown would have done well without.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had withdrawn from the demand for an election, in a foolish way insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinion polls would not have influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly shrewd chairman of the Liberal Democrats, expressed, the once-feared Brown of Stalin has evolved into Mr. Bean.
The unscathed rescue of Northern Rock, a battered bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgmental ability under fire.
Poorly thought out proposals to change tax laws have put corporate associations against the government.
The tax administration’s loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative poaching.
A trio of retired generals launched an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: to be a minister of the armed forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s secretary-general (and her former chief executive) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown irrevocably breaks down toward resignation.
Yet governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it is impossible to govern.
People don’t like or trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new troop takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for a long time, this postponement is over: the public service is starting to get out of hand; the cabinet ministers are starting to talk; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is going to lose.
In a way, Brown’s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new beast.
As much as he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant colonel.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax liability documents, for example, are linked to decisions made by Brown as the Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn’t directly involved in Blair’s misbehavior — as in the long “money for nobility” investigation of political party funding — voters may assume it was.
Still, Brown's situation isn't quite as bad as it looks
The mistakes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one has died, or been completely deceived.
And the opposite, as painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new witness for political donations is a good example.
The Garboesque Abraham, who compares his donations to his charitable gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his well-being.
This may be the case, but the decision was not up to him.
The anti-anonymity laws for major political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who says he would have known about Abraham’s agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendleson, Labour’s chief financial officer, who was told about the extraordinary donations in October.
But so far Brown has not been involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his takeover in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered down this determination by resorting to a known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject—led to make the measure complete, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the “lessons to draw from” are not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it's a matter for the police.
Other than that, there are other things Mr. Brown needs to do, like something to find a permanent chairman of the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, who has been unemployed for six months, and to move forward with a comprehensive reform of political party funding.
That would require Labour’s hardliners to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly abandon the special financial relationship with the unions – bitter pills for a party ally like Mr. Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through unquestionable fairness and solid competence.
Kartenhaie
Is the credit crisis in America’s credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural for the back to swirl excitedly.
Now that America’s real estate market is shrinking, the predators are targeting the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer loans.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both book-outs and interest rates that measure the proportion of loans that are not recoverable in each case or more than 30 days too late.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its U.S. consumer funding, in part due to the weakness of credit cardholders.
It’s still too early to panic.
Losses and bruises are still low.
According to Moody’s rating agency, the third-quarter seeding rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in U.S. private insolvency laws in 2005 resulted in an abrupt case of bankruptcy filings, which in turn account for a large part of the chain card losses; the number of filings (and thus seed fees) would increase again, whether or not the general conditions for borrowers deteriorated.
The industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month.
and the trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stagnation in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the 2007 spending will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infection channels between the property credit crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers are more likely to take credit card debt, now that home loans are drying out.
However, the card issuers look at the cash flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower’s creditworthiness.
They can even be of benefit to card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates decrease when the properties are of less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among the repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also react much faster and more flexibly than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid reassessment of assets.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and reassess the loans completely,” said Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial officer.
Even if a sudden cover-up crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a credit reduction push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep an eye out for these shark fins.
British banks plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers, who were to be brought to court for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, on Wednesday, changed their search into guilt.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocent for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications means for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was set for January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Attorney Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications means.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were announced in the UK during two-year delivery procedures.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The charges originally filed against her in 2002 drew Fastow's attention to the fact that he was the target of a government investigation in connection with the Enron downturn.
The indictment against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims they came to Houston in 2000 to hack a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron controlled by Fastow, the architect of countless fraudulent Enron ventures that helped tear the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its stake in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had considerable value.
A company under Kopper’s control acquired the bank’s shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid copper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely told Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But actually the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Copper and others declined about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in Enron's lawsuit.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison sentence in Louisiana's federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on foot due to a $1 million bail that made it necessary for them to live in the United States awaiting trial.
Enron, once the nation’s seventh-largest company, broke into bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer conceal the billions of debt or make weaker businesses appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value, and more than two billion dollar pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year of their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling is punishable by more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges became null after he died last year of heart disease.
Not quite below in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But this is a small sum for some of the rich Russians.
“It can accommodate up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But none of you ask for so many seats because it’s for a private family or a corporate president.”
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaires’ Exhibition, a four-day Orgy of Shown Consumption, which was held in a shady exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury exhibitors had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest newly minted Russians in everything from Mahogany-plated yachts to diamond-coated car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully took on a shiny orange Porsche at the next booth.
“This is a nice car, but it’s a small amount of money compared to us,” he said.
According to the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems so flooded with money like Dallas at its peak.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in scissors where they were seen as materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerged as the world’s most visible free-lance money issuer.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, attracted to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who own a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian second-class millionaires, worth a total of $670 billion, belong, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the existential minimum.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had for the first time visited the fair together with the Russian retailer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
“Women are all exemplary, and men are all worth a fortune.”
As they pull through the halls on Sunday night in evening clothes, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, describe themselves and their clients as millionaires.
“I looked at the cars and I was trying to decide between the infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothing she was wearing, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed to focus primarily on the newcomers, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand for several hours to visit a busy warehouse, the tasteless Cadillac Escalades, pocket knives made of platinum, maverick elves
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climbers."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brand with limited numbers that would not market at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, messengers of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Betten, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, said a company outfitted the high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customises luxury cars to customers, said he would have sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which are the same chain-arms, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, making it look like a roulette wheel.
Cost: $22,000 for a four-pronged replacement.
“The Russian millionaire, who wants to have an image of his wife’s face made of cubic zirconia, will not necessarily ride on these wheels,” Mr. Karapetian said.
"He will keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian Millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if you’re not already in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least do as if they were rich at a stand operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells according to the British model, which were stuffed with mountains of fake million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 fake bank notes for the Millionaire’s Fair.
Passants stopped tossing around the piles of money, mobile phone photos, as they leaned back in the middle of the replacement wealth, being cut by friends, or just to plug in a few million.
“Look, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Mr. Karryev said.
Confused operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before the Thanksgiving as Ronald Livingston watched through the big glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as a ambulance stopped two doors down at the white Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the box car of the medical examiner arrive," Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, said on Wednesday.
“That was the point when I knew someone had died.”
Authorities learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now, investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure carried out by an unapproved cosmetic surgeon who was not identified by the police and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
Authorities have yet to determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo’s death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, whose results may not be available for weeks, will help clear up a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the top of the Newark police force.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the Director of Police, Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and hard-working," McCarthy said of Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my Pitbull.
She protected me.”
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was pronounced dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have not communicated much about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine if a part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro’s house, where a rusty rose bush stands in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian bells behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading into the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him find his way into the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this or that one,’” he said.
“She was always here when I arrived and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to an increase in world stock markets
Shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market openings that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest cuts were bolstered by weighty comments from the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the central bank, said the policy had to respond "flexible and pragmatically" to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm sad markets in the face of signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence had “partially reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October.”
If increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further tightening financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilise credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The executions also helped calm Wall Street in the face of further bad news from the U.S. economy, now that U.S. real estate sales reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence have been underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that they will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their worldwide workers, in a cost-reduction measure to remove serious losses from their lost bets in the US mortgage.
It is expected that only 20 of these locations in London, where the bank employs 1,500 employees, will disappear.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of British standard values.
Germany’s index Dax rose 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Previously, the reemergence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantee funds from the European Central Bank granted to the European commercial banks was granted to a considerable 4.7 per cent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow up and feed more capital into the money markets in London increased as credit tensions rose to the three-month "Libor" rates for lending between UK banks by 6.59 percent at their highest since late September, falling to a late September.
England Faces Decision on Statements by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of which is almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be the number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, on call, at least under this special title, is here to help the head coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan decide on it, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, does not always belong to the national team, if he is a member of the board of directors.
Whoever does not get the sixth batting position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and the sport is undoubtedly it.
It is never easy to pinpoint exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his or her career path, while someone else never goes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes out of lack of luck instead of ability.
It’s not just in cricket where selection is difficult, where judgments are needed that are always subjective in the end.
When is the best time to visit Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah when he does?
The same may also be asked in another area whether, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good degrees who know the business well should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricketer unless he is given the opportunity to swim or undergo.
Of course, numbers have a big impact on decisions, but chances are, too.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a batsman must get regular chances on the order when he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the voters is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, when James Anderson, who will apparently play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind rolls into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their points of view and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it may make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the time was still struggling to solidify, who made the breakthrough to a major Test cricketer and who is still going to score a double in Australia against Australia.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, following a further discussion in the course of today’s online session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and abdominal feelings for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara’s youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay speak, 43 top-notch hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is 22 years younger, and an excellent balance against cornered ball.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the Test in Lord, his home arena as a Middlesex player, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection of the voters as Vaughan, was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken off the swing from his swing.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has the joy of life.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket pitch and his attitude was taken away from it when he had recently overtaken a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had been watching this from afar, and say with enthusiasm, “Did you see that?”
Bopara is a much better field player, he constricts his midfield with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to suit him and strikes with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps this is the true art of choice.
I’m inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn’t mean that Shah may not be well if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he’s the one who’s going to play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons running out of funds or visas, and others hoping the city would return to normalcy.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At Mansour Bus Station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operated by refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now.”
They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militias of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be put back at the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime did not allow him to work.
His Shi’ite neighbors in Amariyah called on him to tell him that a local US-backed militia helped drive al-Qaida out of its bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven out of his house in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after calling on his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-al-Qaida militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That’s why I came back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the rise of U.S. troops and the growth of local "groups affected citizens" who were armed and, in cooperation with the U.S. military, defended their neighborhoods.
But more spoke of being forced home due to visa problems and money laundering in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister who had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled the sectarian death squads in the country.
“We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis not to give visas anymore to force them to return to Iraq,” he said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left.”
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were expelled from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have left behind.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and there will be conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one area of education do the Saarlanders have the same deficit as the rest of the country.
“Yesterday, for the 50th time, I declared to a non-Aarlander that we are not French” – this slogan is self-ironically placated by the smallest federal state on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is ranked fifth in the educational monitor of the Institute of German Economy Cologne (IW).
In this way, the universities already cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbr<0xC3><0xBC>cken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high with 15.6 percent.
But even the rural children bring Saarland in an above-average number to the universities - many of them without a degree in high school.
“In Saarland, the vocational education system is used,” says Axel Pl<0xC3><0xBC>nnecke, an education expert at IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their right to study at a vocational school, so Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combined possibilities of vocational and academic training are also comparatively greatly expanded.
Measured by the population, the equipment with dual degree programs is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
“After the first Pisa study, we initiated a number of reforms at the general education schools,” says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
For the children to start learning early, the last year of Kita is free of charge - a model that now also copies other federal states.
Whether the students’ performance will improve sustainably will only show future comparative studies.
At Pisa 2003, the share of risk students decreased from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Saarland did not rise as strongly as other federal states.
The Bavarians are better off.
And to the detriment of the Saarlanders, foreign language skills at Pisa are not measured - in this area one could score otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbors is compulsory in high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez turns the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks will tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez lets the timers in the South American country turn back by half an hour.
In Spain, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is a joke.
According to Venezuela’s Official Gazette, according to a new law, the clocks on the world time are set minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez justified his decision, among other things, that the United States of the world would impose the division into full-time zones.
In addition, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced on Wednesday (local time) that relations with neighboring Colombia would be terminated due to a rumoured affair.
The left-wing nationalist said, as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not maintain relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is pushing for constitutional reform, about which the citizens of the oil country must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The cause of the dispute was the decision by Uribe to remove Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez from the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which involved the release of hostages.
Uribe, with his decision, "spelled in the face", criticized Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez on Sunday.
Even in Spain, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is everywhere.
A new phone ringtone in the country provides for furore: "Por que no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the phrase that has already been downloaded by more than half a million people from the Internet.
He was addressed by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who was annoyed by the leftist’s constant interrogatives at the recent Ibero-America summit and had run over his mouth.
Germany threatens 2007 pay gap
Despite the strong economy, German workers are at risk of a real wage loss this year, according to a forecast.
Experts called a whole host of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-B<0xC3><0xB6>ckler-Stiftung, employees in 2007 could actually expect less on the payroll than in the previous year.
“This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in value added tax and the price increase in food and energy,” said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the “Image” newspaper.
New burdens could also come on workers when it comes to unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck told the "New Osnabr<0xC3><0xBC>ck newspaper" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year is correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not again be embarrassed to ask the federal for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products drove the inflation rate to the highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices increased by 3.0 per cent year-on-year.
Venus is the Hellish Twin of the Earth
The Venus is thought to be more similar to the Earth’s life-affirming atmosphere than ever before: the European spacecraft Venus Express has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind gusts on the Poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it flashes on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided evidence - it felt electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The flashes on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the Science Magazine.
According to the famous "supplement theory", lightning has created life on Earth: thunderstorms are said to have triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: “If there ever was life there, it must have been in very early history,” says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the devil's twin of the earth, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has entered such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the early 1990s there has been no probe specifically designed to explore this planet.
The latest research findings, which are now presented in several "nature" articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, according to the researchers.
“They also show that the similarities between our neighboring planet and Earth are greater than initially assumed,” Esa said.
In addition to the already well-known vortex wind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the Earth’s winter climate, writes a research team about Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The solar system’s second-tallest planet has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening stars, orbits the sun in about 225 days.
However, it is much slower around itself: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar barely resembles the Earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
Water was collected on both of them, which remained on Earth in the oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonate rocks on Earth, it makes up the majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
K<0xC3><0xB6>hler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President K<0xC3><0xB6>hler calls for an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor’s Office.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst K<0xC3><0xB6>hler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and has called on the big coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama’s reception.
“We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler told the trade magazine.
At the same time, K<0xC3><0xB6>hler signaled understanding for the Dalai Lama’s reception by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but Merkel took refuge from the accusation that she is pursuing a new China policy.
“The Federal Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his displeasure at the Dalai Lama’s reception and had therefore been attacked from the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained about the "window policy" of the Union in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only invited the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck (SPD), but also, according to information from SPIEGEL, frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Chinese President Wen Jiabao has called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to accept the Dalai Lama’s reception as a mistake.
China rejects it when European politicians officially receive the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama’s actions and words showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns against crows like in France
Street battles with police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns against crows like in France.
Everything must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not end in violence on the road, the German interior minister demanded.
Barricades burned, Randaliers shot at the police with shotguns: After the heavy youth riots in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
“We have to make sure that we don’t build up social explosives and get rid of them in violence.
We must take this seriously," he said of the "New Press" that appeared in Hannover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities were already working with emphasis on fixing problems, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the summit of integration to the conference of Islam, this is the first success."
However, it is too early for warning.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble pointed out at the same time that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs like in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had fought heavy street battles with the police over the past few nights.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
However, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the Federal Government.
In the face of the crawfish in France, Colat warned against "resistance effects".
The situation in Germany is not as fragile as it is in France.
But there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migration background under 25 years of age is "above average".
In particular, more training places should be provided.
Kolat stressed, "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that more "social control in families" takes place in Germany than in France.
Moreover, many young people with a migration background did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat said, "But we still have to be careful."
You have to give young people "fast opportunity to participate in work and education".
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in use, a helicopter overflew the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning trash cans and cars.
Since the day before, an order of around 1000 security forces has provided peace of mind.
The police will be in touch for as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, around 80 police officers were injured in the crash in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the aftermath, the unrest overtook Toulouse.
The crow caught fire in a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the public prosecutor’s office, the police are not to blame for the death of the young people.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke
The chancellor’s far-fetched appearance documents that the coalition is content at the end — and that nothing more can be expected of itself.
In which country does this Federal Chancellor actually live?
After her tireless performance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was cruel and low in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country that should finally be ruled by her.
The allegation that she is too focused on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with an arduously overriding sentence.
That’s provincial, she said, and first showed that she doesn’t want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the Bundestag, she has clearly documented for everyone how much their accusation is true.
There was no concrete interest or feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a retired politician who escapes into foreign policy and stays in the vicinity even there.
For example, climate protection: there she praises the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate goals should be achieved in this country.
Overall, the self-lobe - so much indecision the CDU chief would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the flakes that the ascension is coming to people.
This damages her image as a pragmatist, who solves problems rather than beautifying the world.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low earners?
She has a few extras for that.
This is indicative of how often she promises to be when it comes to the child allowance.
Three calls Merkel needs to make in order to bring out a half-way straight sentence.
She stumbles as if on foreign ground when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attack
In the Republican presidential candidates’ YouTube debate, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney deliver a tough blowback – and now they have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already relieved at the first topic.
He has made New York a “place of refuge for illegal immigrants,” Mitt Romney accuses his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
He, for his part, counters with serious accusations: “I would say his own house was a port for illegals,” opposes Giuliani and accuses the former governor of Massachusetts of having privately employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates blasted the attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favourites, the eight presidential contenders are using the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-directed 30-second videos that Internet users have uploaded via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
“With this kind of isolationism, we have allowed Hitler to come to power,” John McCain accuses his counterpart Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round demanding an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, too, is strongly read by the Vietnam veteran as he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", a method of interrogation in which drinking is simulated as torture.
However, the fact that the campaign’s key themes are now beyond Iraq war and torture debate shows the audience’s reactions in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, the Auditorium fires the bailout.
Once again, it shows where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
“I was wrong at the time,” Romney explains, cringing and begging the base and the television audience that he was still among the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to Schlinger when, in his opinion, he is asked about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian life
One day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistan’s ruler Musharraf was sworn in as president.
It ended eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf has been sworn in for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad live.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his post as army chief to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and thus succumbed to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency that Musharraf imposed on November 3.
Soon after his abdication, Musharraf will, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, lift the state of emergency and thus fulfill a further demand from the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, which Musharraf had held with him in early November following the imposition of the state of emergency, had rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state last week.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in an attack on a military convoy.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of the Krautrock return
Germany’s Supergroup of the Seventies is playing music again: The three band members of Harmonia performed their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For Revival, a cut from her great time "Live 1974" appears.
At that time, they were much more famous abroad.
The sensation is then achieved in the form of three set gentlemen at the dinner table.
Everyone has his box in front of him, his cables and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in a blue-white shirt at the age of 63 in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
Right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is concentrating on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
That the band re-musiced Harmonia has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
Here you can reveal: Targeted demand showed that the name was difficult due to collective pop memory, but not in any way so sustainable to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn’t the Germans celebrate their living legends from the seventies?
In fact, what is called a misleading krautrock was always more valid in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the survivors of the Cologne group Can 2003 the Echo Prize for Life’s Work, German pop faces were seen in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked themselves in the Laudatio even with the bands La D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf and Neu!, the surprise knew no limits.
At concerts, Michael Rother later rocked the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the explanation in the stranger is one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with harmony because the trio only existed for two years and at that time also developed a much lower power than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name Cluster.
At first, they played in the basement under the Berliner Schaub<0xC3><0xBC>hne.
Then in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly worked at Kraftwerk and then became a guitarist at Neu!, perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as city-escapes.
Less ideologically than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plagiarize as a child girl.
More like a sharp-eyed artist.
It is also alleged that a wand of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing association and a name for art was found in the waste.
A lot of people thought of Harmony.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because that’s how the music is left and modest as well, the band suffered material distress.
The collection of travel did not serve the self-invention alone.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" was cut at a concert in Griessem, before a record low of almost 50 people, as someone thinks to escape.
From Rother came the desire to force harmony and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius, an unsightly claim.
The band announced their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric-spheric and secured his existence with albums such as "flaming hearts".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has since been more successful than it ever was Harmonia.
The Griessem live album is due to Herbert Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nemeyer.
His record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as its own German contribution to live music.
New! was already excavated as Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurgence of Harmony takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
This would outline the entire range of influences of the krautrock on the subsequent pop music.
Harmonia fills the void of the supergroup.
Brian Eno’s line echoes with the most distinctive sounds in the room: “The only true music, you belong to the future.”
There are pictures that show the producers with harmony in the farmhouse.

The choir of the house does not change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns is coughed and whistled under sound clouds and sung in a beautiful place with emphasis "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were sought less in blues than in music colleges (cans), technologies (power plants) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Those who call here ''68!' are not entirely wrong, and harmony cannot be taken away from it even now.
Even the most obvious is thoroughly covered on the stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob one of the nerves or give one fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murder Peace", two films are again engaged in the Balkan War.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and gamblers or they are too fussy.
Richard Gere can't help it in "The Hunting Party."
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but calculated there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere has now been rediscovered.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties in the last few years, because too many nice-interested roles in women’s well-being films and too many press conferences on Buddhism propelled one to the point of view.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, perhaps to look at "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter Becomes the Hunt" (Why do movie titles have to be as long and windy today as Lokf<0xC3><0xBC>hrer-Tariff contracts?).
In essence, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become of Gere if fate and the film industry were not so graceful: a man who has his very best times long behind him, but who has himself as a ruinous monument of his low-hanging fortune.
But despite this trump card, "The Hunting Party", along with the German production "Murder Peace", which also starts this week, continues only the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from Kosovar snipers, and the one who quickly falls in love with her.
Although it is welcome that even here the Serbs are not represented as the sole root of all evils, the TV flat film is lost too quickly in ballerinas and action.
There remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but for that with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be explored almost by way of example, why there has never actually been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters opening up to track down the Serbian war criminal "the fox" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another scriptwriter (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are strikingly similar: both times small teams go into the woods to accomplish something the military can’t and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the downtrodden cynic with heart as he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also give him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
Finally, The Hunting Party goes down the brook when the reporters succeed within the last five minutes in the time-rafting process what NATO, the CIA and all the world’s top bounty hunters have failed to do in five years: catch the war criminals and bring the Muslim Bosniaks to justice.
This is so bad that one wants to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against kinology.
The film has a deep human interest.
He wants to complain that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (exceptionally, they will agree) not to pursue the persecution too intensively because of secret political agreements.
But the good and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
In it, it says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet’s desk: “I see with compassion the swollen forehead, suggesting: how hard it is to be evil.”
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swell heads, but they suggest how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, it has been reported in this newspaper that all Iraq films were Hollywood’s big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South African movie.
Almost always applies: when a star roams the world’s crisis herds or minefields, something like “Rangoon” comes out with Patricia Arquette, “Beyond All Borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Blood Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it had to be decades before Hollywood was able to make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films will probably still mature - the classic Vietnamese works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have not been celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today we know where every mass murder comes home in real time on the same two screens, even simply too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs writers of the carelessness it takes to tell good stories.
"Being or not" or "The Great Dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
You may not want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcastically distanced artist’s view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>res Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's only because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terrible dangerous, people will always be cruelly murdered and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
Criticism of Olympia's rejection from Beust
The Mayor’s rejection of Hamburg’s bid for the Summer Olympics has come under intense criticism in politics and the economy.
Many people still want to fight for the games on the water.
But by Beust, realism stimulates the appreciation of opportunities.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday called the resignation a "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed as great motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the sporting policy momentum would not be able to be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to “going out of a changed ray of time.”
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with earlier statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sportbund’s decision to apply for the 2018 Winter Games in Munich, which was expected to start in early December.
“This preference means for us that we will not have any realistic chances in the period we have envisioned so far until 2028.”
Still, the dream was not dreamt out for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements made by Beusts.
This will give the impression that Hamburg will no longer be applying for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to seize a chance by burying the plans already at this point," HSB President G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Plo<0xC3><0x9F> said on Wednesday.
In addition, a waiver of the application is in contradiction to the statement of the head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception for the plenary meeting of the General German University Sports Association.
There, Beust called Hamburg’s application for the 2015 Universiade “not as a substitute” for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Hochschulsportverband had only last week nominated Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD-Citizenship Group claimed to the Senate that they did not use valuable time for the construction of housing in Hamburg.
“The development of the Little Grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it put on the Olympia map and clarifies the housing construction,” said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for Little Grassbrook has always required integrated planning for Olympia and later residential use, the CDU has unilaterally put the “event factor” on the “event factor”.
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had sparked a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, failed in Leipzig.
These Are Not Warhol's Boxes
Those who combine the terms Sweden and wooden boxes think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden boxes made in Sweden throw dark shadows on Warhol’s workshop directory.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo boxes listed there from the "Type Stockholm" are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of the year 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now comes to a sobering conclusion: the six "Brillo boxes" in Brillo are also the "Brillo boxes", which the former museum director of the Musée du Pontus Hu
The prehistory is blurred, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard carton of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work in the Moderna Museet in 1968, with Warhol's consent, featured hundreds of Brillo baskets made of cardboard: these were not from Warhol (for cost reasons) but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but their examples, merely exhibition pieces.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which were then accepted as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the designation "Type Stockholm" right into the art and auction history.
Some of them have won more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that there were around 100 wooden boxes produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left him.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Bystr<0xC3><0xB6>m, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, has also investigated three of the six museum-owned Brillo boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press-pan plates were first ground and shredded, then white oil-coloured with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the paint with a paint roller was applied directly to the press panel without foundation - it is also not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve, proclaiming: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion than his Sampling/Kimlass, the Moderna Muze will be his material.
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that it would pursue the “severe allegations” raised in matters of the soap powder cysts.
But since then, they have been hiding in unceasing silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
The Philippines has been abandoned by rebel soldiers, who had snuck into a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Government-run soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas.
About two dozen soldiers had been trapped in the building for hours.
Around half of them were in court on Thursday due to a failed coup attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He used the negotiation to suddenly settle down with about 30 sympathisers.
The military police officers, who were supposed to actually watch him, had apparently run over to him and joined his slaughterhouse.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops blocked the district around the excellent hotel.
The president called for an urgent meeting of the security cabinet.
National security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People have enough,” Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the Scout Rangers' elite unit, said other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Government critics had called for large-scale demonstrations against the president for Friday.
Her government has been overshadowed by corruption allegations for months.
Manila's financial district was the main scene of the attempted massacre of some 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
The rebellion failed after almost 24 hours of the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company reported on Wednesday evening.
It now holds 20.05 percent of the basic capital.
A takeover had previously been speculated.
Keep the option open to increase the proportion of offsets even further.
The move aims to drive the consolidation of the German DSL market, United shared with the Internet.
Earlier on Wednesday, there had already been a rise in measures of courage, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf network operator by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house holds the shares only for a third party, it was said in the financial market.
The previous day, United Internet had already participated in the mobile phone company Drillisch with almost 10 percent.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
5.15 million shares of which United Internet has bought for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have entered into discussions on marketing co-operations for DSL and mobile radio products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a United Internet spokesperson explained.
The two companies have set up the MSP Joint Undertaking to take over the competitor Freenet.
First, the two companies want to settle for freenet with a share of well ten percent and not make use of their right to take over another 18.49 percent of freenet, the United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies remained open to all options, in particular to further increase their participation in Freenet AG, it said.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
The months-long and difficult-to-see poker around Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile customers and 1.27 million DSL and full-connection customers.
The holdings of United Internet and Drillisch so far held directly 6.01 percent of the freenet shares.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will bring in about four percent more.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
