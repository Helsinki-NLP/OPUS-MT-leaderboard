A Republican Strategy to Obstacle Obama's Reelection
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and states that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die from lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In that sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what is happening in Canada, the U.S. is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line, a majority of U.S. governments enacted, as of 2009, new laws that made the registration or voting process difficult.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw an increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to a proof of U.S. citizenship.
On the other hand, those laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the poll, and withdraw their right to vote from citizens with criminal background.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to submit a photo ID.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana’s law in 2008.
Therefore, the Republican authorities rushed to extend that practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to file a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with those characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
As a result, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25 percent of African Americans, 15 percent of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18 percent of citizens over 65 and 20 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 don’t have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states, students, voters who vote the most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to make such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Spanish vote.
It appears that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers backed certain laws in 2011 that abolished voter registration on the same day of polling in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have led to a fall in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers passed laws in five other states that favored the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 Florida election, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter only accounted for 13% of state voters.
In the case of Hispanics, the exact same thing happened.
These represent only 11% of voters, which is equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, representing 76% of the electorate, represent only 46% of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have fiercely opposed the adoption of laws that restrict voter registration.
In this sense, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, the damage could be limited.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states passed the law requiring the filing of a photographed identity document.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that have passed those laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to say for sure whether these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this sense, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Detection: To Be Tested or Not to Be Tested?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It’s more than enough reason to make men, self-restraint, doubt whether or not detection tests should be done.
To take the test or not?
We asked for advice from two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, a large index of infections was detected among the sample groups, making it difficult to interpret those data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been detected and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up at age 12, also showed that there are between 30 and 40% chance of metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolence.
It is really necessary to get the patient to understand the degree of risk of their cancer. You should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not attend to long-term life, in which case you should rather opt for an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, as such cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest an active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer you a treatment.
We increasingly determine precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that you take the test anyway.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be done or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30 percent of cancers could be prevented.
“If nobody smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
In contrast, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It is very harmful to people’s health.
“Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” spokesman André Beaulieu said.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The Weight
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer,” they add.
The food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large amounts, they escalate the risks of colorectal cancer.
Charcuterie products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“They can damage the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment his investigations are not conclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about each person’s concerns and family history with their doctor.
"Doing the detection test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or “less bad” explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But it’s not entirely clear to physicists that it’s about Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at an important physics conference held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is still needed to be completely safe.
Anyway, we assume it's Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem to be low.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and don’t try too hard, because it will end up hurting.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" consisting, grossly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we meet the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
And on the other are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Laboratories’ website The Particle Adventure, which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of which we will not talk here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be in any way.
These bosons, you might point out here, are not the exotic bugs we might believe.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or "light particle" that acts as the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (of light, of infrared, of ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the bosons "carriers of force".
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, however, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it you need to reach extremely high energies, a bit like an iced pond in which only a thick rock could slide over the surface.
That’s why it takes an immense particle accelerator like CERN’s (the big Hadron Collider is a 27 km ring of circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stand by itself stuck to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), don’t have it.
Now, what can all these investigations "contribute" to?, asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between MS observations and predictions.
For their part, many eagerly wish to find themselves, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that plugs certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (another ups!).
But we have not found such differences in CERN so far.
Repercussions
The impact of such research on our day-to-day lives is difficult to predict, but we don’t think we’re wrong to say it won’t have any.
For them to see: in the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not at all suspect the revolution their work would provoke.
They were going through the scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, initially the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine...
And in addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light sensor in 1969 during the course of his research on optics.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this sensor now serves as an “eye” for all the world’s digital devices, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
In his Commission to Die in Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume as soon as a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there’s still a lot to do.
Le Devoir tried to see him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year respite.
“I had been given five years of life, but I’ve been like this for seven years,” she says, making a pass, lying in her bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, which she arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resignation to help him eat.
Courageous, he even comes to smile, to talk to strangers who give him attention, bring him medicine and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is that I get treated for diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” she admits.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for that evil.
“In the course of our lives we learn that a man is standing up,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois Center.
Returning to your childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“That depends on the person’s ability to accept that regression,” he says.
Because, according to the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer “curative” care.
Mrs. A.’s greatest fear, 89, is to die “conscious and drowned.”
But the disease has made him discover his children.
“I have good kids,” he adds.
“I have no more desires in this life,” she says, before accepting that a mask is placed on her to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the coming days, a final visit from his son living in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
They are palliative care that is given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, because we all know that we'll end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouth rinses with brandy or Pepsi, according to the demand.
Diabetics are no longer in control of their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died over the course of the night.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help both patients and their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois center the days go by without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man who savors his last family gathering in the courtyard, well placed among his pillows as everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old boy tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after trying everything to survive.
“For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 with cancer,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Access to palliative care problem
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of their life, either at home, in the hospital or in a care center.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the Greater Montreal home palliative care society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely that great relative lack of health care in Quebec that causes many doctors specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law that regulates euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before it is accepted to proceed with euthanasia.
“Recently,” she reports, “I have seen a patient spend 14 days in Urgency suffering great pain without doing what is necessary to relieve it.
I’m afraid patients want to die just because they don’t get the right care.”
And in parallel, many oncologists persist with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard’s survival expectations were already low when she left a exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
“When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she regretted that I wanted to stop fighting,” she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing more to do!"
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who seek to die thank their caregivers who have not met their demands once their pain has been alleviated thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in terms of the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want euthanasia,” but “I want to be relieved.”
This report has been made possible thanks to a journalism scholarship from Canada’s health research institutes.
Large-Scale Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Road network officials, BTP entrepreneurs, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell, day after day, what they know about a formidable "system" of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters are part.
An "industry" that came out too expensive to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s curious how the system is sprayed once we’ve hunted the big media,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible by an in-depth investigation into road contract malpractices in Quebec, which the Liberal Prime Minister at the time, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party funding and corruption among officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, only the transportation ministry would have saved a billion dollars in contracts,” containing some of its instincts to stay with a proportionate share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he adds, while hoping to be able to "demonstrate the existing stratagems behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also applied with its team of government stakeholders, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the Marteau squad, which, since 2009, have made Montreal’s “candidate cartel” moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has filed serial charges of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city outside.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third city.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been exchanged in exchange for public contracts.
He has been formally accused of Montreal road network engineers and Italian-born entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused shock by explaining to the Commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He paid for three years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito distributed money to the right and left during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially liberals in power.
He also admitted to having organized a collection of illegal funds for the former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a public works engineer, explained it perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewer contracts.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating invoices between 30% and 40% in terms of false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately making the fat look at a parallel budget and filled his sheets of dirty money.
Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first elected politicians to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she has opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal land acquired for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million to promoters in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of the money in the election campaign was dirty money.
From the research that will eventually be carried out, she says she pulls "from a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and fish the culprits."
And he adds that the process is “painful, but positive.”
We are cleaning up the wounds but it would take a clean research unit in Montreal and be very alert so that dubious practices do not repeat themselves.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that “officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,” but is concerned above all about the role of “politicians elected to the stratagem.”
Estimating by 70 percent the proportion of dirty money that was spent on funding election campaigns in Quebec, he ironically says: “I’ve been told that that’s just a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100 per party, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "while electoral spending is not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It recommends a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of parties: “we cannot fall below; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger foundations, with more controls and laws.”
If this story belies the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that progress?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Day-to-day progress by your side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that’s easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don't warm up.
From my beginnings at INF Clairefontaine’s pre-training center to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I’ve always progressed in quick steps.
It will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He’s backed by like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position I did.
Is Ancelotti the man the team needed?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one equal in League 1 and is among the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think other titles will be taken in Paris.
In January I had a very comfortable conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken our place as a leader.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the eighth of the final in style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.
We want, to start, to finish the first of our league against Porto in order to be able to receive the round of eight finals.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, that is not the case.
At an economic level, the PSG is handed over to its means for that project to be realized.
Not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a great failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in bringing us that title of champions.
In the last season we didn’t get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the best conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be the good one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it with us.
Do you think the media expects more from PSG?
It is normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We've totally accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, who still find themselves with things to blame for is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what people expect most.
We will never be able to win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We tried to launch a game project.
A team is built on time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City which, after two seasons, has not managed to qualify for the eighth final, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points advantage to the day.
That would be to neglect our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well the previous season, have been “driven” by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished taking the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It is better to say that we have a "Zlatandependency".
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and he scores a lot of goals.
He has come to prove that he is the star of League 1.
And he's shown in all the teams he's been through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
It's been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and came out reinforced.
Today I managed to play good games in the selection.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and this is why we have an exemplary behavior today.
What vision do you have for the first month of Didier Deschamps in front of the blues?
He's getting results.
They are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads the team to Brazil.
Did the tie (1-1) of October 16 in Spain serve to set the bases?
That game gave us confidence.
They each fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
This is contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
In addition, as is often the case with technology, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equally.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
Bitcoin’s bid, after reaching the top of $30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to around $10 today (quotations are quoted on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It’s nothing impressive if we compare it to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in him in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competition with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual currency types such as "credits", used to advance in a video game and which can be earned by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both depositors of accounting books, verifiers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes consist of the public account book, which is spread throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a file shredding phase, i.e., transformation of a large file into a shorter and more unique numeric footprint.
Computers "pick up" the new transaction and add a number before "swiping" the set.
The goal is to find the number that a particular footprint offers (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructiblely linked to the set chain of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, one user would pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would remain orphaned, as both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is split into two regularly, most likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by up to one hundred millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in every increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in deposit.
“The ruling used does not affect the same protocol,” said Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash presents the same defect.
Weighted actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this type.
Others, such as the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the accounting book and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the "Giant Cuts" were released.
“$30,000 has been exchanged,” said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes quite a bit in the potential of this technology in addition to in the transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come out cheaper.
The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to start up in stores, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
Simply provide an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take a while for Bitcoin to be imposed, but in 2013 there could be a change,” he predicts.
Moreover, in its report the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, should this currency succeed.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished mainly Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, or Tayikos.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, these will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to French credits, was done by order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx in Kabul as of the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country engulfed in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their peasants surpassed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old Mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making themselves government land to resell them as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They are unbelievers; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived in the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
There will be work for those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is avid about mobile phones. TV and its Turkish brochures presenting a modern world have great admirers all over the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations; however, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, suppressing the position of the prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular because of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, their country has depended on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has restored its services, no reservoirs have been repaired or major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
Rumours spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to take over.
Without energy to extract the iron or copper ores from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the immense Buddhist site and remain there as the province’s most important employers.
There will also be a need for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to re-establish normal relations.
The French troops left on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, children's schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, sanitary and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making the aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO in an attempt to bring numerous intercessory works of
Those works, delicious to get local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased crop surfaces.
What will we leave as a memory after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very harsh in those valleys often located more than 2,000 meters high.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order to get rid of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that the farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled civil aid and to reach them directly.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants him full powers, he decided to play it all over.
He caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on his final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given two more months to the Assembly to finish its work.
And almost two years ago Egypt used a temporary text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial upheaval.
This new initiative has done nothing but increase the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his “autocratic delirium” and continues to “treason his word” and “pissing the law.”
On the part of its supporters, it is said that this is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis faster and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time forcing the Brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy wreaks havoc across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this resource has been voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: “either vote my text or I maintain the full powers”, powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Islamist-majority Constituent Assembly voted on the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
By mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their views.
Human rights representatives, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, substitute members, were added yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As one might expect, the articles voted on have been unanimously.
Commentators are pleased, on the other hand, that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent Assembly clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, subject to all considerations, remains at last identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the principal source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals regard him as hypocritical and consider him to be nothing more than a publicity stunt.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm their compliance with Sharia laws.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because “people called upon to speak out are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy.”
The fears of liberals are further heightened by the fact that the next rector of the university would be much less moderate than the current one.
“For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who have worked on that text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system,” explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, as the terms used mimic the religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence].
And the question that could be raised in the future would be to what extent are the competent civil judges to pronounce themselves above all of this.”
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms referring to the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few compared to those they were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
According to the wishes of the military, the revision of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defense council.
Nor will the prosecution of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as human rights associations called for.
They also showed their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to go out on television last night, demonstrations are expected for this noon.
The supporters of the head of state protested on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the world’s bulwark and a sea of salmon
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
“AIF” identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters into this “baptismal pillar” will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the calming of the storm and the nets full.
In this very place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers here travel the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
It begins in the fortress of Antonio, the Pretorio, where the trial took place, and continues along the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of crucifixion, the Stone of the Unification and the place of burial of Jesus.
In this same place there is also the symbolic Christian Ombling of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built on the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the holiest place for Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their desires, which will then become reality.
Make a vertical trip
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to build in the year 25 BC for his family.
They are located on the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, only those who devote themselves to climbing can.
Others can reach this historic summit at the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
From there, bus services are offered from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, at the top of the mountain were supposed to inhabit pagan gods.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
In a single trip you will not be able to visit all of them.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Dead Sea Manuscripts or Qumran Rolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has paintings by impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha Bath Museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth going through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dal<0xC3><0xAD>.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter into it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And they sing the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they are bathed even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not drop to 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe throughout the year.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: at 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily hold even those who can’t swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to go through saltwater, brine and healing bars and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
It retains the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it passed the famous maritime route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "same" symbol, luck will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find couples of newlyweds who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph themselves.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don’t worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shekels (currently 1-3$8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Travelling in any type of public transport costs 6 cheques and for this price you can travel by ferry for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on the Sabbath.
From Friday night to the setting of the sun on Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But Sunday morning begins a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of beef and lamb dishes, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the falaf, which are ground garbanzo balls, fruits and vegetables.
There are no street dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats that "walk to their liking" impressively.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The rumblers love the crowded places and do not refuse the treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it comes out for $15 a day.
And renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in numbers
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists from all over the world.
Most of those who came to visit the country and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeds 51% of the same index in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
“The Great and Powerful” Will Take You to Moscow: Immigrants Save for Language
As MPs and human rights defenders discuss the consequences that the law would bring on the mandatory examination, scarecrows have already appeared in the country that trade with “false” certificates.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
They are mostly citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families who have stayed home.
From December 1, a law comes into force, according to which every working immigrant will have to take a test to check their knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the sector of service provision, Community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to pass the examination of the language, if not also that of Russian history and that of the fundamentals of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
The exception is citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Persons who were able to obtain their education certificates and diplomas prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 shall not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defense of rights
The network of examination centres will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of Friendship of the Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the test in all cities, now more than 160 such centers are open in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by State Duma deputies and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights advocates, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask this question to the press: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will bring about the compulsory knowledge of the language, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First, representatives of the Immigration Service reply, this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from “labor slavery”.
Many people talk today about defending the rights of working immigrants, explains V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of your rights must be initiated before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are faced by immigrants without a profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass medical control.
Without understanding the language, says Sebelev, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping, put a "paid trip" to a creepy and narrow cove, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have received countless complaints from our immigrants.
“In their homeland they promise them one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages,” confirms the head of the labor immigration Directorate of the Tajikistan Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get mad, boss!
However, meanwhile many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much his fault but his own misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tayikos can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families don’t even have anything to feed the kids, not to mention dressing them up, shoeing them, and buying them what’s needed for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these guys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It’s hard, if you don’t know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, as far as language law is concerned, rights defenders point to an important point.
The examinations will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcoming or Prohibiting the Passage to Strangers"
Many visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not that easy.
The cause is the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only one thousand five hundred rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
“We are asked for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea,” Tajikistani citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the law’s entry into force on the language, it became clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be fake.
Several “false” certificates of language knowledge have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that “diplomas” cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they could not successfully pass the exam the first time longer to study the basic course of the language.
In addition, non-Russian-speaking immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly with regard to owners of weapons of civil use.
This is the government’s reaction to the recent incidents: To squeeze shots during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogr<0xC3><0xA1>dov, in which to squeeze seven people lost their lives.
Police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons, from 18 years to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the gun ownership law will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-handed policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "senseless rigor" be waived.
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, Russia’s criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov told the BBC news service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during the six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed using firearms registered in internal organs, compared to a total of 1,168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian arms sector will not be a disadvantage for the offender to go to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years old, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the High State.
Screenshot of the website that accepts gun orders
The first, "army or military vestige", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves,” Baranets says.
The next type of "black weapon", the ones stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
“There are proven versions that some fires were caused premeditatedly to cover the lack,” says one ex-military.
According to Baranets, gun manufacturers also put their sand granite.
“Now they have proliferated private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under the rope to the black market, including that of Moscow,” the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A large number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
“There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons,” explains the former military.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of illicit arms supply to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose topic revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the military and security forces.
Half of the black market’s weapons have arrived there “because of officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The dependant of one of the gun stores, who asked for his last name not to be mentioned, says the weapons found by illegal diggers have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a departure.
Through some bait, the supplier buys a unit, e.g. a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
“This one takes the gun to the city and sells it at 900 euros per unit with two chargers,” he tells us.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan has to be met, they make test purchases to illegal arms dealers," he added.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
“I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed to me to go to the Begovaya platform, where I would be a man who would take me to a corner where we could negotiate.
From the price of the gun, I only found out there.”
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
“To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts,” says the store clerk. “I have a friend like that, but I don’t trust him very much.”
In the markets there are sellers, but there you also have to arrive, say "on behalf of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked you to tell him that a tooth had fallen on his daughter."
I can even get a couple of steel handles through a trusted person.
He also supplies them to me only because he knows that I will not delay him.
Novices look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranets tested himself in the role of an illegal arms buyer in the mid-1990s, when he was about to publish an article on the subject.
Schemes, according to him, have not changed.
They gave him an album of photos where there was no "of all".
“I felt like I was in a luxury boutique,” recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets, is not offered a cat for a hare: everything there is to be tested.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
“They give me a chance to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shop of sofas
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
For this, no documents or personal meetings are required.
“It’s enough to have a certain amount of money,” they write in the title of the ad “Buy a gun or a machine gun.”
There users place their orders and ask questions.
And do they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n" (preserved spelling).
"I buy a pistol TT. Moscow", laconically formulates his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
Military and Ex-Military Commentator Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
“In response, they send you a photo and instructions to let you know where the gun is hidden,” said the NGO’s press secretary, Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets states that if you place an order online, you leave without a gun and put him in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures those who want to buy firearms.
“And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
You will have to wait a month and a half.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle-ranking chiefs.
According to official ministry statistics, compared to the January-October 2011 period, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, constituting 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are on strike.
Up to a quarter of U.S. teens find their first jobs as cashiers at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of low-wage protests has begun in the United States that are being waged in Walmart supermarkets and restaurants in popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now, no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or if it is destined to lose strength and slow down in its early stages.
The protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of leftist NGOs.
In addition to the increase in modest wages perceived by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the goal of the protest organizers is the creation of workers’ unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday", on that day, in the United States, the orgy of declines that captured millions of inhabitants, and was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
That day, some employees of the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, abandoned their jobs and formed protest pickets with unions and left-wing activists in the corporation’s stores, whose products are aimed at modest, moderate-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in your stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That’s why many of Walmart’s underpaid workers only shop at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford the luxury of selling products at very low prices, in part because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
That “Black Friday” participants demanded the increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 per hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart places the wage increase on consumers’ shoulders, each visit to the store will result in only 46 cents more expensive.
In one year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters say they are satisfied that the protest took place in only nine states and did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold around 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers carried out the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company’s representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview to the left-wing Huffington Post website that they left their job “less than five” Walmart employees and that the protest had been “another public relations trick” organized by the workers’ union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not exactly Walmart stores (which in this progressive city they don’t appreciate, and so for now there are none), but McDonald’s and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s says it sells billions of servings, and then they don’t even grant you sick leave and they don’t pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City City Council
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 an hour in New York.
No one wins less than them in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, to me it is something incomprehensible.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers passed through McDonald’s and worked there, behind counters, part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live off this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal forum there is a comment whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what to give them to eat.
Protesters, who started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast food cashiers and cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, i.e., that their current minimum wage be doubled.
They also demanded that workers’ unions be created in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from denying them this right and punishing union movement activists with arguments and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But, for objective reasons, it’s easy for unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is the excessive rotation of the staff.
Discordantes
Loud protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at McDonald’s located near Times Square, in which several local Democratic politicians participated, in particular City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, “McDonald’s says he’s selling billions of dollars of hospital bills, and then you don’t even get a job.
The protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that “we must support fast-food workers so they can get fair wages and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves.”
As described by the New York Times, this has been the largest such demonstration in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, not even all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people from New York work.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to cause massive movement.
“For now, cheating on the brain isn’t that easy.”
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, has recently been perceived with normality mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a moving model and later, in November, it was learned that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, it was clarified that for the company’s scientists, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted by the perspective of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to person-computer interaction, but we also try to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now, humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the working stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with its finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design ones.
The world of computing must be liberated from our own, to the physicist, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don’t you think they overestimate it?
- Of course you can not be considered a panacea, it remains to solve the question of privacy, since you do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each one in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not loose movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a wrist that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this soda can?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- Normally I'm just talking.
- Oh, that's going to be very hard to recognize.
- That is, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think in the near future we will have to work mainly on designing new types of sensors that can accurately determine the person’s reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the array and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on Z.
Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
The human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that modern serially produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects human-machine interaction.
To me it would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but it does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And you don't need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the reflected signal receiver.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible diaphragm sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the camera location curvature and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
“As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that, from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an augmented reality "transmutable" when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, in that is their strength (private things only you can see them), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the film "Iron Man", but also to any mere mortal.
There is a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh disruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth well could be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly geared to bring tangibly to these "pictures in the air", for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a similar feeling to that one feels if someone is blowing it in the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
To make him think that he feels what he looks like he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that it goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of running tapes (not like those of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, cheating on the brain is not that easy, you still have to work for many years.
That’s what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste rather than culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the St. Petersburg scene, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city meets Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from above, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and inaugurations.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophers of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the inhabitants smiles and raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he took an organ in his hands and became the organist of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to play such a difficult role, for his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why do you go around town dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, the red color is a commitment between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little gray arouses aggression and agitation of properties nothing good.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- In an exhibition of the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new ones, free as I was, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with the later ones exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is already over.
I went to the theater for clothes, music of all genres, but not for lyrics.
And all of this came together in your art clinic... - It was important for me to find myself in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical art club, a bohemian club, the St. Petersburg bohemian house.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under a phonogram, they wore tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was animator of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them to Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
That’s where our employees and clients came in.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was made in the press, the award was "The people of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not convenient to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the current and the occurrence.
I'm going to make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in clowns".
The clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so is painful and terrifying.
But in clowns, everything becomes dull and tragedy is eliminated.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and mandatory change of clothes.
Now one is followed by clothing, oriented on the outside, but not on the inside of the person.
And, maybe that person shouldn’t even give a hand, but spit it on his face.
And deception will be eliminated when you change clothes.
- We just saw you in the role of urban organist. - A cult city must have a hero like that.
Who better than me to be!
- Well, but, at best, commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have touch.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people were grouped into herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simples the other.
Now everyone has split up into micro-communities, it’s hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill to like everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov they come for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And a cultural event will take 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything is gone.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to lose what you have achieved.
When he was young he made such paintings that a collector had them hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which usually people end up with.
Now they often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I’m a man of yesterday’s culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money just to paint paintings.
I am in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: an official of culture.
But not all of them can be dedicated to culture.
When the kings were right everything was different, the kings might not understand the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow now there are very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could well be experts, but they are closed, because they need experts at a higher level to properly evaluate these and open their way.
The subjective personal taste is now flourishing.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's for St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity going to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is thin.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a St. Petersburg grant.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spaceship caravans with humans on board set off in search of a backup planet.
To preserve humanity the main question is asked: How to continue the species in conditions of pregnancy or on the same planet as a replacement?
There is little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
“These are Venus and Mars,” says State Astronomical Institute chief investigator Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
It began to address the problems of reproduction in space with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments with plants were carried out.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ in any of the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, drosophiles.
In 1979, eggs of codorniz were sent into space to check how the embryo develops under conditions of pregnancy.
As a result, we get a normal pollutant.
But then the problems begin.
“The problem is that this pollen has to find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving,” says Vladimir Sychev, director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When they couldn’t find support, the chicks randomly flipped.
And after 10 hours in newborns a total atrophy of the instincts was given.
Pollutants did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
“And twice we managed to get the chicks to be born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them,” says Vladimir Sychev about the experiment’s failure with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological “miniark” flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 the experiments will continue.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" will only travel species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
“This was precisely in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this one should be conducted,” says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction has not yet been addressed directly in space.
It is a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our flying gazelle, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
“After all, no one has answered this question,” said Vakhtang Vachnadze, a veteran of the aerospace sector.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight into space, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are counted to whom after long flights all went well, and a healthy generation is growing.
“And if you can say more, it’s dangerous even on orbital flights,” says cosmonaut pilot Valery Polyakov, a hero of the Soviet Union.
However, humanity must look for some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The cosmonaut preparation center's hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage in the preparation for flight.
Under conditions of zero flotability, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
The water simulates pregnancy.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable, though still hostile environment, for a newborn child is its native element.
The little amphibious men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for him to get used to the water afterwards.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth until the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
“This is very little to forget something,” says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravitation is necessary, the force of gravity.
In pregnancy, the abdominal and pelvis muscles decay very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, let's skip that, relying on the action of birth stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, it will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscular system.
It is impossible for a newborn in orbit to wear it with a special suit for training, such as for adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to us bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally unfit person," said Igor Pestov, head of the bioethics committee at the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, over time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships head to a distant planet that will be the home for their children born in space.
Head of NK<0xC3><0x9A>: Inspection of the "<0xC5><0xA1>varc" system has not given to the guilty politician
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation does not matter.
This is according to Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Office of Supreme Control (NK<0xC3><0x9A>) in an interview for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“The law will never be perfect,” but its application must be correct. “This is, in my opinion, what we lack,” so describes the current situation.
The joint controls of Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of incorrect practice, it mentions Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "<0xC5><0xA1>varc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the SDG (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother employers with inspectors, so is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the office having the obligation to carry out such checks or require obligations," Kala said.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German team, in which the legislation on public awards in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started doing about two years ago.
Simplified: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, this is followed by the legislation in force in each country and then the practice itself.
We have put it all together and, although the control has not yet ended, we have made very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "stricter and more complete", however, concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think are the conclusions?
Precisely a common control of this kind could help us to stop investing efforts in law making, reducing and improving borders, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of saving means getting the right thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the limit of the awards means that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much “paper” that those who want to look for failures in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NK<0xC3><0x9A> or is it organized in another way?
As for the offices, such as the NK<0xC3><0x9A>, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a school also, the only thing is that in its case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
Competences are also somewhat analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level. In this respect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) can only control federal money, which here we call state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled in the Federal Court of Accounts.
As far as local law is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to establish a comparison without specific data; however, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be precisely specified in what is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
That's certainly not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make these kind of comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it wasn't, it wouldn't be any benefit for them to collaborate with our office, would it?
As for the legislation of our country, what did the amendment to the law on public awards mean for your Office? Is it any indication of its impact?
Considering that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet appeared in the control proceedings.
Since we perform ex post checks, you need to have a certain delay.
For now, it is noted in the process of preparing future controls: we have started a new tool for "non-economic risk detection", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are changed, the conditions of some types of selection process are corrected.
Do you think that the adoption of this law is beneficial, or rather, that it is a stumbling block for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that can arise is that the regulation "hardens" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already with the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each law not respected in terms of public awards meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to harden the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal decision, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only be able to create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We’ll see where this path starts.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the SDG would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA0>varc system, referring to the fact that they are autonomous only on paper.
Is the svarc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent the Office from acting that has an obligation to carry out such checks and require obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and we allow it," but you can't say we'll do it like nothing.
In the law on public procurement, the legislation is quite strict as to how it should be formally acted, and this is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded with the best offer for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
Roads have ice sheets, although they are mostly transmissible.
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads feature ice and snowboarding.
Although most lanes are transmissible, caution should be exercised in some.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transmissible, but they featured ice and snowboarding.
The temperature drops and will fluctuate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is fine.
On the other hand, in the ridges of the Metallic Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places, visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the region’s road operations control center.
The R6 motorway and the first-class road in the region are now crossable without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially in some bridges whose surface may be frozen and slippery.
Also, all second- and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are accessible.
However, in some of them there are still stretches with remnants of ice and pinned snow.
Attention needs to be increased on the road, especially in the higher areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové
In some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, reports the Roads and Highways Directorate on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice sheets forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frosts can occur in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>krouna, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitav or Vysokého M<0xC3><0xBD>ta, and especially on the second and third category roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is especially snow on the roads of the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e Mountains and Orlické Mountains.
There is a layer of snow dotted in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In the area of Eastern Bohemia, the sky today will be between clear and partly cloudy, with no precipitation.
Temperatures will usually fluctuate between three below zero and a positive degree, blowing a weak wind.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are transitable this morning, although caution will have to be exercised and time will need to be adjusted.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frosts, temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some tracks could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what emerges from the information from the region’s road operations control center.
The D5 motorway is accessible almost without restrictions, although caution is recommended, especially on the road between the kilometre 80 and 131.
The surface of most of the first class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road border with Germany there may be stretches with ice plates.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so, in this case, sections with ice plates are also warned.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on the least traveled roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will be met with partly-waste snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>.
Road workers took the snow off at night; on the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road some three centimeters of snow were accumulated, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are accessible without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, there are remains of snow.
Drivers in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské will meet with half-a-day snowfall towards Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k,” a road operator from <0xC5><0xA0>umper to the <0xC4><0x8C>TK confirmed today.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also went to the Jesenick<0xC3><0xA1> and, after the chemical treatment, the tracks in the higher areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are passable without restrictions, in the <0xC5><0xA0>ternbersk<0xC3><0xA1> road drivers should drive with caution in the forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem region and Liberec region
Northern Bohemian road operators have reported complications in different sections in the early morning hours.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice in the region of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures are kept below zero, even in the lower areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road. Instead, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
No service complications have been reported at this time.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day it is expected rain and snow to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavourable conditions have been announced from the general roads on the I/13 road, on the border between the region of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice had to be cut off by the branches of the trees that had been arched over the road with the weight of the snow.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It’s just one of so many other alarmist news we like to grab.
The Tap Tap music group likes to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
Also, in December you organize a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state benefit act that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the Mayan calendar set for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The previous day, on December 20 at 9 p.m., we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end approximately at the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we were forging the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, t-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which bears the title "End of the World, Cancelled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear it in the benefit concerts?
Of course, yes, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
It will be sung by all performers at the same time in all three concerts.
The anthems will be linked to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k has written the lyrics of this song and plays the lead role of Jesus in the videoclip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, in addition to organizing many charity events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and have fun working with us.
What will be the money raised in concerts against the end of the world?
Equipment for the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we carry out in its sixth year in a row with the civil association Tap in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0x9C>stav.
The students of the school of Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0x9A>stav regularly receive the visit of teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
Within the framework of the completion of the works in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0x9A>stav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert there are several groups and performers.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar “spectacular action” planned in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we’d also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and personally, taking advantage of that we’re in the United States, I’d like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It’s not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in an electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which does not fail to surprise me.
Even in Moscow, where we have just returned from, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the departures abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you found so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, where it is still not uncommon for a person to travel alone through the city centre in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there is not.
Fortunately, a civil partnership has been established that strives to address the problems of people with disabilities.
In what areas should we take the example of more advanced countries?
There are many aspects in which we go behind...
But it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with severe disabilities to move on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want.
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in this regard, with The Tap Tap we go a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes for eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers to emerge, everything will really start to change.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years back, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator at Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0x9C>stav, where there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xB0>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, popularity hasn’t come up until these last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us a lot by connecting with famous singers and also actively working to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the help of the European Union, we can also afford quality teachering, equipment, etc.
Did you plan to get that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something else can be done.
The world of the show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is received with caution and takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction.
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it’s not just an advance for them, but for the whole of society.
Did it help that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do a quality job, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and require some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with their head in the clouds and when they learn they have to go two days to test, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap Group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: L<0xC3><0xA1>d<0xC3><0xAD>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group, people come in and go out, you can't avoid it.
Those who have the will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, in the Brno Fléda and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via videoconference to sing together the song of the band The Tap Tap "End of the World, Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to raise the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the STUDIO barrier-free educational center in the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0x9A>stav in Prague, costing 25 million Czech crowns.
Admission to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free admission to the pre-sale option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the Cosmos.
At the meeting of Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency last week Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA. It is the second member of ESA of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the Agency’s project commission.
However, Poland’s path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld’s lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study “Introduction to Cosmonautics”.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his "Introduction to the Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, he was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name on one of the craters of the moon's hidden face.
Already in 1925 a drawer was built in Poland that was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and the details of the project are also not known.
It is not clear whether the rocket would be used for start-up or braking.
Information about this dressin is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the missiles.
The research was funded by the Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes clear that the research reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all missile technology projects for military use and coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautze).
In the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, reference is made for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, Prof. M. Subotowicze proposed the creation of a society dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the fall of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became the vice president of the International Astronautics Federation.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Beginning in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 air tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets began in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>d<0xC3><0xB3>w desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have a 14.5 km apogee and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, in 1962 the works were suspended.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from each other by the available space for scientific apparatuses.
In the Meteor-1A the available space for volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, the first air tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
Later, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
Within the framework of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined the space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the Social Work Act is not the solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court suspended the Social Work Act.
The resolution sparked a heated debate in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less normative.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of the large differences in labour costs (of wages) creates economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and for this purpose "provokes a drop" in the price of the competitor with the aim of making itself with the most part of the market and thereby increasing its profit margin.
Large-scale means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labor, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
This whole situation leads to the total disinterest of entrepreneurs in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their pursuit of profit.
The situation is universally so well known that it is not necessary to present concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is especially evident in the changes in the laws in force.
The goal is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially as regards wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees in terms of labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot sustain themselves with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of assistance has reached a million.
Within the framework of the increased competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: people employed with a salary so low that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The austerity measures of virtually all southern EU states lead, without a doubt, to the same situation. People, pressed by an abysmal decline of their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to mallive with a terrible wage at the limit of society, hoping that one day the country will be deprived of its capital.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never arrives, as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny fraction of a European wage.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim to the satire that the state should not bring capital to the economy, that leading the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by interfering in control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence with its selfishness in the political march and, therefore, throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in mutual favours, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: the state ministries, in the absence of financial means, entrust the drafting of bills to private law firms, which are often linked to the industry.
This type of bill is then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation like the one described by Appianos in his The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state took time to disintegrate and the administrations dealt with force."
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and help to fund stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption spread unimpeded, and the people came to the polls with the vote applauded in advance." "There were no people in character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was in a state of mind, and it was in a state of mind that was in a state without consuls."
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that society today is based on disregarding preferences of individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is not able, at its core, to understand and claim the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without any effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of the fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With regard to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next coup.
The truly devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, the social and humanitarian catastrophes we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the law on public procurement is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is, therefore, systemic.
The solution is through concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and which weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his song Fragile and whose stribillo reads "Let's not forget how fragile we are" (let's not forget how fragile we are).
“If my children didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be any” Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have emerged, as always.
One, on the Israeli side, argues in favor of the right to self-defence and encase Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs and staining Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is to blame for the killings that are repeated periodically and who is the victim. After all, today’s citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who benefits from the tensions that have been dragging on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small land surface of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have come to based on my own way of understanding the matter, about who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind the history of the struggles for power is at the forefront.
In each era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who were directing their steps autonomously or whether behind their throne there was someone who was directing their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don’t know, but I don’t rule it out): the Rothschilds.
It doesn’t write very close to them.
Of course.
In the 1990s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have significant stakes in almost every central bank in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, have declared or are preparing for a war: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but meanwhile Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of Rothschild's central bank Bank of America, began during the War of the Secession to print money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their passion for world power led them during the years 1859-1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Mason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially from Britain, and the third aimed to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (such an absolute number of slaves for their welfare and luxury would be enough to consume no more than one religion).
The method by which the group of the wealthiest families, together with the Rothschilds, operates, follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, just remember that the Fed was created so that a crisis like the one of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo, and after the outbreak of World War I, they destroyed Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustifiably from a military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to prepare the land of the Second World War, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, in a covert way, a conflicting situation due to the enormous reparations of war imposed on Germany, thus creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour statement laid the groundwork for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
It was difficult to know whether Hitler threw too much of the rope to which the international bankers had tied him in the beginning or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way in which war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way to World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus was created for a third war.
If international bankers managed to initiate it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a frontline victim, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also on an international scale. Let us take as an example how Israel’s sympathizers and detractors are divided in a shaky way.
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice lead to injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their desire for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the people of Israel and their representatives, because, as is the case in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account
Under what light are now the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order.”
The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-kept financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls his entire being.
And it obliges everyone, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark on the right hand or on the forehead, to not be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the numbers of its name.
It is necessary to understand: who has two fingers in front, add up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
Argo Movie: If you get raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamic student protesters occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohamed Réza Pahlevi, who after the revolution fled to the U.S., a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation offered no positive outlook: throwing the Shah overboard could not be allowed, since, if it did, it jeopardized the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within their reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The incarcerated diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government’s negotiating intervention.
In the United States, its fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter’s defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck discusses an episode of this story, which picked up a small hit for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated outcry, they ended up in the Canadian embassy residence.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for which it helped a covert story an extravagant point: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film crew that examined the location in the country for filming a science fiction superproduction.
Combination of genres
The plan drawn up by the “exfiltration” expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example may be the series Ocean's Eleven).
The film combines the moods. On the one hand we find well-documented sequences of Tehran. The credit sequence shows emblematic photographs of the time of events, which were shaped in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are slightly lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And in addition, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: costumed men analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the hallways of the office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been ridiculed, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Adi<0xC3><0xB3>s petit, Adi<0xC3><0xB3>s" (2007) and the thriller "The Town.
At the same time, it is the first Affleck film in which the action takes place in the city of Boston, where it was raised.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran "wheels" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of true events. The introductory sequence of the taking of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic ability that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of the unconcerned and the lack of forecasting that arises when, somewhere in the past, a story gives.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the impostor team at the Bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story doesn’t offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here everything doesn’t come out so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis at Tehran airport strikes, the diversion of a call to America and the reckless search for its trail turn into madness).
Argo's frailty is the out of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck’s film loses a bit of dramatic plot, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, valuing its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But if it collapses, it will be difficult.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated that may be the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of secret services, it is sufficient.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which each year presents a survey on the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the contest on "the most absurd regulations or ideas of the EU workshop".
“It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent quota of women in leadership positions in major European companies,” said Pravo Patrik Nacher, the survey’s organizer.
Among the named absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies between men and women.
So far, women have been taking advantage of better life insurance prices because they objectively represent a lower risk.
“Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people by the end of this year.”
The election will take place at the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Among the EU's controversial regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel that, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of mercury thermometers throughout life only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the guideline darkens the size of the hens' cages price tag.
The actual ban on the use of the term “butter butter” or the removal of the classic light bulb from the shops has been criticized.
A quality banana should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus makes such decisions often under pressure from one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher-quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that this only seeks to harmonise national non-homogenised standards to date, which only complicate their marketing.
The rules referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of food.
The candidate to win the poll could be last year’s EU prescription according to which in the inflatable balloons being marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The US referred here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of childhood death from asphyxia.
There is also a similar restriction applicable to the use of sugarcane by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation on European officials: anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, we must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, named in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union’s prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the established volume for canned mushrooms, which posed a substantial fine threat to it.
The survey organisers were also interested in the occurrence of paying to those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application for grants.
This kind of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We're at a disadvantage because we don't have sea.
We ask for compensation from the European Union," said then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in the autumn of 2004.
He argued that there was a lot of grain produced in our country and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and had to be exported.
According to Palas, given that the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often subject to criticism, the EU's regulatory efforts and, moreover, more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve rather, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which Member States have achieved in the negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs are also affected by the sensitive fibre, as are other EU countries, by the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always emerged victorious from these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc requisition, but had to change its name to the national rum, the tradition of which in our country dates back to the 19th century, and became called "tuzem<0xC3><0xA1>k".
Only products made from sugarcane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with feta and gorgonzola cheeses known worldwide, the Mazap<0xC3><0xA1>n of the German city of L<0xC3><0xBC>beck or the ham of Parma, there are already, for example, the Karlovy Vary cookies, the Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> carp<0xC3><0xA1> and the variety of T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>.
As EU protected marshes, they can be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and the barquillos of Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice v Podkrkono<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm a fan, says Okamura
Senator, how did you feel about running for president?
It’s not about being a senator or president.
If everything was fine in our country, then I would not submit my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to see how it has been stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how the thieves are left to be taxed, the taxes and the retirement age are increased.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to give it a solution.
And since I’m already 40 years old and my candidacy is independent, the only way I have to change things is to present myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon after it has set out for the presidency.
Aren't you turning your back on those people who voted for him?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
I later specified that if I was elected senator, I would submit my candidacy to the presidency.
But my goal is not function; function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need as much influence as possible and the strongest mandate as possible.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the TV, but that we trample on anyone who wants to start a change.
This is added to the media, which despises you and confuses freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
I am told that I bribed journalists about being an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It presents itself to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property above twenty million.
To do this, the law must be changed.
As president it has no such competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group for the guidance office to be recognized as autonomous work, and we have achieved that.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, either from the right or from the left, they are deliberately rejected and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential for the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is he considered to be a man of the right or of the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more of the left.
For me it doesn’t matter, either a little left or a little right.
What I care about is that we move forward.
I don’t care if someone is from the right or the left, I want to unite the people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the SDGs and, in the same way, I will be against the bad ideas.
It's a joke when you're told you're a populist.
But isn't he proving it with what he says?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And try to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I talk about already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without Parliament’s support, there are only constituencies left.
It cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, a criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to get it.
If he were elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they didn’t want to.
If there is a strong character who points to disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Let us take for example the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I affirm that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I have just started in politics and I try to get as much support as possible for my program.
I try to get things out on my own, but in case it doesn’t work out, in six years I’ll leave it and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura was going to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that with a person I do nothing, that is why I have visited a number of well-known personalities, if they would best be encouraged to submit their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I have supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencov<0xC3><0xA1>, who brought out the frauds with light heating oils.
I showed up starting from the base that people are really dissatisfied, now I’m on the scale.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted for the establishment’s representatives.
In the Senate we are two from the independent sector.
The people chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven’t considered it yet because I don’t have time for it, to check the untouchable past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I have no money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Don't you have any money?
Talk about property statements, how is yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a flat valued at ten million, another flat valued at eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, he was gallant with women and at the same time he was fighting evil and injustice.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you don’t have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don’t want to put too much money on its side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to be in debt?
I have already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that there’s not too much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
The expenses of the campaign cover essentially what I will receive in terms of senatorial salary.
But I couldn't live on it, for example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't be presenting myself as a candidate.
So will you continue your business activity in order to be able to live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, I have partly abandoned my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in the spring.
The people wanted it to be the Samaritan who saved the republic.
But I also need to live with something.
How much do you earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I still win.
If I were president, I'd quit business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the recently completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic look, and finally there’s something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a street passerby.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: “Furthermore, the building is beautiful.”
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have the Internet, tablets and e-books.
No one likes to go into those old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town located at the gates of Rotterdam that barely deserves a fleeting visit, boasts the dubious honor of rising with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear represented in the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so it was as the political leaders decided that there was only one possibility to improve the statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar charts and responsible for fun buildings besides cynics, took the subject with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked perplexly around him and shrugged, Maas proceeded to pile up the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the Spijkenisse mountain of books, the so-called <0x60>Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain rises at its intended location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and townhouse buildings.
In early November, the mountain of books was awarded the second "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town lacking history, which to date had nothing but a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade one would rather intuit a milk plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a quesera.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountainous massif, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography every step of its climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to embrace with the view, the padded brick floor and the elegant headlights unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
By raising the view you can get to view the park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Usually bookshelves are arranged along the facade and in the center a huge dark room opens up which is usually something uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to put the classic spatial configuration on top and take out the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserve the black shelves that assume the functions of wall cladding, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, the touch and the smell are strange.
Even the most up-to-date architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And so it is like one day, in a fresh agricultural holding, we come across the appropriate by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in the greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of a few millimeters thick has been used as a base to hold the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine tissue lasts for two seasons and then is discarded.
For the library, this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, to obtain four centimetres thick planks.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a new car mix and sports shoe.
After 105 steps it reaches the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but in it you can also enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant ambience in pairs that maintain the appropriate atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
“Although it is hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,” Trouborst points out.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Despite the fact that the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunnier days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden enclosures located in a transverse direction to the glass facade serve to give shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is a matter of automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker in the information technology sector, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there too.
Similarly, Chinese traditional medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifies the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill, at the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete file; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
“There is nothing worse than a half empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain connection with this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Even if it's only there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a whole success in that queen discipline that in the specialized argot is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and uncultivated it may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more prominent role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather pelicit diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany understood that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the status of an observer state of the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
- Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I do not think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about establishing a no-fly zone.
This was finally declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, it is.
This is because he is currently reorienting his foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes it even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but are not used to doing so.
I think they’re still figuring out what their role will be, but they’ve already begun the road to a “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Great Britain.
What does “normal” foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken in relation to the conflict in the Middle East and in the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, he must be careful and not alienate himself from the Arab public opinion, nor from the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn't give it that much importance since it's not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the U.S. by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think there has been such a drastic break-up as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has managed to achieve a certain degree of respect.
After all, all this has only been done to demonstrate that it is a country that they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the U.S. has clearly shown itself in favor of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the U.S. and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of American domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot publicly defend that position.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not actually have the scope that is attributed to them.
If we look at relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is by no means enthusiastic about the policy he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that’s exactly what makes it so difficult for Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher entity, but they must push things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will assume a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship it maintains with Israel.
This has always been a pilgrim issue.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take on a leading role?
Or is it still hard for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always something uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to have a more important role to play.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as the main actor, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
U.S. influence in European politics is decreasing more and more, but the EU is not currently covering that gap, so who is left?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more prominent role.
Even if they don’t like it, if they find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, it’s life!

"Brand Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a well-known brand worldwide and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is hidden a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the true eponyms do not file a lawsuit.
And even then it is not clear that they will be given the right.
“Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the Taylor Wessing law firm specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to record their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way as the sports goods manufacturer Puma has.
Pattloch opens an archive where he holds seats at the Beijing trademark office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In the big cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature. On behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a denomination that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or companion brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
It refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
Chinese authorities are not to blame.
“It’s harmful to the business, we have to fight against it,” Pattloch demands.
“The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage the image suffers is enormous.”
The financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors affected are multi-million dollar, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from market analysis firm CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, China is, in size, the third largest and fastest growing luxury goods market.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in trademark registration is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
Processes can last up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had taken so long that the name in question had already become a "market reality".
“If the plaintiff is in bad luck, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the lawsuit has damaged his trademark in China,” Pattloch said.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the most well-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That is why today the Chinese can continue to use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that was largely reminiscent of BMW; the matter was settled in the courts and Geely had to modify it.
The clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, “the job emergency situation has returned to normal.”
In this way, the number of unprocessed claims processes has been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than in the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending for resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As is usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and means that China is leading the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in terms of rights would have been embroiled.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the group has been fighting in the courts against a Chinese impersonator.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the impersonator has managed to secure Chinese rights over the Freudenberg brand.
“We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected,” says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the appeal of the Munichers.
In the following two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the other side is still fighting today.
You have to be very careful
The case has now reached the doors of the Superior Court of Justice, where the case remains pending.
Wentzler trusted in being able to resolve the issue favorably and praised the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that “the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time.”
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business file has had to review records up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the other side a "sum of six figures in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it was not successful.
“This shows how much we care,” says Wentzler.
The dangers that lurk in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
specifically if the impersonators there secure the rights to unprotected marks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and skin products.
The group has long since abandoned this commercial field, however it managed to prevent registration.
“You have to be very careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend German companies to be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but what needs to be done is to “register also in China everything that may be susceptible to protection,” as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the topic may turn out to be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the other party license rights by his own name, as explained by Wentzler.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir Tests and in Swaziland, AIDS Orphans Rejoice
The history of a bond capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and moccasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and they find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
It is only then that the voices of the singers (contract, bass, tenor and soprano) begin to slowly rise, swirling, numbing and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his box almost by trying to put his energetic and gentle gestures in order.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the choir Imbongi tries a new song.
The 50 singers, aged 23 to 69, have also arrived, from the human geneticist to the host.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, there are approximately 34 million people worldwide infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is already seropositive.
The Voices for Africa association has found in Germany patrons for the 180 AIDS orphans of the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover the school’s tuition, uniform and will guarantee you a hot meal every day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "story teller" or "panegirist" in Zulu.
In this room no one can fluently speak this Bantu language, but singing they do know.
For ten years this choir has been trying songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
At 8,733 kilometers of straight line distance from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
About 2,000 people live there, some even in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 people no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying with something more than thirty years has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered this coveted population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but mainly: food, clothing and training.
Without a school title, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few which made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal every day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since been professionally engaged in AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the main diseases of sexual transmission?
Among the ETS of bacterial origin are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Ladillas and sarna are among ETS transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of people affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more common in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany originate in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (hongo) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively rare; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This is one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause sores in the genital area, problems with urination, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and are therefore not detected.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend that you undergo regular medical examinations, especially if you change your sexual partner frequently.
If diagnosed early, most STIs can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, of the fees charged by the choir for their performances throughout Germany, they come to raise a lot of money.
“In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” says Annette Lennartz, the association’s president.
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini a woman who is self-confident and with leadership gifts manages the money sent from Germany.
It takes care that orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as it is called the older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans at their disposal, offer them a roof where to live and take care of the children going to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are left under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 starving children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two hens and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has managed to get many of the people to undergo an HIV test.
This is not something obvious, since, despite the obvious fact that this disease is nationwide, it is not often openly talked about.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and full of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially unacceptable way of life is largely responsible for the spread so rapidly that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But it’s also due to the countless temporary ones who travel the country from one side to the other and take it where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "In any corner you can get free condoms, but these are barely used.
It’s another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact.”
To foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years across South Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, fighting spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but it has also managed to tear out a couple of tears to some that another angry border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the patronized children.
Although this small population barely appears on the maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river is well known.
“Close to Esitjeni, there the light shines,” the locals say.
And after walking the 8,733 kilometers straight line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the step, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light shining from there.
NASA Discovers Ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the U.S. space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there is also ice water, as evidenced by three studies published Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that an ice layer has been formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow.
It appears to be at least 30 centimeters thick and probably up to 20 meters thick.
The water comes presumably from comets or, most likely, asteroids that in their day collided with Mercury.
No one is related to the discovery of ice with the possibility that there is life on the planet, says lead researcher Sean Solomon of the Messenger probe.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Completely inadvertently for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the immensity of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "new born" stars.
This region of star formation, unromanticly named by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This image of a star in extinction was taken by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic star formation zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are a visible object with a simple view into the night sky.
However, with the telescope the colors can be better appreciated.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the constellation of Aquarius.

Depending on the tones, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark dust lines divide the hot heart of this star-forming zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of merging collide with each other to end irretrievably crashing.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it by the surname of Molinillo Austral.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula at 1,400 light-years is composed of dust particles that are between ten and a hundred times smaller than the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and radiographs made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served as a model moment for NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star formation zone constantly produces new stars.
In this star cloud, associated with the Roseta Nebula, new stars are also continuously emerging; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when hydrogen could be found in the universe above all.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It appears that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the picture, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope is built.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately 11 meters.
The disadvantage of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its peculiarity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope, researchers can explore the universe in search of extraterrestrial life signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) you can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.

Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or Extremely Large European Telescope).
Its primary mirror will span 42 meters and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located in the Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which next to them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Mauna Kea is planning to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information in the cosmos comes to us from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the latest pre-launch preparations for the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers start from the base that in the southern pole of Mercury there is also ice.
However, there is no conclusive evidence, as the Messenger probe rotates around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists are now sure that it is so.

A search for footprints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great strep through the winding road that passes next to wooded hills, high flow rivers and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it is in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a people of which not much is known, except that they perfectly dominate Persian and Azerbaijani and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town presumes a perhaps too solid architecture designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit into such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely get to this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban cores, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilatea Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world,” Fatulayeva says.
He is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshi of the place that have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
His son died at the age of 136.
However, the indisputable star of the museum is the sheep shepherd <0xC5><0x9E>irali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate that certifies it.
And if we take into account that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that the age of M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov is quite suspicious.
“He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,” Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, apparently still had time to conceive another daughter at the age of 136.
Has Shirali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov been wrong at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the advanced age of this Central Asian resident.
“In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, there are also very elderly people,” says Scholz, “even in Sardinia there are many older men.”
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; at most when there is no civil record either.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over the age of 100.
Why live here, in the south, so many elderly people?
The Azerbaijani tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the talyshis.
The director of the museum, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the calorie-rich diet of talyshi, who love meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
Or maybe it’s the natural way of life that keeps people young? In Cenemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, he is relatively young for what is styled by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, tirelessly moves a huge tin of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom became grandparents a long time ago.
They also play from one side to the other two young children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that serves in typical bowls with an embossed shape.
Mirzayeva’s teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the scarf hides two long braids of dark blonde hair that her son discovers us proudly.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen off me and has kept its color.
“I’ve never used a shampoo either,” says Mirzayeva.
Retirement is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I’ve never been to a supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything went back to its origin when the "Dear Father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This type of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of an older woman.
In Azerbaijan, however, the worship of the father figure of the nation, who runs his country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when he ceded the witness to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) in terms of monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s son is right: “in our culture the greatest are very respected.”
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't reason enough to stay alive for many years...
In the Constitution, there is a lack of the expression "Human rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is submerged.
The future constitution, with sharia as its basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare in patheticism.
“We have to overcome the transition.
And that it happens is my responsibility, to the people and to God,” he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Coptic Christians, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the seculars.
All of them, plunged unreservedly so far into a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily override the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his powers “to be able to save the revolution.”
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a PhD degree from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does that mean for “principles”?
This was and still is open to interpretation and it seems that the Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal maneuver it carries on, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what a new article suggests: in all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It doesn’t have to be that way, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that – in fact – would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship these courts served to exert harsh repression on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft stipulates, the state must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
It is such an inaccurate formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
To be clear, this is nothing more than censorship.
Indeed, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead, another prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what an offence is and how it should be punished.
Equally doubtful is the formulation that prohibits “offensive to people”
Is a president’s caricature or a joke about a reader enough?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and that, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to referendum.
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been closing ranks in the face of Islamist superiority for weeks.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at Tahrir Square in Cario and vowed to make the Act fail before it can come into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will end up winning,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranks third on the list in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution should be “in the bucket of history’s trash.”
On Twitter, he accused Mursi’s followers of wanting to lead a “state strike against democracy.”
“When I call the referendum we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been shed," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
“The Qur’an is our constitution.”
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community made a call to hold a counter-manifestation; at least not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in the cry of “the people demand the application of the divine law.”
They demanded that Mursi "cleanse the country", while proclaiming: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Mursi’s supporters did not want to risk something like this happening.
The Muslim brothers stated that both those who oppose the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now would be the time to let the people decide in the polls which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of Islamists has guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were detained in prison or had to face trial during Mubarak’s dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason, he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the term 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," he laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of Mursi's powers to the three powers of the state caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it,” Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without the organizations of civil society.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: “You are conceiving a monster that you will not be able to control.”
The Norwegian rakfisk: the most malnourished fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards, not only of Europe but of the world.
Is it possible that the country’s success has any relation to its greed for an extremely bad fish?
Take a series of over-cured cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway’s exquisites.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is salted trout that is allowed to ferment in water for, depending on how bad you prefer, up to a year.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival that is celebrated here in Fagernes, dedicated to this meal of the most, so to speak, captivating.
“You eat raw and then you drink a glass of aquavit from a drink,” says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the “General of Rakfisk,” who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking from a drink important amounts of the drink.
“Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk,” says Harvard.
The drink can kill the smell.
I'll try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near your nose, it’s not bad; it’s not very different from a serving of sushi that you’ve walked a few miles by bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty rattled Norway and in which, before cooling existed, fish were stored during the fall submerged in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is taken out and, obviously with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of people from Sweden, the old rival and even not much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, an essential, though rather unpleasant, part of Norway’s past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A can of beer or a sandwich costs you the fridge of 10<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like it to be.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the July 22 incident".
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own would be able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway’s current wealth lies the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, as she walks past rakfisk trays and who, with her long blonde sweater and her surprising blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
“We are, as you say, cautious people.”
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn’t have during the years leading up to the global financial crisis, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
“As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a crumpled unfold.
I'm in the snow making queues to eat something; I've already had enough rakfisk.
Now a hamburger of garlic is certainly something different and quite succulent to taste.
But at night, that nasty fish comes back.
The hotel I stay in is one of the many venues where a rakfisk dinner is held where diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nasal pits the most.
A television has connected live with a bird-carrying presenter who is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
Looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Harvard."
There are laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps beaten by the aquavit.
Or maybe they are the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto faces a tough start
As Mexico’s incoming president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant analyses the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad today.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already in itself congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the management of the nation.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been getting good economic results during Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s outgoing government, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
“I’m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.”
Prior to codifying with the President of the United States, Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a’s previous political experience was as governor of his home state, Mexico.
A very populated and fast-growing state, surrounding the capital; Opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is remembered with affection.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of tourism on the spot and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive on one of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto’s new roads, which is a huge improvement compared to the beaten and steep roads that were rehabilitated.
Plates with their name can also be seen at the entrance to a modern multi-sport and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We trust that he can make a real and lasting change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, MP for Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto’s party, the PRI.
“Particularly, in terms of security and the economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country needs so much.”
After an uninterrupted 81-year period in power, the PRI was decommissioned by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
It also rejects the rating that the opposition lacks the essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He’s a fantastic statesman and, above all, he’s a person who knows how to listen.”
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated highway stretches is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also harsh and urban.
Earlier this year, military intervention was called for to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighborhoods and violence against women is especially serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juarez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto say, at best, that he did not know how to address the problem of feminicide while in office.
Most critics accuse their administration of fattening.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buend<0xC3><0xAD>a has to make efforts to contain the tears while showing me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner killed her.
"When I got to her house, it looked as if her body had been cleaned," recalls Mrs. Buend<0xC3><0xAD>a.
"There were signs that he had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared."
As her mother recounts the story, a photograph of Mariana observes from the walls, next to a cross in which a single word is read: Justice.
However, that’s exactly what the family says they’ve been denied.
“The state authorities have treated me as if I were an old gossip, a gossip, a complainer.
What they want is for you to simply accept what they say and shut up.”
“But that cannot be so when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence,” he says.
The presidential band that President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term.
“I hope it’s the same kind of president it was when he was governor,” says PRI Olvera’s deputy in Valle del Bravo.
However, that’s exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not report abuses, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to deal with allegations of Bradley Manning abuse during his stay in prison
The trial focuses on Manning's period in Quantico's military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning's imprisonment was severe
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove Friday that soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to denounce the ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while under military detention.
During the interrogation that the prosecution conducted to Manning in a pre-trial view in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Commander Ashden Fein stated that the records of the weekly visits of officers of the unit that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a view made following the defense’s request that the case be dismissed given that his imprisonment had been severe and that this had already meant sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought of suicide while in detention.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
At the sight of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after Manning's visits during his arrest in Quantico's military prison, where he was incarcerated under maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers would have asked Manning questions and noted their answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had rated the treatment given to him by the lockers as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, even though the officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning responded that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers visiting him had spoken about those issues and had indicated to him that they would be dealt with, but that they did not record those issues in the record.
"They were writing 'no incidents' (after talking about the problems) but that doesn't necessarily mean I didn't mention any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why she had not denounced the treatment she received during the January 2011 meeting with a council in charge of examining the suicide intentions she had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "injuries prevention" regime under which he was under.
The military said it had been placed under that restrictive regime, which is a degree below that of surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure its protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the older state to know that I was fine and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... so I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison located at the naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness due to heat.
He said the fact that he would not be allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage,” Manning said Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning claimed that, once moved to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, blanket, slippers, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, as he was forbidden to sleep or even to lie down during the day.
Manning claimed he always had a light coming from outside pointing to his eyes while he was sleeping.
He said that if the lockers couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so he could turn around again.
Manning’s attorney filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about the treatment Manning received.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in Thursday's statement that, after being forced one night to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning countdown to stand naked in front of the jailors and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge’s interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the order given to him by the lockerman that he should drop the blanket with which he might have been covered, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning claimed he had told the officer that he might have used the elastic of his underwear or his keys to self-harm but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night they had removed his underwear, his slippers, and his glasses from his cell.
Her lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences she has had during her stay in prison and drastically reduce her sentence should she be convicted on the war council, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it planned to make Manning guilty of minor crimes and to defend other charges deemed too extreme.
The view is expected to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was detained under the rules of application to any detainee who is under maximum custody in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, unlawful publication of information on the Internet, filtering national defense information, and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
He says many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette says Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely descended from the expansive and arrived at the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Some signs indicated the way to two tails: one for "Mexicans" and another for "Foreigners".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where to go.
Growing up in Central California, I’ve been called “Mexican” my whole life.
It’s ethnic tachygraphy, just like my Boston friends refer to themselves as “Irish” or my New York friends call themselves “Italians.”
I later decided on “Mexican-American.”
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, tachygraphy or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish. Good enough to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don’t have the vocabulary level of a native and I can’t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought about that moment this week when Mexico’s president-elect, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always, the leaders of these two countries meet, he observed: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why a Mexican is so likely to stay in Mexico that he ventures to go to the United States.
It wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trade bloc in North America.
In addition, Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto promised to continue fighting the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Probably most Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of their territory to gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think for centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remind themselves of it are everywhere.
So, the moment a U.S. official says anything that carries the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Moctezuma stand up for war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a whole challenge is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about revenge?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason that there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, somewhere in our family tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was locked the door of opportunities in Mexico and yours.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of study, coming from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not in Mexico.
And even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight that what we are living is that, the American dream, not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty does.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over our shoulder as if we were from a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
As you can see, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they wouldn’t have left.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally when she was a child, reminds me that there is this rock between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of both countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you are not rooting for any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to complicate things even more, so I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised Mexico’s “ambassadors,” representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American colleagues how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And with wage inequality, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us aren’t so sure it’s a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be alone with this idea, friends.
It's fair.
If some Mexicans are still not prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resented for how their relatives were treated much less time ago.
Mm-hmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of useless and usual discussions about who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the city of Jerusalem and the capital of Israel.
But, even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their ancient conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left it all made pieces whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional turmoil.
Perhaps this will make your struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that their lethal dead-end situation could be unleashed.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on Nov. 21, this week’s clashes have bolstered the hawks on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has received a good blow.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its ruthless rivals Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that time plays in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence across the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a renaissance regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas, and Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf, has also done so.
Exulting Hamas members say the Islamist half-moon is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia party dominates, passing through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern side of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populous and fundamental Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lay despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood are Hamas’ cousins and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas emerges as a protagonist to which it cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel’s Iron Dome missile system has proven effective and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more calmly... for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the latest wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part thanks to the barrier that corroborates the West Bank, the main piece of a territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects the international settlements that continue to increase despite the fact that Israel continues to expand.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even harder-line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the pre-election period on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why spoil those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets just like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing is imposed, although the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel too much, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
Starting a war with the region’s superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire is a good wish and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think in the long run.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, just as this week it exploded a bus in Tel Aviv.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics are making the situation worse as the Arab population increases.
The brutal missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one preached by sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the transfer of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire gives a little more impetus to the outside people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to stop the entry of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a 1967-based Jewish state, with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs outside the issue should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual state category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he omitted to present his own plan for peace.
Again at the White House, it seems equally reticent to devote his attention to him.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The law of generic tobacco packaging comes into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases look on boxes of a turned off green color, which are the same for all tobacco brands
Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands with a wrapper of an olive green extinguisher, scary images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of children and babies sick by being children of smoking parents.
Except for the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed on a small font type.
It is the strictest regime in the world for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government says the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamorous.
Trust studies that show that if a person hasn’t started smoking before age 26, there’s a 99% chance they’ll never do it.
“It can be seen that children, even from a very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and these changes will not affect the profits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would encourage the black tobacco market, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
“The legislation will bring serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Other people say that their business has benefited after the passing of the law.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, claimed that the demand for pickups and silicone covers to cover the unpleasant images of the boxes had skyrocketed from almost zero two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan filed a lawsuit against Subacco.
She said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that she was expecting more stock.
“It’s a good business for us.”
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
After a series of Australian laws that ban television advertising and sports sponsorship and force most sellers not to put cigarettes on the market, tobacco marketing has gone on to be done online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict it to foreign pages.
“If you trade tobacco and you only have this small window left to promote your products, online space is the most compelling place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in reviews of brands from “walking citizens” published on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if it’s just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or if some marketing company is behind it all.
The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what involves new regulations than on marketing.
Industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to reject the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, even though none of these countries have a significant trade volume with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in the boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia, many smokers are challenging.
“The pictures don’t affect me.
I just don’t care about them.”
“Take the cigarette and keep the package,” says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, the manager of the King of the Pack pond in downtown Sydney, indicates that uniform boxes make it more difficult for him to put them on the shelves.
“It usually took an hour to drop off a delivery; now it’s four,” Yu says.
“The government should have totally banned tobacco and then it’s, well, it’s over and we close the store,” he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it’s not so bad to get a little bored
During this year’s Thanksgiving holidays, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting us from duty-free stores.
But there are more and more academics and experts in child development who praise the goodness of boredom.
According to them, it is good that, both we and our children, we get bored from time to time.
Absurdity forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we don’t experience the benefits of boredom.
So should we accept boredom in good faith?
Yeah.
And no.
But, we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book “Boredom: A Lively History” published in 2011 by Yale University Press, does not.
“In fact, the story of boredom is very extensive,” he says.
In the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin on boredom dating from the 1st century AD.
We should also consider how we define boredom.
“The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in very different ways,” says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing published research and putting the idea to a 100-person discussion group, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of “desiring, but not being able to, participate in an activity that fills you.”
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
It points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is “the alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly.”
Boring can sound awfully like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that although they may be related, people who are bored tend to view the problem as an issue of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be theirs.
Sometimes we think we’re bored, when what really happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues referred to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape from a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups listened in the adjoining room to a full-volume television show that did not keep any relationship, others listened to it with the low volume, so it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the low-volume program showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they weren’t sure why and attributed it to boredom.
“When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, distracting attention can lead to boredom,” said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the study’s authors.
“On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, like detecting defective parts on a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not to get bored.”
“In fact, we now know that moving or snoring, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight it, as they make that person physically more alert.”
“Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain silent,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it’s like to get bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, an especially boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale of tendency to boredom".
The scale includes issues such as “many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous” and “there are so many things that interest me that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored while at school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that “teenage is a period when boredom reaches its highest levels,” largely because both children and teens are not given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: Is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as making bets or falling into the consumption of substances as a method of combating it, as evidenced by research.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
“Burning is the brain’s way of telling you that you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what’s most appropriate.
If you are bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch television, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
“So, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to do so,” says Professor Fenske.
And “that ability to dosed applies to other situations,” he notes.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but also learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don’t think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn’t be too critical of him either.
Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable away from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a desire too distressing and disturbing as to relate it to something that’s worth it,” he says.
It points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated,” he says, “it’s hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops.”
Colorado: No instruction book for the new law on marijuana consumption
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community institute and soccer player in southeastern Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal across the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when police stopped them.
Police found marijuana in the car and a time later Orozco received a court citation for possession of drugs and related items (smaller crimes each involving a $100 fine) in which he was informed of the trial date.
“They treat us like criminals,” Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the Colorado vote to legalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response to hundreds of minor drug-related causes depends less on the law than the location.
Hundreds of minor marijuana-possession crimes are being quashed both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against those over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But Colorado’s most conservative district attorneys have pledged to move forward with open cases of marijuana possession and are still citing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent newly authorized marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“All of this is changing so quickly that I don’t know what’s next,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police at Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the issue around.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licenses; all before the deadline, December 1, 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado goes ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
“There is no real precedent that serves as a model for us,” he says.
Washington’s law, called I-502, comes into force on December 6, which also leaves a year during which it will swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that must be resolved during that period, such as the way to maintain a balance between the state’s requirement to offer “appropriate access” to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of conducting cannabis business within a radius of less than 300 meters of schools, parks or playgrounds.
“Nowhere will it be harder to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a research group recently created.
On November 21, Oates, Aurora’s chief of police, sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city’s prosecutor would stop taking legal action for mild marijuana possession offences to people over the age of 21 and that police would stop bringing charges against them.
Police chief Oates said they would be in charge of enforcing the city’s regulations that regulate the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug traffickers and sellers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, primarily to pressure consumers and to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office is under an obligation to take legal action against those offences that at the time they occurred were a crime," Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like Mesa Rural County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Grand Junction police, the county's largest city, no longer cite adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, a county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the cases pending by possession.
"I don't think he's wasting his time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing marijuana consumption for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
“It’s a cultural barrier with district attorneys,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents marijuana defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of the Marijuana Law.
“It’s been so long taking people to court that they can’t actually accept it as legal,” he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become national trial cases in terms of drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new legal sales border, they also look forward to receiving federal government directions, which still foresees the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of marijuana legalization are hopeful that the Justice Department will give up.
Although there have been some notable arrests of patients and marijuana salesmen for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales businesses to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
“While anti-drug agents are likely not to throw doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, they will likely be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores to sell marijuana for recreational use, allowed under the new law,” said Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will be around a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
“We don’t want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a board member.
“Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying for what the community voted against voting for what the state voted for.”
There are a lot of questions about it.
Petronella Wyatt: "They harassed me to the point of throwing me out of Oxford for being a Tory"
Students are not attacked for their views only now
I don’t remember any time in my life when I wasn’t dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of occupying my seat at Worcester College in the late 1980s to race the History race, I had already made the suitcases, triggering the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I had left because I did not tolerate some college mates having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced jokingly that I had left because they forced me to drink in uncooked cups.
The truth was less fun.
Get out of there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, nor the fact that it came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only, that in the cradle of the supposed illustration was something intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they're wondering what that's all about now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right-center students is suffering a similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of students of the Conservative Party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College (JCR) group of students say they are “often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as non-gratified people” for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on your college’s Equal Opportunity Committee to make sure you can express your opinions freely.
His situation was not favoured by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (Paradise: Young, Bright and Right) on student politics and which featured the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
He showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party (OUCA) Association, in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a stick with a silver handle.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as “Turkish heads” by the introduction of higher tuition rates.
Luke Black, 20, and vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Party Association, said in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing leftist trend in universities.
People assume we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other.”
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, says this environment is “uncomfortable,” while Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old OUCA president-elect, says JCR members’ attitude toward people who are centre-right has worsened.
“This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September 1986, I was an 18-year-old terribly shy.
Hatred for the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a title "honoris causa" after cuts in funding for Higher Education.
The atmosphere would have shocked any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the welcome week to the new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I discovered that not only did the professors look fat in the face of the mold that was made of conservative university students, but they participated in it with good will.
The policy of the miners’ strike, privatization and the government’s opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached the seminary’s wooden rooms.
The first French texts of the 18th century were to be translated into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
Not the first one.
Pitt, a low-minded man with a face that looked like a piece of cake, knew how to throw out bad bile.
“Is it thatcherists refuse to learn French or is it that they are simply stupid?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people," Pitt said.
I returned to my room as a grieving soul.
That night I sat alone at dinner in college; then I felt a slight palm on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They get along with anyone who is suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be laborists.”
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted this song.
I turned into the twisted dirt.
“How do the Tories have sex?” one asked.
“They beat each other, didn’t they?”
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who thought like me only after dark?
Would I have to become a labourer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History destined for my college.
They hated him for being not only of the Conservative Party, but also Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was barely there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of its adherence to the Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he said.
I started to travel daily from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, finding refuge in my family and friends of more open metropolitan mentality.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my beloved dream needles.
Even my communist friends have always had an impeccable attitude.”
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
My heart would break if you let it go.”
Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another History professor had hinted, speaking totally seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Red with shame on the inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and called them "stupid old men."
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career in Oxford.
By that time my father was writing two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked with a key.
I was in a frenzy of fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left I made the suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you called me a weak lorona.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, who has not only trained 14 Conservative Party prime ministers but, to this day, is hiding behind an undeserving reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentine: Maestro de la Constura", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentine: Master of the Seam", a retrospective apotheosis that brings together more than 130 high seam dresses created by his "Maison" for the last 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the colophon of a story whose only protagonist is "il Signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rare and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, private letters and photos abound with the signature of the most generous of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from humble modest of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the image of the international "jet-set".
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
“At least they don’t wipe their furs off your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
“We all loved being invited to their chalet in Gstaad,” explains the ex-wife of “Heini” Thyssen, an intimate of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, looking for a Valentine
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the fashionista.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner on his floor.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything was seen and felt its spirit.
“Each of the guests made us feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model”, who began working with him during the High Coaster Week in Paris, in 1995.
“It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art,” he concludes.
Alcurnia Parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-matched love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-meter-long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade through the walkway to contemplate a dream "audience" that lights Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that she chose for her boyfriend Jackie.
In that public of manikins, names such as that of Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the Modest, 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he made me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muse.
“I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love of women, because it enhances our beauty,” adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors you use, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescriptor Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of getting to have the age and the opportunity to be able to wear one of his evening suits...
Finally, the time came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with fly skirt, draped "corsage" and a word of honor.
“It was a dream come true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her modest party dresses with "the utmost care... because a dress is not only a dress, it's also the set of memories it carries."
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of Somerset House’s exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller’s wedding dress at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the modist calls his seamstress) to craft that ivory silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different types of lace and a four-and-a-half-metre tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of the high seams of the late 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Dressed for years with the elite's "savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre", Valentino is now his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest rank distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of his clients' spouses.
“I’ve always been drawn to his refinement, his calmness, his pulsating and perfect look,” D’Arenberg admits.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, time doesn't pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, carriers of the Indonesian volcano are playing life and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone trails
There are people for whom their work is hell and another who literally works in hell.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies upon coming into contact with the air.
After tearing out large sulfur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, she carries them in two bamboo baskets that she loads on her shoulders through steep stone paths.
They are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters in altitude, but the exhausted bearers take more than 40 minutes to ascend to the turtle step, keeping the balance and slowly measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall by the precipice.
They know that any transpiration could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fired years ago for the risks of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
Once up, they take a step between tourists who photographed them as if they were circus monkeys and, loading the heavy baskets tirelessly, they walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, to its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) per kilo of sulfur.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make candles, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As usual it is 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) in each trip," explains Anto, who usually performs three daily doors.
It takes three hours in each and ends in milling, but they allow you to collect 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery to such inhuman effort, it is triple what it would win in the field.
“The newspaper of the miners is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” explains the bearer, who previously worked as an alba<0xC3><0xB1>il on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the tajo was not that hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as heavy as sulfur.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs and irritates his eyes for toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing three games in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to charge her despite covering her face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that the volcano releases.
It’s the price you have to pay to get your dream.
“I’ll work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist to a hotel, but instead does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden cabin with other carriers, it rises every day at two o’clock in the morning because the sulfur does not stop driving at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends to the crater with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 carriers load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its benefits, the mining company has not machined sulfur extraction to save costs or supply any equipment to carriers, who work on their own and at both weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) camera charge that, along with the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the keepers of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is for animals and not for people,” said Madrusin, a 42-year-old supply carrier who has been in Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
Being able to lift up to 110 kilos, she says she will endure working “all she can” because she needs the money to educate her three children, between 18 and 10 years old.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and clears the eyes when the wind changes abruptly and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of serious diseases... beyond, of course it is, of their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and pain in the knees.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his companions take 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat road between the swamps.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth well, where he lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30, also works carrying sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest jobs in the world: the one that makes the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame race, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and we believe in life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of a mint pill ad, but despite that — or maybe because of that — the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (bollo) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The ad company that made the video, BBH, harbors the hope that with the ad they manage to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill their “national duty.”
This is something purely of the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt this was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing fast-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do as creatively as possible to solve this problem, which is composing a rap?
1.2 children
The one who does not take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore’s birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 – known as the replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, says it is due to “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in singleness, and to the delay in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, a U.S. immigration policy aims to dramatically increase immigration to cope with the population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia abounds barely disguised against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who criticize for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore’s ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has started to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has gone on to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoeboxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there are concerns that they may promote a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, familiar homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units run out of days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules give clearer guidance to developers, who were previously being put in a loop if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too Stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the center seems unlikely to have much effect.
“People are very stressed, homes are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing it,” says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But for me it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, the stress and cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
The private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is about the quality of private or "the area of private life that has the right to protect itself from any interference".
What is private for a child under 16?
How does this definition apply to your daily life and social media?
Do you understand the dangers that you are exposed to by venting on the Internet situations that you would surely not share offline?
the Journal interviewed five boys between ten and 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", on the personal level, and "in the key and name of the user", when applied to social networks.
“My deepest secrets wouldn’t put them in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of privacy on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
“They’re very secretive, my mom can meet them, but not everyone,” she says.
On FB I upload beautiful or game images.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that’s not mine, or someone who’s making the ridiculous,” he says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, of naked people, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're answering me, I'm just bringing them up," he adds.
“Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly,” she says.
Do not hesitate to answer that you would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't mind anyone recommending it to a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14 years old, is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter admits not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
“It doesn’t scare me, because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one has been hinted at or asked for the address of his house or phone number.
“If they pressured me or demanded me just take the bags out of my account,” he admits.
Joseph became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of my friend was blackmailing him on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“I never knew who he was,” he said.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
“I just gave you privacy.”
Then explain a number of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
I'd do it, if I'm bad or I'm greedy.
“I know that’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites changed the rules of the game,” he says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, a master’s degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we’re still learning,” he says.
He comments that the topic is complex, “because we are asking them to have a defined criterion about what is appropriate or not to disseminate, publish or tell an age that maturity does not give for that.”
“They’re also selective when what matters most is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences.”
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is through questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it is not helpful,” he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like me to post a photo of you as the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you tag holiday photos, did you ask permission from other people to tag them?
And one more thing, do they all need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act on line as they do off line.
They are the same rules.
“An outsider on the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, just as it should be on social media,” he says.
Surveillance (disambiguation)
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential for parents to be aware of social media policies.
By understanding each of the incisors they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers."
Finalizes Summit of Unasur without making the Lima Declaration public
The 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Declaration of Lima, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant mandaters.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources from the Chancellery and the Presidency pointed out at a beginning that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but later stated that at some point it will be published on the Government's website.
On being consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by Peru’s president, Ollanta Humala, during brief press statements.
Journalists' access to the Summit's information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the soundless video of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information circulated among reporters was delivered by the press spokespersons of some of the governments of UNASUR attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media asking for more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an email to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but it is about the statement of Humala, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently demanded by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which they had previously announced, was also not released.
On the official ASPA website it can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made every effort to ensure that transmission systems were secure for all journalists, but limited information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with Chile and Peru’s joint commitment to accept a ruling by the Hague Court that states a border difference between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both sides, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
“We will abide by and execute the ruling that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today,” Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country respectful of international law, of the peaceful resolution of disputes, of treaties and of international courts,” added Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, and greeted Humala with a handshake, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> Pact for which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of that international court, following a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered gravely wrong.
The summit was held with the inconsistencies of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not attend the appointment.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action for 31 projects were set among South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, UNASUR countries will take “significant steps toward the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the residency agreements.”
He said that actions are being taken to improve “cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-cost internet access in all corners of South America, and to jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters.”
With a Europe in crisis, “the economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples,” Humala added.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," he said in a message read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although it did not give greater details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and of good relations among neighbors, was another issue underscored by the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he expected to meet with his Nicaraguan couple, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime difference in a respectful way after a decision by the ICJ, questioned by Bogot<0xC3><0xA1>.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) is likely to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these roads, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
“With President Ortega, I hope I can tell you that we are handling this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the leadership of the new president of that country, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers previously met to approve the 2013 Plan of Action, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay join UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland."
He defended, in that sense, the project of establishing South American citizenship that encouraged UNASUR member countries.
“We have to get free mobility of citizens and workers by any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past,” he said.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favour of the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San Jose pact on human rights.
Those who give a PhD never commit to anything and instead we South Americans sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding,” said Julian Assange, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he is not sorry for that decision because it has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his “deep democratic and human rights values.”
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and his process was not respected."
He also criticized the Swedish justice system for demanding that it be questioned in its territory for an alleged sexual offence when "the Swedish legislation itself allows it to be carried out through videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa said there is a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health will deteriorate.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,” he said.
What is certain is the danger of deteriorating your physical and mental health by being locked up in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“That complicates the health of anyone,” he added.
Correa pointed out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting him a safe-conduct allowing him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities, and stressed that there has been talks with London in search of a solution to the leak.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant conversations.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n, is conducting a series of proceedings in different European courts,” he said.
And he said, “If Britain gives tomorrow the safe way, this will end.”
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, questions Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or questions him via Skype tomorrow this problem will be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that what he does not tolerate is “mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression.”
“The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and wicked politicians but the bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In that regard, he welcomed the fact that these journalists are no longer “either the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador”, and he said that if re-elected he would “deepen in the revolution to continue the path and the right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to keep the Paraguayan veto on Unasur at least until his next election, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and law-enforced coup" because it actually "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president also considered “perfectly relevant” the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, that decision is not adhered to.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be extensively processed in order to overcome them and move forward.
He also confided in a good conclusion of the maritime border dispute that they hold in the same court of Peru and Chile and said that “it is right for Latin America to seek international jurisdiction if the two countries commit to accept judgment however hard it may be.”
Referring to the eventuality presented as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he noted that he sees that possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador’s, that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
“My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
To win would be my last term in the presidency and from there we come out of public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
“It doesn’t mean a relapse in President Chavez’s state of health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are the cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed to have tested positive for AIDS.
"It was as if I fell a bomb," he says, recalling the moment of the announcement, which the doctor tried to make "softer", without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care only of his illness and began to inform himself about it; with such a commitment that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him “because he was bringing a cut.”
So, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, unaware of their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, “overwhelmed” their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the onset of AIDS in the world, at least in the first reported cases, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who initiates timely treatment and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HCG HIV Unit, in a press release.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, the scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affect to the immune system that patients present at the start of the diagnosis, with a maximum of 50 years of drug use.
In simple words, the above means that those who receive the diagnosis of HIV positive at the age of 25, under these terms "while in control will be able to live without problems until the age of 75," the interviewee explained.
To measure this progress, it is worth remembering that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS dropped from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths as of May this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I visualize it, that's how it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had enough medication the problem is that patients get very advanced because they do not know their infection status, i.e. in late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already present some opportunistic infection what they have to do to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make diagnoses earlier and therefore have to offer massively detection tests to all people who require it.”
In his proposal, specialists and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida) coincide, also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to take the test in a particular laboratory, only motivated because a friend had done it and, despite his short age, was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered from a sarcoma like Ka's cancer.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die, I’d better go back three times a week,” they say no in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take the medication.
To date, her parents only know she had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like anyone else.
“I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active but co-responsible sex life, I take care of myself and the other person,” said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, as part of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
The test, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, is better and if they already have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the motto of the battle for AIDS this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
The gaps between health programs and the common citizen are great, said Ricardo Salazar, a Tapatio journalist who has taken over the cause around HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task “the distribution of condoms has actually increased, we were given one or two before, now we are given packages of one hundred, and that’s fine but it turns out that some people today, still, do not have access to a condom,” he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
“What do you want them for?” is a common question, with sorority and value judgments from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health care workers, to which teenagers do not want to be exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that the condoms are not just behind the counters, and that one hundred of them are in the public bathroom dispatchers of the sites frequented by young people.
It’s not about motivating promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying them the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez replied, when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms in his Administration.
“That’s not sexuality, it’s best to approach condoms to those who already practice sexual activity,” she said.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is 4th national in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV since for a registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by a U.S. Court of Appeals ruling that does not know the restructuring of the Vitro Group debt achieved through a commercial tender in Mexico, the scenario sets a bad precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would be said, therefore, that the procedures in favour of the survival of the signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, as opposed to international conventions.
On the practical ground, the backlash to the ruling issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the northern district of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties all over the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming three inconsistencies.
At the outset, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says the main procedure is the commercial tender processed in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
To that end, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created, and the American Law Institute was placed as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial tender the debts that the subsidiaries of Vitro had with their parent company, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, that of Vitro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Mexican Commercial, whose intercompany debts were evaluated by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The truth, moreover, is that remaining the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the US Courts, i.e. the “buitre” funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The case is dismissed by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, this blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 on the eve of the severe economic crisis that the United States faced, taking the collections to the country.
Soon, the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada family’s signature will file a reconsideration appeal before the appeals court itself for the vote to reach its full, i.e. the five judges, since only three voted.
Failure to do so will result in Cerciorare’s appeal requiring a review of the process by a higher court, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court of Justice.
The serious thing about the case is that the court filed a document sent by the Mexican government under the form of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competitions Act, noting that it was unsealed in attachment to the agreements signed by both countries with the Bancar de la Estados and the Bancar de la Estados.
Moreover, it is pointed out that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambola of two bands: they stick to Vitro and stick to the country.
Balance General
After sleeping for several months the complaints placed on the table by the Mexican aviation unions against the company’s ex-owner, Gaston Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Association of Aviator Pilots has already found the bottleneck.
The court headed by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the trust F/589 of Bank IXE, on behalf of Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channelled to the purchase of shares from the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Searching for Dragon Mart
Gathered this weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal sales and distribution center facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with a living area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeastern area to oppose the monumental thing that razed some of the protected areas and raised the mother of all the hideouts against the industry.
ACTA is dead.
Under the government’s request from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances Mexico’s ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-False Trade Agreement, known by its English acronym as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the file.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility of considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social media.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes basketball worlds were linked to the sport of table tennis for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of local basketball as wide as Hector "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, he was as a minor category player, player of the National Higher Basketball, holder and leader in the BSN with the Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
“I put a lot of hats on basketball through my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s,” Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball has been my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate when making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his vast trajectory, so testify.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
Of all, the most thrilling are those who remember his passage through the Cowboys from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old acting as a co-owner or a franchise owner.
“Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, whether as a power, co-power or leader.
There were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year at the BSN.
From there he took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), telling me, "I have a very strong player, 6" 7" tall.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was born and was one of our best shooters.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The Vaqueros championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but it was already at a distance, as by 1988 it was already a federal mandate.
For that time he preferred to enjoy his executors and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we first won the U.S. at the 1989 Pre-Olympic Games in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and it must have been bronze not by that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that 1990 World Cup group the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a fur to the United States team, which was pretty similar to the one we won bronze in the world.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter young, the brothers Le<0xC3><0xB3>n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90's.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role-playing players like “Canito” Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of players suspended by the plight of the Panamericano de Mar del Plata, we won gold against all forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that was Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
Their numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculin did.
And that without counting his career in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Boricua leader?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young people, I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things that I would have wanted to implement, such as regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, Ponce's boys would only play in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the result of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, board officials and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
All I do is listen to music, watch music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon from cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the "Dallas" production house.
“Larry was back in her beloved Dallas hometown, again representing the iconic role she liked the most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an original person and lived life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995 he was found to have a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at his home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971–72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included well-received roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly hateful J.R. that led Hagman to his maximum stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase “Who shot J.R.?”, designed to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman’s character is nearly killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risked in gambling houses.
He also helped give the series a record audience at the time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it and made Dallas the second most-watched entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to cut her off as a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman portrayed Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a treacherous businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), interned.
“I know what I want in J.R.’s tombstone,” Hagman said in 1988.
He should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he has lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as someone "enormous, inside and out of the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, that we were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
The recording of five of the chapters for the second season had already been completed and a sixth was under way, the chain reported.
There was no immediate statement from Warner or TNT on how the series will handle Hagman’s loss.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had him in 1931 during his marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He proved successful in New York theater in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t put anything there that I thought was going to hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told the Associated Press at the time.
After liver transplantation he became a promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
“I advise them, give them value, meet them when they come for their surgeries, and then,” he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short while, but they'll be fine."
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible yearning: The end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan Calendar, December 21, to which many people have been clinging as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charme had no idea what he expected in the next couple of months: Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "debtmagedon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where late-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has been,” Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you analyze what has been going on in the world today as if we were 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he’s not the only teacher who offers courses on the “end of the world” this semester, in theory the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World”.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
“I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled “The End of the World.”
"We don't add '2012' to always count on the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the “imminent ruin,” students must study, generate projects, and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work “until the same night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
“It saturated in two hours,” Restall said of his high-average student course, which was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
The students, for their part, say that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old career student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing career student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
“I had never heard of a class that could teach that,” he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But no student interviewed — let alone a teacher — said they believed in the December 21 deadline.
“Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy and in a way we discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old last-year student at Temple and West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a surge of speculation.
“Otherwise people don’t think about it,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question of whether he knew about any course on the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote, insinuating an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start thinking immediately on the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they were planning to go to “the end of the world” parties.
“Maybe call some friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
