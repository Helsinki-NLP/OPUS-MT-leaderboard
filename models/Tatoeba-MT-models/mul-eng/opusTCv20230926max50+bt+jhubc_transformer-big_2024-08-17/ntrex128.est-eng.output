Members of the National Assembly of Wales are afraid they look like Muppet
Some of the members of the National Assembly have abstained from the recommendation to change their designation to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament or Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The theme has been the beginning of a plan to change the name of the National Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Representatives of all political trends in the National Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
One member of the National Assembly, a member of the camp campers, said that his groupmates were concerned because it echoed the words “Twp and Pwp”.
To explain to readers outside Wales: the word daft means sticky and pwp means cake.
A member of the plaid said that the whole group as a whole “is not happy” and has offered other names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "responsible" in the name change, but noted that the word "MWP" was very similar to the word "Muppet".
For the explanation: in k<0xC3><0xA4>mri, the pronunciation of the star w is similar to the pronunciation of Yorkshire in English u.
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a bill on the name change, said: “Of course, the members themselves will make the final decision on all the appointments with which the members of the National Assembly are invited.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public inquiry into the name proposals, which broadly supported the idea of renaming the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
When it came to the appointment of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the name ‘Wales Members of Parliament, or WMP’, but the respondents in the public poll favoured the most variant ‘MWP’.
Members of the Assembly are likely to come up with other names, but reaching an agreement may prove tempting to President Elin Jones, who is expected to make changes to the draft law in the coming weeks.
The reform act also includes other changes to the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules on the withdrawal of the rights of members of the National Assembly and the establishment of a committee system.
The final vote on the appointment of the members of the National Assembly will be left to the members themselves during the legislative debate.
Macedonian people are organizing a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to rename their country “the Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum is being held with the aim of resolving decades-long disputes with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that its name represents a demand for this territory and has repeatedly objected to the candidature of the EU and NATO members.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the change of name, has said that he intends to reject the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, argue, however, that the name change is only the price the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's clocks are silent because the churches of Harlem are struggling
“The older people I’ve talked to have said that there was one bar and one church on every corner,” Adams said.
“There’s not either of them.”
He said that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People are communicating differently today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living quarters of the neighborhood where people are staying every day.”
As for the churches, however, he worries that the money available from the sale of assets will not go on as long as the leaders hope, and “ sooner or later they will be back in the beginning.”
Adams added that churches can be replaced by apartment houses, whose apartments are full of people who do not reach the rest of the neighborhood with help from the sanctuary.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he added, “who therefore accelerate the arrival of this day when all these churches close their doors because it is unlikely that most of the people who live here will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The original congregation of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
The congregation of blacks, who had so far worshipped God nearby, took over the ownership of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was occupied by a congregation of African-Americans led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott against the main shopping street of 125th Street, Harlem, when they refused to hire or promote blacks.
In the fire of 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when members of Father Johnson’s congregation planned to rebuild the building, they used a carillon, or clockwork.
Father Johnson's son and heir to St Martin's Church, Reverend David Johnson proudly called the carillon "the watches of the brave".
But in July, the expert who played the game gave it a different name: "cultural value" and "an irreplaceable historical tool".
Tiffany Ng Michigan University also noted that it is the world’s first black-and-white coffin played by musician Dionysius A. Lind, who continued to play a larger coffin at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that the Church of St. Martin did not replace him.
In recent months, the playwright in St. Martin’s Church has been a story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved in the church’s secular leaders, other bishops.
In July, the church’s governing body, which was made up of secular leaders, told the bishop in writing that the bishopric was “trying to pass on costs”, although the bishopric was not even involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the bishopric.
Some of the members of the assembly complained about the poor transparency of the Bishop’s actions.
In California, a 13-year-old boy was stabbed to death by a shark
Authorities said the shark was attacked and injured by a 13-year-old boy who drowned in California on the opening day of the homing season for the hominids.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he and his friends had been diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's assistants and then swimming with others to help the boy pull out of the water.
At first, he thought that the boy expressed his enthusiasm for receiving the hombre, but “then he realized that the boy was shouting ‘I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
His whole body was naked," Hammel described the sight of what he saw when he reached the boy.
"I asked everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water,'" Hammel added.
In a life-threatening condition, the boy was taken by plane to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The species of attacked shark is still unknown.
Water rescuer and captain Larry Giles told a press conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but then it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were at the top of the body.
For research and security purposes, the authorities closed access to Ponto Beach, located in Ecinitas, from Casablanca to Swamini, for 48 hours.
Giles added that there are more than 135 shark species in the region, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take power in the UK beauty products market
Sainsbury’s takes over the chains of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, creating supermarket-like beauty product exchanges where expert advisors also work.
As part of a significant <0xC2><0xA3>2.7 billion stake in the UK’s beauty market, which continues to be on the rise as fashion and home goods sales continue to decline, the wider range of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country, with the successful launch of next year’s bags.
The reason why supermarkets are investing in beauty products is that they are looking for ways to make use of the shelf space previously allocated to TVs, microwaves and home goods.
Sainsbury said it plans to double its range of beauty products to up to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
Existing product choices from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in brands such as currently available in Boots stores.
The supermarket also re-launches its make-up series Boutique, in which the majority of products are suitable for vegans, as young shoppers demand more and more.
Fragrance Shop is also testing the perfume retailer’s retail license in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second will open this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping online and switching to everyday shopping for small amounts of food from local food stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has said that outlets are becoming more and more similar to supermarkets, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight against such cheap-selling chains as Aldi and Lidl, providing more services and industrial goods.
In Sainsbury, Argos has put stores in hundreds of stores. The same has been done with Habitati sales outlets, as in Sainsbury bought both chains two years ago, which has allegedly supported the sale of food items and made acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to upgrade its beauty and treatment products departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury attempted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended up arguing over how to distribute the proceeds from the sale of pharmacy goods in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its 281 sons to the pharmaceutical industry three years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, which owns the entire Lloyds Pharmacy business.
Lloyds also plays a role in the strategy by adding luxury skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to its four store product range.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s business manager, said: “We’ve changed the appearance and nature of our beauty product transitions to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also spent money on specially trained workers who are always ready to advise.
Our brand choice meets every need. The attractive environment and convenient locations mean, however, that we are now a competitive beauty trade destination, which can change the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones says he's a marauder because Holly Willoughby quits 11 million female deals
Dragons Deni star Peter Jones left “awesomely” when television host Holly Willoughby abandoned a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal in her lifestyle brand business to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby takes the time for the brand of home goods and clothing Truly.
A few businesses have compared Gwyneth Paltrow to Goop.
The 37-year-old head of the television show "This Morning" announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones angry, stepping out of their luxury lifestyle brand activity at the last minute to focus on her new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was “marvelous” when a television star admitted at a tense meeting that took place on Tuesday at a man’s business empire headquarters in Marlows Buckinghamshire that her new contracts worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million meant that a woman’s penis was no longer fit for a penis.
The business has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK for one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s main preference.
It had to secure his distant future, so the woman thought she was dealing with it for the next couple of decades.
His decision to leave left everything in complete disarray about the matter.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, because it was so close to the launch of the product range.
Marlow's main apartment has a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that the departure of one of the UK’s most paid celebrities from the television show “This Morning” could cost the company millions, because in products that range from sofa beds and candles to clothes and home appliances, a total amount of money is invested into the market.
It could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016. 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as president in March.
Couples go on holiday together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby becomes M&S brand ambassador and he replaces Ant McPartlin in the ITV television series "I'm A Celebrity".
A source close to Jones said last night, “I don’t want to comment on his particular case.”
It’s hard to say, “Why I fell in love.”
Trump joked about criticism in the news for what some consider to be “worthy of the president” and overreliance on North Korea’s head of state.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his somewhat “news anchor voice”:
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in the second meeting after Trump welcomed their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the abandonment of North Korea’s nuclear weapons.
However, negotiations on nuclear deterrence have stalled.
More than three months after a summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea sees no “response” to North Korea’s initial disarming patterns.
He added that the U.S. will continue to impose pressure on the country.
Trump’s motivational point of view was much happier.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“North Korea is at war.
Millions of people would have died.
It’s all very well between us now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought good results: there have been completed rocket attacks, helped to free hostages and organized to bring the American servants to their homeland.
He also defended his unusual relationship with Kim.
“Being president is very simple, but instead of letting 10,000 people wait outside to get to this full-time stadium, it’s better if we have nearly 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd standing in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy Indonesian island, killing hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population had to be resettled, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have often expressed very clearly that they do not want international assistance, so the stories are a bit complicated," Ms Sumbang said.
While the organization Save the Children is putting together a team that would go to Palus, it is not yet clear whether foreigners can work in the region.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palus to decide whether international authorities are allowed to contribute to the aid.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country has surprisingly little preparation for dealing with natural forces.
Although Aceh has been built to protect against the tsunami, it is not particularly widespread in other coastal areas.
Although a tsunami warning was issued, the apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren increased the number of people likely to be killed.
Traveling between Indonesia's numerous islands is also quite tempting in the best of times.
Natural disasters are making this logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship stopped in Lombok for the treatment of victims of the earthquake is heading to Palus, but it takes at least three days to reach the new site of the accident.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia’s broken infrastructure a central part of his election campaign and he has distributed money on roads and railways.
However, budget deficits threaten Mr Joko's government, as the new elections are set to take place next year.
Mr Jokot is also pressuring the tensions in Indonesia among the separatists, where members of the Muslim-majority Muslim community have turned to the older form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes due to the fighting between Christian and Muslim forces on the streets, using machetes, vibes and arrows and other basic weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge beats Chelsea in a tie-break game
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League, tying for the 89th minute of the game at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge was fed by Xherdan Shaqir, being about 27 yards from Chelsea's gate when his team led 1-0.
He shot the ball to the left before shooting it in the direction of a far-off post.
The ball flew high over the penalty area and hit the right upper corner of the net.
It fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabala and crashed into the net.
“I was just trying to get into that position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq are giving the ball as much as possible, so I was just trying to win for myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kant coming, made one touch, and gave a long, thoughtless blow.”
At the end of the first half, Chelsea led 1-0 thanks to the knock of Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In this game, the Blues striker fed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before turning around in the middlefield and feeding Liverpool.
Kovacic gave a quick meal in the middle of the night.
Then he made a nice dinner, leading Hazard to the penalty area.
Hazard got through the defense and made the ball to the left of Liverpool player Alisson Becker away from the net.
Liverpool will play for Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in a UEFA Euro League match on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the country’s disaster department said on Sunday morning.
Hulk people were trapped on Friday and 18-meter-long waves of lightning brought about by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake under the rubble of collapsed buildings, the agency’s spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a news conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was covered under collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man after stabbing a woman in death
The murder investigation was started after a woman's body was found this morning in Merseyside, Birkenhead.
A 44-year-old woman's body was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are calling for people in the area to contact them who may have seen or heard something.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still quite early, but I would ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and heard or saw anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask all taxi drivers, especially those whose on-board cameras could have stored something, to contact us as they may have crucial information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman found in one of the buildings was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, a woman’s alleged friends came to the scene and asked questions about where the woman was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they are informing the woman's relatives at the moment.
Grayson, a taxi driver living in Mews, wanted to go back to the apartment, but police told him that no one could enter or leave the house.
The man was shocked when he heard the incident.
Residents were told that getting back to their homes could take hours.
The police officer told one man that the whole area was now being treated as a crime scene.
One woman was in tears at the scene.
He always said, “That’s terrible.”
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police buses were still closed in the area and the third was right next to it.
Hulk police officers stood in the area and watched the apartment building.
Anyone who has information about the event will be asked to send a direct message to the <0x40>MerPolCC account, call number 101, or contact Crimestopper anonymously on 0800 555 111 using the September 30 login code 247.
The shape of Parliament's Cromwell is the last monument that is the cause of the "rewriting of history" dispute
The removal of this would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious objects in the Taliban style by the man's inhumane vagrants.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's recommendation as foolishness and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “At the time, it was impossible to leave the memorial in front of Oliver Cromwell’s Westminster Palace intact.
Cromwell did not take pictures of himself in the English Civil War, nor did he tell others to do so.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell man's ancestor, Thomas, was sacrificed for the deeds of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s excellent presentation of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the historical record of the person to whom a number of people are still supposed to show respect.”
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “A lot of people at the end of the 19th century considered Cromwell to be a defender of external pressure and, in this case, of course, of royal power.
Whether this is an accurate reflection is an endless historical dispute.
It is certain that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our people, and Cromwell clearly represents this divide on one side.
His achievements as the Lord’s Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered.”
Chinese farmer stabbed to death with sledgehammer
According to local media reports, a pig farmer who killed a man was attacked on the market in South China.
The man, who was identified only by the surname Yuan, was found dead with injured artefacts and covered with blood near the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, South China's Morning Post reported on Sunday.
Production of seedlings on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, to vaccinate pigs on its table.
He had reportedly come on Wednesday from his cousin's neighbouring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the man's cousin found him dead and discovered that the adjoining hatch was open.
He said that the seasullus was a large blood-mouthed orchid.
A forensic study confirmed that 249.47 kilograms of ore had been reported to have resulted in the death of a farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were all bloody and bruised,” said Wu, a cousin of the victim’s “Guiyang Evening News.”
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to John or his sister-in-law.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so that it could not attack anyone else until the police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and market leaders are reportedly discussing the payment of compensation for the man’s death.
Although rare, it has also been observed in the past that seals attack people.
In 2016, a pig woman and her husband attacked their Massachusetts farm. The man was severely injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 294.83 kilograms was hauled by a Welsh farmer’s tractor until the man’s wife scared the animal away.
When one Oregon farmer ate his own seed in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the seed usually doesn’t attack, but because of the taste of blood, it can go away.
“They’re just gamers.
They are very curious maracrats, whose purpose is not to hurt.
You just have to tell a lot of stories,” the man said.
Hurricane Rosa's aftershocks bring extensive rain showers in the western United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens, moving across Mexico’s northern coast toward cooler waters.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding storms to northern Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
According to the time of the east coast at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, Rosa classified the first category hurricane with winds of 136.78 kilometers per hour, located 619.59 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move further north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure environment begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving east toward the US west coast. When Rosa approaches the tropical storm on Monday on Baja California Peninsula, it begins to direct deep tropical moisture toward the western United States.
On Monday, Rosa arrives in Mexico, where it rains up to 25.4 centimeters.
Then, with the approaching low pressure, the tropical humidity in the south-east of the country will cause extensive heavy rainfall in the coming days.
Locally, 2.54 to 10.16 centimetres of rain is caused by dangerous sudden thunderstorms, floodwaters, and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes an increase in rainfall of five to about seven and a half centimetres per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected to rain between 5.08 and 10.16 centimetres in certain areas of the southern United States, particularly in Arizona.
Emergencies are possible due to the dispersal of tropical rains with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
You should definitely not walk in the desert in the event of the threat of tropical rainforests.
A strong rain can cause canyons to turn into fast-flowing rivers, and thunderstorms are accompanied by occasional wind gusts and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure environment sometimes brings with it acute rainfall on the southern California coast.
It is possible to have a total amount of rainfall that exceeds 1.27 centimeters and can cause lower floodwaters and muddy you.
During the rainy season, this would be the region’s first harvest.
Dispersed tropical rain showers begin to approach Arizona on Sunday night and early Monday morning, with rainfall becoming extensive on Monday night and Tuesday.
Heavy rain showers will reach Four Corner on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, high temperature fluctuations in the U.S. caused by the cooling of the Arctic are predicted, while temperatures remain high in tropical areas.
Sometimes this leads to large temperature changes in small areas.
Sunday weather is an excellent example of significant temperature differences in the central United States.
Temperature differences between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) reach nearly 20 degrees.
In the next few days, he tries to collect himself again in the long summer heat.
A large part of the central and eastern United States is expected to expect a warm beginning of October, with temperatures ranging around 80 degrees Fahrenheit, from the south to the country's northeast.
In New York, 26.6 degrees of heat is expected on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that in the eastern part of the U.S. there is a probability of high average temperatures occurring in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial saw more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched the confessions of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who allegedly accused her of sexual assault in the 1980s, through six television channels.
At the same time, a political blockade continued, in which broadcasters stopped showing regular broadcasts on Friday to reflect the last-minute twists: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake drafted a contract for the FBI to hold a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had grabbed him by the head and tried to take off the woman's clothes at the end of high school.
Kavanaugh said in his fervent confession that he is absolutely sure that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen’s report, more than 20.4 million people were likely to watch the transmission on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems with calculating the number of people who view transfers in the authorities.
By comparison, it can be said that it is about the same size of audience as the football in the final tournament games or in the division of the Oscars.
Fox News Channel opinion leaders, who have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers in a day-long session, Nielsen said.
With 3.26 million viewers, ABC took second place.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
There was a lot of interest after the trial.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After a moderate Republican office made a statement that it was voting for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras hit the man on Friday morning when he had fallen under the influence of whistleblowers, trying to go to a committee meeting with a lift.
He stood on the ground for several minutes when he was charged and transferred directly to CNN.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
She was told, “You have power, while so many women are fully empowered.”
Flake said that his department issued a statement and added before the elevator was closed that he had more to say at the hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
Cable and radio networks reflected a live broadcast several hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to send Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate for a further vote.
But Flake said he only does so in the understanding that the FBI is investigating the charges filed against the candidate next week, which have been demanded by the Democrats in the minority.
Flake was partly convinced by a conversation with a Democrat friend of Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had an impact, as it was obvious that the Republicans could not get Kavanaugh's vote together without the confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump launched an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's accusations.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of political game
In an interview with the Sunday Times, the prime minister accused those considering his plans to leave the European Union of "political play" on Britain's future and of undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson pressured her attack on May to so-called the Brexit roadmap, saying the proposal on which Britain and the EU should collect each other’s tariffs is “completely brainy.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Murdering LSU Player
Police arrested a man suspected of shooting dead 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and placed in prison on second-degree murder charges, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released a video of the opposition between Sims and Simpson. Police added that Sims lost his glasses during a fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA, CBS news channel WAFB reported.
After Simpson's interrogation, police said the man confessed to shooting Wayde dead.
The lawyer said the man's bail was set at $350,000 ($308,600.30).
The East Baton Rouge coroner issued an initial report on Friday, which said the head of the neck area was the cause of death from a gunshot wound to the head.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Refugee Task Force, the State Police Criminology Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the people living in the area for the help provided in the investigation, which led to a suspicious arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the region’s law enforcement agencies for “setting up care and justice on the move”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre-high man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball in LSU.
The average of his last season's games was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the entire team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“It’s something you worry about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano pursing ash from Mexico City
Popocatepetl volcanic ash has reached the southernmost parts of the city of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday, ordering them to keep away from the volcano, as the crater resumed operations, resulting in a 24-hour record of 183 cases of gas emissions and desertification.
The center was covered with several seams and colors.
The images shared on social media depicted a car with a thousand-covered windows in various parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilcos.
Geophysicists observed an increase in volcanic activity located 72 km from the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The Don Goyo volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after a clash between supporters of independence and whistleblowers, with thousands joining in opposing demonstrations to celebrate Catalonia’s opposition to the vote on the withdrawal.
A group of masked separatist fighters, held back by the wet police, attacked with the latest eggs and powder paints, creating thick dust clouds on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
Rumors also arose later, when police had to use needles to control the cracks.
For several hours, supporters of independence chanting "No Forgetting, No Forgiveness" met with supporters of the unity of the country, who shouted "Lost in Spain!".
According to the local press, 14 people who received minor injuries were given medical assistance.
Tensions continue to rise in the area of independence a year later, when Madrid declared the referendum to be illegal on 1 October, but what the Catalans in favor of secession did.
Voters overwhelmingly voted in favour of independence, even though the electoral activity was low, as the opposition parties rejected the vote to a large extent.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to block the vote in front of the entire region's polling stations, which led to violent clashes.
Proponents of independence had spent the night in front of the polling stations on Friday night in order to avoid statements in support of the state police.
However, the demonstrations took place, but they had to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the declaration of separation with his wife, said he no longer has any hope of seeing Catalonia as an independent state.
“Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I saw my parents crying for joy at the opportunity to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite an important but small victory in the regional elections held in December of last year, it has been difficult for the Catalan independence-supporting parties to maintain the mandate this year, as many of the most famous leaders have either gone to the sidelines themselves or have been detained and are awaiting a hearing on their part.
42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who is recording a statement in support of police with her mobile phone, said the fight was sparked by politicians from both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he will participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Applying for the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and pressure from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested for ramming house by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the Londonderry car repeatedly rammed the house.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective detective Bob Blemmings said the damage was done to the gates and the building.
You could also put a vibuno in the direction of the car at some point.
Livingston will win 1–0 against Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first gate for Livingston won
Livingston advanced the Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to a second loss in 18 games, when the man has been the manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot proved decisive when Gary Holt raised the level to Hibernian in a second.
Gerrard will remain undefeated in the first league this season and face the leading Hearts on Sunday, with eight points on the ground.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Euroleague on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston expanded his undefeated attack to seven games, while head coach Holt still felt the taste of loss since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingston Loses Opportunity Against N<0xC3><0xBC>rhein Visitors
Holt's team should have been in charge long before the goal was scored, as their direct playing style caused Rangers any sort of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts ran out in front of the gate, where Alan Lithgow made efforts to hit Craig Halkett's head over the gate.
The wrestlers calmly let Rangers play in front of themselves, knowing that they may cause problems for guests in certain places.
And that's also the way the gate was hit.
The Rangers gave up a free kick, and Livingston was given the opportunity to play Declan Gallagher, Robinson, and Menga, who took the ball and managed to get it from the penalty area.
By this time, the Rangers were mainly in possession of the ball, but were unable to break through the defense, making the gatekeeper Liam Kelly's side mostly calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the gate once.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor avoided Scott Pittman's strike, and Lithgow shone brightly in Livingston's next team effort.
The strikers reached Livingston's penalty area and were consistently beaten away, and two penalty kicks, one for Halkett's attempt to replace Glenn Middleton, and the other for touching the ball with a hand.
Phenomenal achievement from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was excellent, exceeding the line-up by fully moving up the expectations.
Their playing style and players have barely changed since returning to the top level, but Holt needs to be honored for how he has been bullied since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was huge, organizing a superbly organized defense, while I was held by Connor Goldson and Joe Worral throughout the game on the back legs.
But the Rangers were excited.
Despite their intermediate good standing under Gerrard's leadership, there was little left of this, according to the examples here.
Their last possession of the ball proved to be inadequate: the arrival of the home side took place only once, which could act as an alarm clock for the Rangers in the center of the table.
Erdogan's controversial reception in Cologne
In Berlin on Saturday (September 29th) there were both smiles and a cloud of worry when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have been left out on issues relating to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
Police called for security, banning the gathering of 25,000 members of the population in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters appeared close to it to see their president.
Hundreds against Erdogan, many of whom are Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to alienate the Turkish president in his country.
The conflicting statements show that the attitude towards the guest has disintegrated: some Turks living in Germany greet him as a hero, while others despise him as a self-governing man.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: cyclist killed by car as a result of collision
In London, a bicycle wrecked against a car was killed.
The crash took place on a high-speed road near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street intersection in Deptford, in the south of the city at about 10:15 a.m. according to British Summer Time.
The driver stopped and the ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred a few months after the second cyclist died in a collision nearly two kilometres from Saturday's crash site on Childers Street, where the driver who was riding the wheel ran away from the scene.
London police said the authorities were involved in identifying the man and informing his relatives.
At the scene of the event, traffic is closed and buses are diverted, motor vehicle drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartini prison: six prison officers were injured in clashes
The prison authorities reported that six prison officers were found to be very safe to be injured in the riots in the men's prison.
His Majesty's Long Lartini prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at 9:30 a.m. local time after British summer time has not yet ended.
Welcoming police officers from experts are involved in dealing with one of the gang of conspiracies linked to eight inmates.
Inmates were treated for milder facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Prisoners with special training have been invited to resolve the ongoing case in HMP Long Lartini prison.
Five crew members were medically assisted due to injuries.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and their prison sentence may be extended.”
HMP Long Lartini has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the warden was taken to hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, however, wetland police were called to the prison to silence serious calms during which prison officials were attacked with pooled bullets.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with an emergency (may be beneficial for hurricane areas)
Tropical low temperatures don’t hit Arizona often, but it’s likely to happen early next week as a severe hurricane Rosa moves across the U.S.’s southwest desert, bringing a sudden threat.
The National Weather Service has already organized emergency monitoring on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast, Rosa will head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area as early as Monday with rain showers.
According to the Phoenix National Weather Service, “Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or low-pressure level of 321.86 km from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 64.37 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict a rainfall of between 5.08 and 10.16 centimeters, which can reach a maximum of 15.24 centimeters in the restricted areas of the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
In other parts of the U.S. desert, including central Kaljum<0xC3><0xA4>estik and the Great Consensus, rainfall is likely between 2.54 and 5.08 centimeters, reaching a maximum of 10.16 centimeters in restricted areas.
In the event of an emergency, Rosa's rain may be a blessing, as the region is struggling with drought.
While floods are very worrisome, such a rainy season is likely to be beneficial as well, as in South America, the West prevails.
According to a U.S. drill monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is extreme, the size of the second category of drills, weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa Baja crosses the California Peninsula in the Mexican mainland.
Rosa, who was still at the hurricane level at 6.43 km/h on Sunday morning, is currently 619.95 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving at a speed of 19.31 km/h to the north.
The storm is associated with the cool waters of the Pacific Ocean and therefore is a bit wobbly.
Rosa is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the afternoon, with the intensity of a tropical storm.
The amount of rainfall in certain areas of Mexico can be high, bringing with it a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to Sonora, we can expect rain showers totaling 7.62 to 15.24 centimeters, reaching up to 25.4 centimeters,” weather.com said in a statement.
Rosa then heads over to Mexico’s tropical storm north, reaching the Arizona border as early as Tuesday morning as a tropical low-pressure group that moves over Arizona and reaches southern Utah late on Tuesday night.
"The main threat that follows Rosa or its aftermath is a very strong rainfall in Baja California, Sonora Bay and the U.S. Southwest Desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rain showers can cause life-threatening sudden floods and flooding in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests linked to murder charge
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer in Norton on Sunday at 04:00 British summer time.
The victim was taken to a “stable” hospital.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officials are requested to contact anyone who may have a case of mobile phone recordings.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffering” the Democratic Party “under suspicion and anger”
"Judge Kavanaugh's support is a vote against the Democratic Party's merciless and unacceptable tactics," Trump said in a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was “suffering” during the process of appointing the Democratic Party “under suspicion and anger.”
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, dismissing the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford, according to which the man attacked her forty years ago when they were teenagers.
He also testified at the hearing on his charges against Ford.
The president said on Saturday that “America saw Kavanaugh’s glory, quality, and courage that day.”
The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the most valuable legislators of our time, with an indisputable background in public service," he told a crowd in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while speaking at the same time on the importance of the republic's electoral activity in the interim elections.
“Five weeks have remained one of the most important choices of our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I’m a candidate,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to “stand up and stop.”
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, Republican Party leaders' senior aide to CNN said.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, the death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed and many others were threatened when the tsunami hit the beach after a severe earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi Island in Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach festival in Palu city on Friday, when six-meter waves made the beach, killed a number of people and destroyed everything that was left on the road.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the beach and did not immediately escape, remaining so victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a press conference held in Jakarta, said in a statement.
“The tsunami did not come alone, but took cars, paychecks and homes with it, wiping everything from the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at an open sea speed of 800 km per hour before reaching shore.
Some people climbed to the top of the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to the Palu 24 centres.
Air photos of the disaster showed destroyed buildings and ditches, broken and collapsed bridges, and mosques surrounded by water.
Subsequent incidents in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
With a population of 2.4 million, the area was well aware of the earthquakes.
Indonesia’s Bureau of Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) said in its statement that the energy released after Friday’s powerful earthquake was nearly 200 times greater than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, located near a long and narrow bay, could increase the strength of the tsunami, BPPT said.
Nugroho described the damage as “surprising” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels have collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found beneath the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher in the coastal area 300 km north of the request, called Donggala, which was closer to the earthquake in the summer.
The reports from Donggala “are completely incomplete and contain no information,” Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 residents in the region,” Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are in the direction of the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy that could get even worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report a tsunami in the town of Palu, although authorities said the waves reached the beach at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur cartoons circulating on social media have seen a man on the top floor of a building warning panicked people moving down the street from an approaching tsunami.
Minutes later, the water wall reaches the beach, bringing with it houses and cars.
The Reuters did not immediately confirm the accuracy of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power outage, which impeded communications in the Palu region and made it difficult for authorities to organise rescue operations.
The military has begun sending transport planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other basic work.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue work, with the rest remaining closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
That's very bad.
While World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where they were sheltered in gift boxes set up in their office hall, they saw sparkling sights on their way, said Mr. Doseb.
“They said you saw a lot of lost houses,” he said.
That's very bad.
While the Auxiliary Forces began to take strong action to alleviate the disaster, part of it was that, with extensive experience, foreign aid workers were prevented from travelling to Palus.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, supplies and relief forces can only be sent abroad if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a press spokesman for Indonesia’s Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘OK, it’s a national disaster,’ we can start accepting international aid, but that status has not yet been declared.”
When the second night of Palus arrived after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, people’s friends and families were still full of hope that their loved ones will be the wonderful cases that will ease the birth of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was lifted from the sewerage.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble next to her mother’s body for two days.
Indonesia's national volleyball team coach Gendon Subandano trained two missing volleyball players for the Asian Games, which took place in Indonesia earlier this month.
The rest, who are trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, are his students, added Mr Mandagi.
“As a senior paramedic, I have a personal burden,” he said.
Gendon talked about how, after spreading the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the contestants who were at the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one grey bird instead of two blue birds.
“I think that means the messages didn’t get there,” he said.
The thieves took <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,585.88 during the execution of the ATM in Newport on the Levees
On Friday morning, thieves stole 23 585.88 euros from Brink’s employee at the Levees ATM, Newport police said in a statement.
The driver canceled the ATM at the entertainment facility and was preparing to bring in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
When the man acted, "the other man ran behind Brink's employee" and stole the bag meant to be delivered, which was full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, the press release says, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the stolen persons will be asked to contact the Newport Police Department by phone (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper takes his new name Ye
Rapper Kanye West turns his name into Ye.
On Saturday, the man tweeted, “Andine Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and the man also used the name as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change takes place before his debut by sending Saturday Night Live, where the man is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her concert “through the hours of feeling”, said the author.
In addition to the fact that it is a short description of the man’s current appearance, West has previously said that it is a word of religious importance to him.
"I think 'ye' is one of the most commonly used words in the Bible, which means 'you'," West said earlier, discussing his album with radio director Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us, it’s us.
I changed my name from Kanye, meaning "that one", to Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion and everything else.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye West is not the only rapper to play with his name.
Sean Combs is known primarily as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who had previously collaborated with West, has also used his name with and without a dash of thought, big and small stars.
Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
As the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody attacks on students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised in Tlatelolco Plaza on Sunday that "the Mexicans will never use the military to direct them."
The military attacked a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people while all over Latin America were being carried to confirm leftist student movements.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by paying students monthly grants and opening more free of charge to public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal wealth.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
“As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount allocated to research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and artificial intelligence worker who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after different parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. does not have an official artificial intelligence strategy at all.
At the same time, last year, China introduced its plan to be the maker of artificial intelligence renewal by 2030.
“The doubling of the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are acting on the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
The double funding would double the likelihood that the next major achievement in artificial intelligence will be achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence companies Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that won America's best Othello player. He was later a man on the board of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged the previous U.S. government’s technology competition as a robotics competition (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge) by the U.S. Department of Defense, and asked when the next competition would be held to help identify future dreamers.
“U.S. scientists need to work hard to get funding from the government,” Lee said.
“China is not the one that takes over educators, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired brilliant scientists from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. support artificial intelligence efforts.
“I think that people who have received a doctorate in artificial intelligence should automatically be offered a green card,” the man said.
The Chinese Council of State published the next generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
“China’s National Science Fund shares funding for people working in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Fund and other government agencies allocate money to U.S. scientists, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to involve partners from both industry and educational institutions, but the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced that it started funding the $2 million AI Next initiative.
But the National Research Fund is currently funding over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence-related research.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation was not amended with the aim of creating a national artificial intelligence security committee.
Macedonian voters vote to change the state in a referendum
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia. This would be a step that would also resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern branch is a requirement for this territory and has banned Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries agreed in June on a new name for Macedonia, but opponents of the nationalists argue that the name would harm the national identity of the Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he did not intend to participate in the referendum and the campaign has raised doubts as to whether the electoral activity will achieve the 50% participation rate necessary for the referendum to take place.
The referendum asks: “Do you support Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU, agreeing to the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the amendment, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is the price to pay for Macedonia, which is one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to ensure its accession to organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, who voted for Skopje.
While the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they will follow the outcome of the vote in order to make it decisive.
Two-thirds of Parliament's votes are needed for the amendment.
The National Electoral Commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 13:00.
However, voter turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted for Macedonia in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko gave their vote on September 30, 2018, in a Macedonian referendum on changing the name of the country, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage, raising a chair in front of the tents for those who reject the referendum.
“We want to belong to NATO and the EU, but we want to join the head up, not through the door of the servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as a Macedonian, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and get European-Asia integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more than 20 percent of the necessary investment into Macedonia at the rate of unemployment.
“I believe that the vast majority support the name change, as more than 80 percent of citizens support membership of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after his vote.
He said that a "yes-word" would be a "confirmation of our future".
The results of the poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies on Monday revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters who are under the necessary electoral activity intend to take part in the referendum.
A Macedonian Telma TV poll revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would say yes.
The success rate of the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the government’s Western policy after the government took over the leadership in May last year.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through all of Brighton's defence on behalf of the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defence, securing Manchester City 2–0 victory at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the impression that his 65th-minute goal came in ridiculously easy.
In Argentina, the attacker went through the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He broke through three Brighton defenders before reaching the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke through another defender before running past several players at the Brighton penalty area border.
Then he hit the ball on the left, where Sterling was.
The English striker used the first stroke to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right leg to hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a net strike on the right side.
“Aguerol has problems with his feet,” Manchester City Mayor Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have him at the time.”
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League draw.
He was shot in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball clearly in this game in Brighton territory.
He sent the ball beautifully from the air to Leroy Sane, on the left.
Sane was able to hit the ball a few times before leading Sterling further.
Sky Blues created the ball onto the net just before it slipped out of the boundaries.
Manchester City will play in the Champions League sub-group with Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 am at the Rhine–Neckari Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a cheerleader against Rockies
When the Nationals stayed away from the final tournament games, there was no big reason for the new start.
Scherzer, however, hopes to make it to the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, who lead the Los Angeles Dodgers in one game at NL West, still have hope of reaching the final.
The Rockies secured at least a 5–2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but the team still wants to secure their first division position.
“While we’re not playing for anything, we can at least try knowing that playing in this audience and with another team in the Denver atmosphere is probably at a higher level than any other game I can expect this year.
Why don’t I want to compete here?”
The Nationals have not named the opener since Sunday, but are reportedly leaning towards Scherzer's food in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th feeding, made a warm-up on Thursday and would eat normally on Sunday.
This Washington right-handed player leads 18–7, his ERA is 2.53, the number of outs is 300, and the chances of his 220 2/3 this season.
Trump calls for stimulus speech in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court, while speaking about the importance of the republic's electoral activity in the interim elections.
“Everything we’ve done is going to be in November.
Five weeks before our lifetime, one of the most important elections.
It’s a big event where I’m not a candidate, but I’m actually a candidate, so I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see it as a terrible, extremely terrible extreme group of Democrats, and you see it happening in front of your own eyes.
And they have decided to take back power using any means. You see their cruelty and dirty game.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive over in the name of power and control. All they want is power and control over, and we don’t give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “stand up and prevent.”
“And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil, ugly, submissive, and false.”
He referred, in name, to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was called off from the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak that document?
So, uh, what?
No, no, wait — it was one of the worst examples of body language, actually the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a large party.
It is unacceptable for those who express their opinion.
When the activists of my local party Momentum voted to understand my sentence, it was not surprising.
After all, I am the last of the campers on the list of MPs who are told that you are not welcome, and that's all for expressing my opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, took part in the same treatment because he stood up strongly for anti-Semitism.
For me, the judges judged me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the issues of responsible economic policy, national security and European affairs, there are a number of very similar issues on which Jeremy also had disagreements with the previous leaders.
In a statement, the Nottingham East Labour Party said: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and creative.”
For the most part, my eight-year-long experience as a member of the House of Representatives with the Friday evening general assembly is exactly the same.
Unfortunately, as of today, this is no longer the case for most meetings, and the promise to be “better and gentler” in politics has long been forgotten, if ever it was remembered.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that different viewpoints are not acceptable in the Labour Party and for each opinion it is assessed who is acceptable to the Party’s Board of Directors.
It started right after Jeremy became the leader. The co-worker with whom I thought I would share similar political views in the past, now waited for me to change my mind and take a position that I would otherwise never have agreed to, regardless of whether it was a market or a public state.
Whenever I step up in public, no matter what I’m actually talking about, there’s a sense of condemnation on social media, encouraging my resignation, denying the party’s policy and saying that I shouldn’t belong to the Labour Party.
It’s not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my co-workers, because the comments I make are mostly political.
I admire the competence and decision-making power of those co-workers who face sexist or racist abuse on a daily basis, but never swear an oath.
One of the most disappointing positions in this policy area is how levels of abuse have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is, however, that we are no longer such a large community and any change in the initiative or the rules of the elections will make the party narrower.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head on the ground, talk less, and “it would be all right.”
But that’s not what I came to do in politics.
From the moment I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, motivated by the carelessness of the Thatcher government, which had left the word of my large school classroom in the direct sense of the collapse, I have tried to speak to the better of the public services for the sake of those who need it.
I've never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
There is no way anyone in Nottingham East could have been confused about my political views or the areas of non-conformity with the local leadership.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the state is moving towards Brexit, which is damaging to households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy being loyal to the leader of the Leiborist Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not intended for the Nottingham Moment, but for my supporters, whether they belong to the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not a single threat of withdrawal or political thought will stop me from doing this.

Ayr 38–17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr moves to the top
Two late events may have somewhat delayed the end result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves a win in this wonderfully fun first-class game of Tennent.
They are now the only unbeaten team in the front of the table.
Finally, it was the team’s high level of protection and better risk-taking that led to the home team’s victory and coach Peter Murchiel has the full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been put to the test all the time during the games and we’re still unbeaten, so of course I’m happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie Melrose said, “I like the story of Ayr, they used their options better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr an advantage, but to the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who gave up the game to the Warriors, the yellow card gave Melros the opportunity where Jason Baggot made a failed try.
Climo increased Ayr's fortunes with a penalty kick just before the end of the half-time, reaching a position of 17–5 in favor of Ayr by the end of the single-season.
But Melrose started the second half successfully and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which took over Baggot, reduced the gap by five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, after which the man was taken away in a stretcher. Continuing the game, Ayr further increased the forwards thanks to the look of Stafford McDowall, transmitted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson was then a yellow card, but again paid for the failed attempt by Melrose player Bruce Colvine after a strong push for a failed transmission.
However, the home field team regained strength, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for blocking Climo without a ball on the penalty line, MacPherson put the ball behind the advancing Ayrides.
Climo passed the ball, as he did almost immediately after continuing the game, when Kyle Rowe tried David Armstrong's boxing punch and sent side guard Gregor Henry away on the home field team's fifth try.
Still Game star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems ready to enter the hospitality industry after it was discovered that the man was named the director of a recognized restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC television series he writes and plays alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final in the series and it seems that Kiernan is making new plans for life after Craiglangi.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but Scottish Suni's source hinted that Kiernan wants to join Glasgow's "running restaurant".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia’s maritime district hopes the court will once again open the way for them to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol the headquarters of the Navy in La Paz.
There are ocean blue flags on top of the office buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the naval bases are greeted with a slogan: “The sea is our right.
It is our duty to restore it.”
In Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody resource conflict of the 19th century is still alive. The same vivid is the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations are among the highest in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has a spirit of strength, unity and calmness and the country is naturally looking forward to a shared outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
A bunch of Bolivians across the country are watching the decision of an international court from large screens, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia, after which Chile, after decades of intermittent discussions, is obliged to hold negotiations with Bolivia to the sea to bring the father to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic real-world president, Evo Morales, who is expected to face a controversial re-election battle next year, is weighing heavily on Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, think that the court is unlikely to vote in favor of Bolivia, or if so, it would change very little.
The United Nations Office in the Netherlands does not have the power to give up the territory of Chile and it has provided that it does not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is to be taken only six months after the hearing of the final statements indicates that it was not a “serious case,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, an expert on international law in Chile.
And further away from Bolivia’s additional causes, the last four years may have worsened the situation.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian authorities,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’s wary nobility has lost all the remaining goodwill of Chile, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to discuss everything.
The two countries have not exchanged their envoys since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, who is the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was unnecessarily urgent.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given "an opportunity to start a new era in the country's relations with Chile" and "to end the 139-year differences in mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s best-known presidents, is using the issue of the sea to express political stigma.
“Bolivia never gives up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says it won’t release nuclear weapons until it can’t trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never give up nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to review the promises made to each other by the heads of state at the Singapore summit.
He comments at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo almost seems to be resuming the shutdown of nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
According to Ri, these are airstrikes, believing that the continued US restrictions and the refusal to declare an end to the war with Korea will force North Korea to surrender.
Washington will take a careful approach to such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards arming itself.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang intends to seriously abandon the armaments the country sees as probably the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree on a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion forces bring a series of massive headlines to the viewer, which are brought to buyers on shopping streets in their neighborhood
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t have to search anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought to the stage a series of bizarre super-sized headwear that eclipsed Paris Fashion Week as part of their 2019 summer season.
High and impractical hats are fashion through Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their footwear creations to fashion stores.
Valentino's top work was the model's head covering the overlaid beige hat, which was embellished with closures reminiscent of a wide edge.
Other great items of clothing included jewelry-built scarves, magic cubes and even pineapple, but their purpose is not to warm up.
Thom Browne also showed a strange selection of masks, doing it just at the right time before Halloween.
A large part of the colored masks had concocted mouths, so they reminded more of Hannibal Lecter than of the high fashion.
One part of the work was reminiscent of a diving costume with an air pipe and glasses, while the other was reminiscent of a melted ice cream suit.
And if you're going to continue with the giant swamp swamps, you're in luck.
Moegurus predict that oversized head coverings may also reach the shopping streets near you.
Oversized hats come right on the La Bomba shelf, a 60-centimeter-wide shoulder hat seen in the head of all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which created a largely impractical hat on social media, sent Moelava another large piece of work – a shouldered beach bag that is almost as big as a model with bikinis that carry it.
The dark orange raffiakot, with raffias nails and white leather, was the highlight of the summer collection of Jacquemuse La Riviera 2019 during the Paris Fashion Week.
Famed designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags next summer. Since the designer has had such a big impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra-large items of clothing.”
John Edward: Language skills are important to the world’s citizens
The private schools in Scotland have remained at the forefront of the academic top-level rankings and it also continued in 2018 with the following outstanding examinations, which are reinforced by personal and joint success in sports, arts, music and other community enterprises.
These schools, where more than 30,000 students are studying across Scotland, and represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), seek to provide their students and their parents with the best service.
The aim of the private schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As the education sector, which is able to design and implement a curriculum adapted to the circumstances, we see that modern languages in schools are still known and desired subjects.
Nelson Mandela said, “When you talk to a person in a language that is understandable to him, it comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it will come to his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can only rely on the English language if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we see that the front of the tables are languages with the highest rate of passing of exams among private schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied a foreign language received a high score of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students received the A-value in Mandarin, 72 percent received the same award from German learners, 69 percent from French learners, and 63 percent from Spanish learners.
This shows that Scottish private schools support a foreign language as a vital skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
The languages that are now among the options for study subjects are the same in the curricula of private schools and other schools as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) revealed that, among the reasons why employers find it difficult to find employees for free jobs, 17% of respondents reported a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly compulsory in order to prepare young people for their future work.
As much as more promising job offers require language skills, such skills are becoming essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career choice made, acquiring a second language gives a real advantage to a person in the future, as language skills are viable.
Communicating directly with citizens of foreign countries gives multilinguals an immediate competitive advantage.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent of respondents do not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation about it. The only language whose percentage of learners was bilingual was French 15.
Therefore, the financing of language learning is important for today’s children.
Several languages, especially those of developing economies, provide better opportunities for children to find a good job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
The Hulk School focuses rather on classical modern languages, while other schools are taught a language that is considered to be the most important in the UK in terms of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of the child, private schools always have the opportunity to choose between several languages taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future brings them.
It can no longer be denied that, in a global business environment, languages are of paramount importance for the future of the country, which is why it must also be reflected in education.
It is precisely modern languages that should truly be regarded as ‘international communication skills’.
Private schools continue to provide young Scots with a choice, diversity and insight.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron makes its Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
Instinct admirers no longer have to wait to see LeBron James make his debut in Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, his number of minutes of play still needs to be determined.
“It’s over one and under 48,” said the Walton Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell argued that James is likely to play a number of minutes.
After training last week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need my career at this stage of pre-season games to warm up,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia election campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign series tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump’s first campaign event planned for next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote stands until Trump elects to be appointed to the Supreme Court, he is trying to increase support for future midterm elections as Republicans threaten to lose control in Congress after a vote in November.
What time is Trump’s campaign event in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
The Trump campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday evening, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. on the east coast.
The Trump-Virginia campaign event can be viewed online via YouTube streaming.
Trump is likely to speak to Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh about this week's hearings, which have become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, while a week's Senate confirmation vote has been suspended until the FBI investigates the matter.
However, the main objective of the campaign series is to help a new movement to gather Republicans who face difficult elections in November.
Thus, the Trump campaign leader said that the aim of these five events next week is to "promote volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority that belong to them in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reported.
“Congress checking is so important to the president’s agenda that Trump drives as many states as possible as he dives into the fast election campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to mention his name told Reuters.
This evening's campaign event, which is planned to take place at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and also get coverage in the Pittsburgh media," West Virginia Metro News reported.
Saturday marks the second time that Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, a state where he received more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senator Patrick Morriseyd, a Republican from West Virginia, who is running the polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has come to encourage his results,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team splits nervously to compete, keeping hopes high ahead of Sunday's singles games
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon’s games were among the games that the Ryder Cup needed.
The all-round turning point pendulum has a completely invented concept in sports, but players believe in it really, especially in competitions like this one here.
So, where do they think the turning point is now?
“They led with six points, four of which have now become four, so I think I can consider it a small turning point,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, this is clear because it is guided by four points and there are 12 points left in the game.
According to Spieth, Americans feel that they don’t have enough wind to sail, but they have a lot of courage, especially in the face of Spieth and Justin Thomase, who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has been a walking stick for both the tie and the green and shows an example.
These winning streaks from the chest became more and more intense with each round, hiding the deciding bat that would have led to a fourth-place draw after he and Thomas were on the ground with the two of them.
His bat that won the match on the 15th sent a similar shout, which showed the man's belief that the Americans are not out of the competition yet.
“You just have to play more focused and worry about your match,” Spieth said.
This is the only thing players can do.
18 holes to keep track.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed stars of the Ryder Cup at Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's strange but beloved couple are four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding the bogeys on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon, and on their backs at 1 a.m.
This game and the way their energy flows into both the noisy crowd and back, reinforces the opinion that the players they compete with on Sundays, and that when the sun rises over Le Golf National, there is no possible European player known to confirm victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, the beauty of Europe is predictable.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did Sergio Garcia, this morning with a four-ball hero, a quick job when the man put together a pair of Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles in the first nine dug the Spanish and the Swedes into a hole so deep that they had no hope of digging themselves out of it.
There's no one to help you out on Saturday.
The four-ball and pairing games are extremely compelling to look closely at just the communication between the pairs, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t get, and how the way can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken the lead for the last day with a strong lead, but this four-man session showed that the U.S. team is divided into a battle of nerves, in which some, especially Americans, have doubted.
Europe to lead the Ryder Cup on the last day 10–6
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will be in a good position to lead 10–6 against the United States after Saturday’s four-ball and pairing games.
The great duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the struggling Tiger Woods in two wins to raise their current score at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who contributed to the preservation of the lost deck in Hazeltine two years ago, ruled the American side in four balls in the morning, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the pairing game, winning two games, but they were unable to replace the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to keep the deck.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row. Together with Molina, who after this hectic weekend is called Molliwood, they are the second pair to have won four points in Ryder Cup history in their fourth open game.
After destroying four goals for Woods and Patrick Reed, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeauveregg more firmly: 5-4.
Woods, who pulled through two games on Saturday, showed a casual glow, but has now lost his 29 four-ball and 19 pairing games, earning seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested for four in the morning, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in a pairing, winning 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked first and third in the world rankings.
In Europe it did not succeed, although the competition was considered pleasant and windy with the weather south of Paris.
Three-time Grand Prix winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a 4–0 victory over Spain's Jon Rahmi and Ian Poulter, coming back later and winning the pairings of Poulter and Rory McIlroyd 4–3, having lost two openings.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has come back from a four-point deficit, going into individual games, although as the owner, Furyk only needs half a deck to keep the deck.
While two days of better second place, it seems after Sunday's counterattack that they will not succeed.
North Korea says they don’t make themselves “in no way” armed unilaterally because of a lack of trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the continued restrictions deepened their distrust of the United States and that the country does not intend to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual meeting of the World Organization that North Korea has taken “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see the United States responding to that,” he said.
“Without the U.S., there is no security in our country, and under such circumstances, we do not in any way agree to unilaterally arm ourselves first.”
While Ri repeated well-known complaints about Washington's "sudden" approach to nuclear disarmament, under which North Korea will be rewarded if it steps in step with action, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject the creation unilaterally.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump for the first time on June 12 at a summit between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore, when Kim promised to move “to abandon the Korean peninsula’s nuclear deterrence” and Trump promised North Korea a security guarantee.
North Korea has wanted to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also been opposed to calls for the relaxation of the strict international restrictions on North Korea.
“The United States is calling for ‘primarily nuclear renunciation’ and is increasing the pressure of restrictions to achieve their goal coercively, even in opposition to the declaration of an end to the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that limitations push us on our knees is a dream for people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that the continued restrictions are deepening our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plan for Kim and Trump’s second summit, which the U.S. leader stressed earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the meeting between three Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the issue of nuclear disarmament were one of the parties to the issue of nuclear disarmament, South Korea, not the United States, would not have brought the issue of nuclear disarmament to the fore.”
However, Ri’s remarks differed sharply from last year’s when he told the U.N. General Assembly that turning to the U.S. mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile master” on the suicide mission.
Last year, North Korea fully approved the destruction of the U.N.-threatened Trump in Kim’s sky for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but added that there is still much to be done and that the restrictions must remain in place until North Korea’s nuclear weapons cease-fires.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn’t have a schedule for it, saying, “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should pay tribute to Pyongyang’s actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the enforcement of the Security Council’s restrictions must continue vigorously and unabated until we can fully and definitively confirm the nuclear withdrawal.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions applicable to North Korea in an effort to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met next to the UN General Assembly in Riga and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
After a July meeting with Pyongyang, he said progress had been made, after which North Korea condemned him for “gangster-like demands” in just a few hours.
This month, North Korea promised to dismantle the missiles and the nuclear complex if the U.S. were to take “appropriate action.”
He said that Kim had told him that under “responsible measures” it meant the security guarantees allowed in Trump’s Singapore and the move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students will learn how to get enough rest.
This year, Harvard University offers a new course where students need to sleep more to battle a growing aggressive culture where they learn in high-caffeine-rich, night-long study marathons.
Students who love the academicity of the world’s best universities are often helped when it comes to the fundamentals of self-care.
According to this course’s designer, Harvard Medical School’s Sleep Doctor and Brigham and Professor Charles Czeisler, it is the first private hospital in the United States.
He encouraged the creation of the course after he held a talk on how sleep disorders affect learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I talking about this now, in my last school year?’
He said that no one had ever told him the importance of sleep - it made me a pope," he told the Telegraph.
The course, which came for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting outcomes and also help improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of health at the university, said the university decided to take a course plan after it was found that students were in serious sleep during the working week.
The hour-long course involves a number of interrelated tasks.
In one section, students will be able to click on coffee cups, cardinals, sports clubs and books, and they will be explained about the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects sports outcomes and the importance of the practice that has developed during sleep.
The second part explains to participants how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The campus map, along with interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily habits that have been shaped.
“We know that this does not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the impact of smoking cigarettes on health," Professor Czeisler added.
He said he is still proud of the night learning marathons, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure for students means that sleep deprivation is still a growing problem.
“Ensuring sufficient quality sleep should be a student’s ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety,” he added. “It even helps against weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of hunger, making people constantly hungry.”
A 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, Raymond So, helped Professor Czeisler create a course by taking part in one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to contribute to the creation of a university course.
As a next step, he wants all undergraduate students to undergo a similar curriculum before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set a wake-up call for both going to bed and waking up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of electronic screens and LED lighting on the “blue light” because it can damage the rhythm of their day and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: My goal was scored by Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another poor guest game result when Dolly Menga, sent by Steven Gerrard, brought a 1-0 win to Livingston.
Ibrox's side hoped to win their first home win since February, when 4-1 St Johnstone was defeated, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as the lead, remaining eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership's lead Hearts.
I knocked on my door seven minutes before halftime and Rangers' poor preparation for it failed to recover.
The Rangers therefore fall to sixth place, Livingston rising to third, leaving Hibernian with only one goal.
For Rangers, the problems may not yet be over, as their attacker Calum Spence needed a primary treatment after he was hit with a possibly rescinded object.
Gerrard made eight changes on the side, leading past Ayrist and Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, however, went on with the same Liv 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been pleased with how his well-trained boys warm up their opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers could have been more dominant, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have knocked the gate on the second open minute when Menga's first exchange sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's gate, but the midfielder didn't take his chances.
A deep Keaghan Jacobs free kick was then found by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was able to make only a wide-angle kick in the back of the post.
The Rangers did gain control, but they seemed to have more hope than belief in their last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos felt confident that he should have received a penalty kick if he collided with Steven Lawless in the 15th minute of the game, Judge Steven Thomson did not satisfy the Columbia player's complaint.
Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried about either the Lassana Coulibaly or Ovie Ejaria.
Although Liv's 34th minute opening stroke may have broken the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely for their performances.
Again, the Rangers were unable to direct Jacobs' deep-heavy performance.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the peace and selected Mena, who simply finished the plan.
Gerrard acted during the break, swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. This swap almost paid off when the extreme player broke Morelos, but the impressive Kelly fed to block his place.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to play exactly the type of game that suits those where Lithgow and Halkett picked up a long ball.
Holt's side could have promoted his leadership on the final stage, but McGregor stood firm, preventing Jacobs before Lithgow struck a corner with a large arch.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton again applied for a penalty kick when he went to school with Jacob, which Thomson again did not satisfy.
Almanahh: Inventor of the Geiger List
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanah: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and LENDADES... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. It was an invention that eventually led to a device known as a Geiger counter.
From the very beginning of this science, Geiger's list also became a pop culture base, as in the 1950 film Coronado's Clocks, where, in the main, these were seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What else is this?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When wearing these earplugs, it is possible to hear the sound of atoms separated from the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: “Don’t say it, it’s still growing!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention of his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to ‘See’ Pettur Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to ‘See’ Pettur Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to Know a Fraudulent Cell as Part of Treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing their cells in the laboratory
Then they are able to "see" a common protein for many cancers and they are injected back
The vaccine of the study shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
One woman who was treated for the immune system with a vaccine to teach the detection of fraudster cells, her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves the removal of immune cells from the patient. These cells are changed in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein that is common to various HER2 cancers, and then these cells are injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, explained: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “leads the growth of many types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where patients are taken from immune cells and are taught to target cancer cells, has been used in the treatment of certain types of leukemia.

You will receive a Saturday Night Live studio tribute to Kanye West’s humiliating villain, following a mixed speech in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced his candidacy for the same post in 2020.
After that night's third song, which bore the name Ghost Town and where he wore a hat with the letter Make America Great, he began to perform against the smaller Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked to so many white people who ask me, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I were so worried about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago,” he said.
The SNL began a show with Matt Damon, where Hollywood fame made a joke about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's alleged sexual violence.
While this part of the show didn't go into the ether, West's soundscapes were uploaded to Chris Rock's social media.
It's unclear if Rock tried to look at West's post.
West also complained to the audience that he was behind the scenes with regard to his hat quite heavy.
“They’re dragging me behind the scenes.
They said I wouldn't go there, hat in the head.
They lied to me!
And then they say I'm drowning in a place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see where I’m drowning? I’m putting on my Superman’s hat because it means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love.”
His comments sparked the audience’s outrage at least twice and it seemed that the SNL team was embarrassed. According to Variety, one person stated: “The whole studio was dead.”
West was sent to replace Ariana Grande at the last minute, as the singer's ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with the song "I Love It", which he looked like Perrier's bottle at the time of his performance.
West received the support of the conservative group TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who voiced: “To one brave soul: THANK YOU, THAT JULYSIDS WANT THE RESPONSIBILITY.”
But sender Karen Hunter argued that West was simply “who she is, and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I decided to reward MITTE (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’) someone who I think believes and spreads a harmful worldview to my community.
He's free.
“Just like us,” he added.
The rapper announced on Twitter that he has changed his name, saying he is now "former Kanye West."
He is not the first singer to change his stage name, following Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg has been nicknamed Snoop Lion and, of course, the recently released music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol.
The murder charge of stabbing a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with murder after a second man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The prosecution will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The fame of the game of Thrones Kit Harington does not approve of the soft masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-shining role as Jon Snowin on HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor (31) dismisses an aggressive hero stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young guys often feel that they have to be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that “something went wrong” and raised the question of how to solve the problem of soft masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a co-star of her game of Thrones, (31), acknowledged that she feels “very strongly” that this problem needs attention.
“I personally feel pretty strongly now that we’ve gone somewhere wrong with masculinity,” he said.
“What have we taught men as they grow up, because of the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that the rise in soft masculinity is partly to blame for television, as it shows superhuman characters.
He continued: “What has been born and what is being taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they have to be exactly what they want to be men.
I think that’s really one of the biggest questions of our time – how to change it?
Obviously, something went wrong for the young people.”
He also admitted that after the end of the series the following summer he would never participate in any of the Thrones games, saying he was "on one side with his own battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit Sam Shepard participates in the revival of True West, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his kidnapped brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers a meeting with his wife Rose the best thing about the game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played Emmy in the award-winning fantasy series Ygritte, beloved by Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% growth in new cases
China has reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to health care workers, more than 820,000 people suffer from this disease.
In the second quarter of 2018, alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have emerged from sex, thus making the past.
HIV was spread in some parts of China through blood transfusions .
But in this way, the number of people infected with HIV had decreased to almost zero, Chinese health officials confirmed at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is allegedly high.
Due to the country’s older values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of the disease are related to the insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has allowed general access to HIV medicines to be used to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking GOP senator’s data, saying it was “dangerous lies” and “water claims.”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that her employee had posted personal information from three Republican U.S. Senators on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are spread by “ultra-right” trolls and their websites.
"You're wrong, you're wrong and you're even more pathetic," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information allegedly contained addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both from Utah).
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Former websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to the Waters office and released the membership information of the employee under Waters, Hill said.
“This unfounded claim is a complete and absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“My employees whose personal data, personal data and safety are at risk because of their fraudulent and false claims are in no way responsible for this information.
This unfounded claim is a complete and irrefutable lie.”
Waters’ statement was quickly evaluated online, including one of the commentators, former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial stems from anger,” wrote Fleischer.
“This indicates that he has a sense that is not appropriate for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not become angry.
They can't be competitive.
They must not cast doubt on the motives of the accused.
You have to stay calm.”
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters’ reaction to criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It’s important when it’s true,” he said.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned “the relevant authorities of the law and order in connection with these fraudulent claims.”
“We will do all we can to find out about the criminals,” he continued, “and to make them legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all of my employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Understocked Rowan Atkinson Spy Parody
It is now customary to look for the meaning of Brexit in all new British films and it seems to be particularly appropriate in the parody of Johnny English's wet comedy series - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was followed up in 2011 with the revival of Johnny English Reborn.
Is it humorous to joke about how obviously stupid we are at the country’s new export opportunity?
In any case, Johnny English, an incompetent Johnny English, has been allowed to do things again in his own hectic way - and that this wide-ranging comic creation is meant for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, this is a secret agent, who, despite his strangely pretentious glamorous smut, is somewhat reminiscent of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean, and a bit of a character who gave the tone to the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also based on the character of the passenger and the international secret Atkinson, once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, which leaves behind only chaos.
In this last JE movie, there are only one or two pleasant moments.
I liked the approach to Johnny English's helicopter when he was wearing a medieval iron rod, and for a while the tightness of the chopper he leaned against the helmet.
Atkinson’s donation to make a physical comedy is shown, but humor seems less important and strangely exaggerated, especially as “serious” spy films such as 007 and Mission Impossible also provide themselves with self-confident comedy.
It seems that this humor is more intended for children than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s plans are not as vague and focused as Atkinson’s dark films, Beana.
At present, there is an eternally current assumption that the UK is in serious trouble.
K<0xC3><0xBC>berh<0xC3><0xA4>kker has infiltrated the UK’s top-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all the UK’s top secret police officers, thus preparing a major disappointment for the local agent – a regrettable small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, who is a festive and troublesome character who suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does this Teresa-May character perfectly, but there is not much in the manual to work on.
His mentors suggest that since all active spies are at risk, he must call back someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster in a proud institution, giving a secret lesson on how to be a secret agent: here are a few good places where English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English is flown back to Whitehall for emergency information and she reunites with her former longtime husband Bough, who is played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the captain of the submarine, where the talents of actress Vicki Pepperdine have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, the disgraces of his Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, meeting Olga Kur<0xC3><0xB5>lenko, a beautiful woman who was framed by Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the prime minister falls dangerously under the hands of a charismatic tech billionaire. Too claims to be able to solve all the computer problems in Britain: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start off with their frantic ride: hiding themselves as presenters, they set fire to the French restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking into the Volta luxury yacht on board; and English launches a real mess when he tries to use the virtual reality headset to explore the inside of the Volta house.
In this last section, no brakes are used, but as cute and stormy as it is, there is a children's TV mug on the side.
It's a pretty average stuff.
And as with other Johnny English films, I came to my mind: Is there really no role for Rowan Atkinson in the British film industry that would be fair to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to draw up a plan where the British work four days a week, but they are paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party has weighed in on a hefty plan that predicts that the British will work four days a week, but they will be paid for five days.
The party wants the company’s superiors to pass on the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to the saved workers, giving them one more day off.
So the workers would have a three-day weekend - but they would get the same pay.
According to the source, this idea would fit the party's economic agenda and thus the state intends to tilt it to the benefit of the workers.
Thursday’s working week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress to allow workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A Labour source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that the revision of the draft will be announced before the end of the year.
“It’s not going to happen overnight, but Thursday’s week of work is an effort that matches the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of both the workers and the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a Thursday working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the effort is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "The party's policy is not discussed on Thursday's working week."
Assignee John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to clarify his view of the socialist turnaround in the economy.
McDonnell said he has decided to take back power from “unexpected leaders” and “profit-makers” of municipal enterprises.
Assignment plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not be able to recover all of their shares, as the Labour Party could make “debts” in relation to perceived falsification.
He confirmed his plan to put employees on company boards and create inclusive equity funds to give 10% of the equity of private sector companies to employees, instead of giving annual bonuses of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>561.65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds
The investigation of the charges brought by the FBI against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote in the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the Bureau’s findings could affect the termination of Republican support for senators.
In a Sunday poll, you might ask Republican Republican co-chairman Scott Pelley, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could reveal anything that could change those minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said I was going to the hearing, and I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were dropped and asked, "Did you do that?"
He was decisive, sure and unambiguous."
Graham's voice seems to be rock-solid.
“I am confident in my decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh, and it could only be changed in a bombshell,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know how it happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all those whom he has named could not confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don’t see anything new coming.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to the reduction of poverty?
This Saturday, the annual New York Global Citizen Festival will host an annual music event with a hugely impressive celebrity participation and the same impressive goal: to eliminate poverty from the world.
Now, for the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park’s Great Lawn area not only enjoying such singers as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the event’s true purpose, which is to reduce extreme poverty to 20 years.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. It is an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by constantly increasing the number of people struggling against it.
To get a free event ticket (if you just don’t want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a variety of tasks or volunteer activities, send an email to a world leader, call or do something else important to help raise the awareness of the internet.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when there are 12 more years left to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way to convince them to take action, or is it just another click-through where people feel they are doing something important by signing a statement online or streaming it?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “activities” of its supporters, seeking to achieve a number of different goals.
According to this, these measures have helped world leaders to report more than $37 billion in commitments and policies, affecting more than 2.25 billion people’s lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and notifications arising from their activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or funded.
The group estimates that the secured funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include a partnership between investors and executives based in the UK, The Power of Nutrition, which is dedicated to “helping children make full use of their abilities” by promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the United Kingdom after receiving more than 4,700 doses of Ciizen.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn undernutrition into a historic landmark of social injustice,” said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman at the London Conference in April 2018.
The group also reported that after more than 5,000 activities calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced a funding project for The Power of Nutrition, which reaches 5 million women and children in need of intervention in the food sector.
In response to one of the CCPs on their website, they asked, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “This is a long and difficult road – sometimes we fall and fail.
But as we face major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we are confident of our success, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are just a couple of performers who perform at this year’s New York event, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Could Use Navy 'trough' to Prevent Russian Energy Exports - Home Secretary
According to the Washington Examiner, if necessary, Washington can use its naval forces to avoid hitting the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke has announced.
Zinke claimed that Russia's participation in Syria, especially if it is acting on the invitation of the legitimate government, is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, at the bottom of Southern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
“The United States has this opportunity, with the help of our Navy, to ensure that the sea lines are open and, if necessary, blocked, to ensure that their energy does not go on the market,” he added.
Zinke’s statement was addressed to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that represents the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic choice between Iran and Russia is more or less, the strengthening and the replacement of fuels,” he said, referring at the same time to Russia as a “one-trick bridge” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These announcements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do so, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to eliminate the “unfit” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “prison” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s sharp opposition to the project is motivated by purely economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at a meeting in Moscow in September with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry.
The U.S. position has received a backlash from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Industrial Union (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and Berlin and Moscow’s bilateral agreements.
“It is a big problem for me if a third country interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Union (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she was seriously considering running for president in the midterm elections.
In Holyoke County, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed his candidacy.
“Women have time to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes the first lead,” he said.
"After November 6th, I seriously consider running for president."
Warren also gave an assessment of President Donald Trump’s actions, saying that it “leads the country in the wrong direction.
“I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been critical of Trump and its Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren said, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most Warren’s own voters do not think he should run for office in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk's Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58 percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters thought the senator should not run.
32% supported such an application.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, 38% supported a possible candidacy, and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with the possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Donald Trump on Track Palin PTSD
Track Palin (26) spent a year recruiting for Iraq in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with the domestic violence case and was charged
“What my son is going through, what he experiences when he comes back, I can relate to other families who know the consequences of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are going through,” he told the audience at Donald Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest of his son "in space" and said about his son and other military veterans that "they come back a little differently, they come back as charades, they come back thinking whether there is enough respect for what the soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have done."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with assaulting a woman in a domestic violence case, interfering in a domestic violence report, and possessing a weapon in a drunken state.
18 states and the region of Columbia contest a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the region of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that bans asylum-seekers who flee from violence or violence.
On Friday, representatives of 18 states and regions in Washington presented a brief statement of court friends to support a challenging policy related to asylum seekers, NBC News reported.
The applicant's full name of Grace v. Sessions' suite, which was opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August, has not been published.
The woman said that her accomplice “and her violent sons of the members of the force” abused her, but U.S. officials did not accept her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Grace’s state-sponsored lawyers described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries that produce a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, among whom there are major problems of armies and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence in order to apply for asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “deals decades of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law requires all asylum applications to be settled in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a requirement violates this principle,” the court friends’ brief statement said.
The lawyers also said in a brief statement that banning immigrants from entering the United States would harm the U.S. economy, saying that they are likely to start as entrepreneurs and “offer the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions told immigration judges in June not to give shelter to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence against the wealth.
“The asylum application is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or a certain social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
The goal of the shelter has never been to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day.
Amusement rescue operations in Palus, where deaths have doubled in the fight against finding survivors
For the rest of the population, the situation was becoming more and more dangerous.
“The situation is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who comforted her infant son in the evacuation center in Palu.
“Every minute there will be new people in a hurry.
“Clean water is not enough.”
The residents returned to their destroyed homes, sorting through things and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which had been damaged by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of Dwi Haris, who was injured, including in the hands of a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients continued to be treated under external conditions due to strong after-effects.
The pirates filled her eyes as she remembered how a powerful earthquake ripped through her fifth-floor hotel room, which she shared with her husband and daughter.
“It took me a while to save myself.
I think I was pushed against the wall by the curtains," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they are not in danger.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Torture of Violent Advertising’
A week after China’s official newspaper published four page advertisements under the U.S. daily newspaper about the daily benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. newspapers to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to an addition paid by the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's largest newspaper - after China was accused of interfering in the U.S. Congress election, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to intervene in the US election marked what U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new stage in Washington’s expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war where import tariffs are adjusted to each other.
China's countermeasures at the start of the tariff war were designed to capture states like Iowa's exporters because they supported Trump's Republican parties, Chinese and US experts have explained.
U.S. Ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, as well as China’s largest exporter of agricultural products Terry Branstad, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday: “China has now doubled its harassment by publishing engagement-advertising in our free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses America’s expensive freedom of speech and free press practice, putting its paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“There is only a limited voice in Beijing’s street kiosk and you don’t really see the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s worrying economic direction, given that the media is firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article, but he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans to extradite female voters ahead of midterm elections in Kavanaugh fiasco
While many Republicans are waiting and defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of multiple sexual assaults, analysts have warned that they will see a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The sentiments surrounding the situation have been in the air and most Republicans have already shown that they want to move forward with the vote.
These things can't be taken back," said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute pursuit of the FBI investigation is enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday—they don’t forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative for the progressive group MoveOn, in a statement.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" in a statement at their Senate corridor because Republicans who control the judges' committees decided to move on with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite Dr Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic said.
"Democratic indignity and internal indignity are going to be out of the picture," Stu Rothenberg, an unofficial political analyst, told reporters.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who don’t like the president and often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which described his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts predicted a backlash as Republicans moved forward with confirmation.
“It has become very confusing for the GOP,” former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the Commission’s vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be put in office, it’s also about how Republicans have dealt with it and how they’ve treated it,” he told a group called Priorities USA, which helps Democrats choose Guy.
However, Americans seem to be a bit divided on who believes Ford after the testimony and who Kavanaughi, but a little more in support of the former.
YouGovi’s new survey showed that 41% of respondents certainly or likely believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they certainly or likely believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they think Kavanaugh has probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other charge against Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford admitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Riigikogu candidate showed him his sexual orientation when they attended a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet that would be connected to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend Inrupt is a company that builds the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have been given access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was “world governance”.
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data collection” or POD.
It may include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music collection, and other personal and competent tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all available in one browser and at the same time.
This personal online data collection makes it unique for the user to be able to choose who gets access to this information.
The company calls it “data-driven for the granting of personal authority”.
According to John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is that the company will bring resources, processes, and relevant skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project under the contract, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google, whether to bring about a complete change if all of their business models are fully supported overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a post published in the media on Saturday that Inrupt’s goal is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website created on the basis of Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Bernard Vann: The spiritual memorial stone of Victoria's Cross was opened in World War I
The only Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I celebrated its 100th anniversary in its hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann fought out his honour on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he died four days later through the sniper's bullet and did not know that he had received the highest British military honors.
His two sons opened a memorial stone in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be “genuinely symbolic” if the stone was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning fight.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through a very thick wave of japs and a hearing aid."
Later, he rushed to the line of attack and carried it on with "the greatest gallantry" before he rushed to one of the audience's singles and made three of his opponents undefeated.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanni killed a German sniper on October 4, 1918, when the war was only a little over a month away.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I will never be able to repeat, but for which I will always be grateful.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann set the stage for the parade, led by the Royal Youth Band of Brentwood.
Michael Vann said he has “a very great honor to participate in this parade,” adding that “so many people’s presence and support show that a true hero can be appreciated.”
MMA fans were up all night watching Bellator 206, but only saw P<0xC3><0xB5>rsas Peppa
Imagine you’ve been up all night to watch the Bellator 206, but this main event doesn’t show you anything.
The San Jose match featured 13 fights, including six from the base cards, and it was shown in the UK on Channel 5 livecast throughout the night.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to stab each other in the chest, the United Kingdom's audience was stunned because Peppa appeared on the screen.
Many weren’t excited about it, especially those who had been awake until the early hours to see this fight.
A fan on Twitter described the transition to children’s comics as “some kind of hurtful joke.”
“It’s a government regulation that at 6.00 a.m. the content was no longer appropriate and they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications when asked about the transfer.
"The Peppa Pig, yes."
Bellator President Scott Coker said they intend to work on preparing their schedule to take more into account the UK viewers in the future.
“When I think about re-introducing now, I think we will be able to solve this problem in the future,” Coker said.
“But when it’s 6am on Sunday morning, we can’t do it until Sunday itself, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of back-and-forth text and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was the government’s rule.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We show six fights instead of a reference - as we usually do - we tried to offer more to the fans and we just went over time.
It’s a tough situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Undervalued’ About Sexuality
Olympic champion diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until high school that “everyone is not like him”.
While attending Lauren Laverne's Radio 4 broadcast Desert Island Discs, she said she was talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
Even becoming a parent changed his attitude to winning the Olympics, giving the feeling that it is no longer so important.
You get the usual long-term messenger Kirsty Young had to take a few months off due to his illness.
In Laverne's first post, Daley said she felt less valued growing up than others because it wasn't socially acceptable when you liked boys and girls.
He said: “Until today, these feelings that I’m not worthy and feel different have given me the power and the strength to be successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was worthy of “something” and didn’t disappoint others when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic champion has become a highly regarded frontrunner of the LGBT campaign, using his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to turn to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he’s talking about it because he’s lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man – the American film artist Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “found him as a surprise.”
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’re so young you’re going through so much” – he went to his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – then it was hard to find someone the same old who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his “all outlook” has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning the gold medal,” he said.
“But you know, there are a lot more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after a brain tumor diagnosis.
Daley said his father refused to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 – because he wanted to sit on the front porch.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you can’t sit in the front row because you’re not there by now,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually stopped breathing and died, did I finally admit that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew it was what I'd dreamed of my whole life - diving in front of the home crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling of it," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Heather Small's Proud - which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still makes him a chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson was eliminated from the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson makes a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he needs to improve his form to avoid an unlucky verse.
Mickelson, who plays a record 12 times every two years at the event, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's pairing and four-ball.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner split his day into two, being a motivator and working on his game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct hitter, not even at the peak of his career, does not fit the 48-year-old especially to play tight Le Golf National golf course, where a long hard track constantly penalizes missed shots.
And if the square itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson will face the exact British Open champion Francesco Molina, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his races this week.
When Americans, who are behind with four points at the start of 12 individual games, start with a fire, Mickelson’s competition can be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in her husband, but had little else to add.
“He fully understood his part today, patted me on the shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk added.
“He is very confident.
He's a celebrity and he's given so much to our teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but it went that way and we had to choose such a path.
He wants to be out, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson passes Nick Faldo’s record on Sunday as the most player to participate in Ryder Cup games.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, but has never met his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence has given the team an additional mental contribution.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he likes to have fun with people, and he's just great in the team room," he explained.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun against him this week and it was nice to see that.
He offers a lot more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great fortune may soon be lost
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his own experience that Ryder Cup’s last day’s great leadership position at the start of individual games can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Danish made a public appearance at the 1997 race in Valderram, where, together with Captain Seve Ballesteros, a five-point advance was held in front of the Americans, but by the time the finish line had reached the finish line, the win was only 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2: 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You even remember that we had a great leadership position in Valderrams; we also had great success in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrams, where we won, this victory came very close,” said Bjorn, who was in the picture after the Class of 2018 win of 5: 3 on Friday and yesterday’s success in 10: 6 at the National Golf.
So history shows me and the whole team that it can be repeated.
You're going to give yourself the best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right things.
It's not over until you have the points in writing.
We have a goal, which is to win the caricature, and so we focus on it.
I’ve always said I’m focused on 12 players who are on our side, but we’re very aware of who are our opponents – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with how his players have played in this tough golf course, Bjorn added: “I’m not going to rush things.
Tomorrow is all about new obstacles.
Tomorrow I’ll be reading my personal essays, so it’s something else.
It’s nice to be with an opponent when things are going well, but if you’re there in person, you’ll be fully tested as a golfer.
This is a message you have to send to the players - give yourself the best of tomorrow.
Now that you leave your partner behind, you have to go and get him to do it yourself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes that his players will perform better in person than with his opponents, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both during these last days, being part of the Brookline winning team, before being part of a loss when Europe succumbed to the "Medinah miracle".
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to the question of how in 1999, Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put all of their game on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start with a fire like in Brookline and like in Medina.
When the lift goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the average competition.
We will set up our team accordingly and put the boys on the pitch in a way that we feel will give birth to a miracle tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the competition and he is best matched with Rory McIlroy, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmi, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other best Europeans in the competition.
“I put my guys in order because I think that’s how we’re properly covered,” Bjorn said of his selection of singles.
Germany's new warship has re-launched
The German Navy’s newest high-speed jet would have been due to come into service in 2014, replacing obsolete Cold War-era warships, but this will not happen until next year due to damaged systems and rising costs as a result of snowballing, the local media reported.
The deployment of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class high-speed cruiser Rheinland-Pfalz has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the military press release published in the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy as early as 2014, but the worrying post-transition problems did not make it easy to achieve this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships, commissioned by the Navy in 2007, replace the obsolete Bremen-class expressboats.
It is understandable that they have a powerful beam, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared, and audible signal reduction.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the latest express trains should be able to be sent out of the port of call for up to two years.
Constant delays, however, mean that high-end warships - which allow Germany to strengthen its power abroad - are already becoming obsolete by the time of service.
The failed F125 jet appeared in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time that the Navy had sent the ship back to the shipowner after receiving it.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited several significant "software and hardware shortages" that made the warship unfit for use if used on a combat mission.
The software shortages were particularly important, as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ship is managed by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the workforce of the older Bremen-class expressboats.
It also revealed that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future innovations.
The 7000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is probably twice as heavy as the same class of ships the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project will also become a problem, including team training.
It is said to amount to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) - compared to the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the new high-speed trains are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings, according to which the German navy's power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Navy had "in fact been able to take out ships".
The official said that this topic has grown as a snowball over time, because the old ships were eliminated, but the replacement ships did not come.
He expressed regret that none of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class express jets could join the navy.
The National Trust investigates the secret of skin cancer
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how skin diseases use the landscape to find their own food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help guide future safeguards.
A study by researchers at the Scottish National Trust is being conducted in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross, Scotland, as well as brown long-eared and daubentton skin.
Special recorders are placed in the main locations of the area to monitor the activity of skin lesions throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers also conduct external research using hand-held sensors.
The competent assessment of all records shall determine the frequency and types of activity of skin rashes.
Then, a map of the habitats and a report is created to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
NTS Nature Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes the results will show which habitats are most important for skin cancers and how different species use them.
This information helps to determine the usefulness of habitat management, such as the creation of wetlands and how best to preserve forests for skin diseases and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, the incidence of skin diseases has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect their habitat and their loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can flying papers and chemical processing of some building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Skin curls aren't really dark.
But because of their night hunting, their ears are more useful in catching the crop than their eyes.
They use sophisticated cascading techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight trajectory.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is taking skin diseases very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, reviews, and sometimes even rescue.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only special skin reserve in the Thrave area of Dumfrie and Galloways, home to eight of Scotland's ten skin species.
Property manager David Thompson says that this area is an ideal territory for them.
“We have a large area in Threave for skin diseases,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a great place to live.
But there’s still a lot to discover about skin cancer, so the work we do here and elsewhere helps us better understand what they need.”
He stresses the importance of controlling skin diseases before starting maintenance activities in real estate, as the unwanted destruction of one place of confinement and childbirth can kill up to 400 mothers and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
Skin diseases are protected and killing, disturbing or destroying them is illegal.
Scottish officer Elisabeth Ferrell has been encouraging the public to help with the project.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our skin cancers and we just don’t know many of our species and how their asuras feed.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges While Lawyers Plan to File a German Journal in Court
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the allegations of rape as "guilty", saying that people "want to advertise themselves" using his name.
Her lawyers are planning to file charges with the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the indictment.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping Kathryn Mayor in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He has allegedly paid 330 643.10 euros to the women's body to avoid the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
In a live video of his 142 million followers after being charged, Ronaldo, 33, was reported to have been involved in “victims.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What we are talking about today is false news," the five-time Ballon d'Ori winner told the news.
They want to advertise themselves by my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by my name, but that's part of the job.
“I’m a happy man and I’m fine,” the player added, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to appeal to the Der Spiegel court in connection with “the making of an unauthorized statement of suspicion regarding privacy”.
Advocate Christian Schertz said the player is seeking compensation “for causing moral damage, which corresponds to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged case was found in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayor allegedly went back to the player's hotel room, where he allegedly was raped, according to documents submitted to the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent a good man", of which "one percent slips down".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed a couple of sexual encounters, but this did not agree.
Mayor also claims that he went to the police and took photos of injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court solution because he feared "due to the fine" and was concerned about "public humiliation".
Now, the 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to reverse the solution, as the alleged case continues to traumatize her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United during the alleged attack and joined Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Italy with a deal of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million worth of giant Juve.
Brexit: UN could begin to regret the departure of automakers forever
The UK would “sadly regret it forever” if it lost its position as world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at a factory near Derby in Burnaston.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
A Japanese automaker said the impact of border crossings without a Brexit deal could pay for jobs.
The Burnastone plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis vehicles, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if the UK starts leaving the EU at the end of March, we will see the production process at our factory stop,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Burnastone Toyota.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have also feared leaving the EU without an agreement, raising concerns about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford after Brexit for one month.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to supply chain risks in the absence of a Brexit agreement.
The Toyota production line operates as needed, where spare parts arrive from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border that, according to industry, may result in delays and a lack of parts.
Toyota would not be able to store more than one day of stock at its Derbyshire plant, so production must be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future EU relations was “exactly calibrated to avoid such checks at the border.”
“We need an agreement. We want the best solution that will allow us to do what we want, and not just take advantage of the current success, but the full potential,” he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers shows that we need to be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain set.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but in the longer term it warned that additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately also pay for jobs.
Peter Tsouvallari, a representative at Unite, who has worked in Burnastone for 24 years, said: “We know from our experience that when jobs disappear, they don’t come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed by another week as the fight against top-level candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who examines the intervention of the Russian elections, the relations between Trump’s aides and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice on the part of the president.
Whether Trump will succeed the deputy attorney general and thereby threaten Mueller’s independence has fuelled Washington’s rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed with Trump the use of interrogation tools and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein didn't confirm it.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, announcing that he was going to step back.
Instead, on Thursday, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced.
Trump said he did not want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a meeting with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on the Fox News news channel on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein: “This date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may be delayed by another one week, taking into account all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But let’s look at it and keep the press on track, as always.”
Some journalists would argue that Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Ambassador Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the information loophole was not due to the disillusionment of TV journalists, although he added: "I do not object to the fact that they have been disappointed."
He then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The president is asking more questions and answers in the session than any president before him,” he said, adding evidence: “We’ve looked at these numbers.”
Information hours continue, Sanders confirmed, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly from the President of the United States of America, it’s much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do a lot of this and you’ve seen how we’ve done it in the last couple of weeks, so it’s happening during a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York, the president demonstrated why, before gathering journalists to take the stand on a free walk and sometimes with a strange appearance.
Health Minister Writes to EU Workers NHS Scotland Over Fears of Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Minister of Health has written to EU workers working in the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and wish to remain there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent her letter after the UK’s withdrawal from the EU was less than six months away.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs related to the status of EU citizens employed in its public law services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “In the summer negotiations have continued on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom and the EU, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the UK government has also made preparations for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate every employee's contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Employees from across the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie suffered from a severe head injury
Tennessee State Tigers backer Christion Abercrombie underwent an extraordinary cut after Saturday's head injury and beating 31:27 from Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ published.
Tennessee State Head Coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
"He fell into the village and just collapsed," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen while visiting, before he was placed on the stretcher, taken off the field for further inspection.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) that Abercrombie's operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center has ended.
Harris added that there are no details on the type/success of the injury and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student with a red shirt, was in his first season in Tennessee State after an overachiever from Illinois.
He had five fights on Saturday before leaving the game, which made a total of 18 matches this season.
Foreigners must pay a higher temple tax when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty if they buy real estate in the UK, using this additional money to help the homeless on the basis of new Tory plans
This step will hurt Corbyn’s quest to attract young voters
Temple tax is to be paid by those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance hopes it will create up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreigners will have to pay a higher temple fee if they buy real estate in the UK, using this extra money to help the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The movement is seen as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to offer them affordable housing and target people with high incomes.
Temple tax is imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom by directing the government's desire to fight against homelessness.
The additional fee - which is in addition to this temple tax, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on the second home and on purchases related to the advance - may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this move will create up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the properties purchased in London belong to non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get a home.
Many of the country's rich regions - especially in the capital - have become "devastating cities" thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in temple tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping real estate prices high when they buy land but do not use it, and urged Mayd to abandon the quotas of affordable homes in order to correct Britain’s “survival-related shame.”
Corbyn has announced a sweeping housing reform, including rent control and ending the plight of innocent people.
It also wants to give more power to the councils to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I promised that I would be committed to restoring the British prime minister’s dream – that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
The UK is always open to people who want to live, work and build their own lives here.
However, it is true that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as businesses abroad, are as easy to buy homes as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away and harsh sleeping conditions are a normal reality.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland’
Sunderland’s Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to become Scotland’s leader at some point.
Scottish (42) is excited by the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently third in League One, with only 3 points behind.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Champions League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got a B-class and that's the limit," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“But I grew up with my father in Scotland watching Hampden, and it’s always something that has pulled me back.
This opportunity comes only when I am successful in leading the club.”
Ross' predecessors were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he was not afraid of such big and well-known names, having previously held against both Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success is at the moment if I can take this club to the Champions League.”
Because of its structure and facilities, this club is undoubtedly part of the Champions League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get there, but I see myself as successful only if I manage to get the club back there.”
Ross has worked as a manager for only three years, previously serving as Dumbarton's deputy director and 15 months among Hearts' senior staff.
He then helped Allo recover from a third level drop and made St Mirren's lowest position the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now, when he was in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real crossroads,” he recalled taking over Alloa.
“I really believed that leadership was more appropriate for me than playing.
It seems strange, because I got it done, got a reasonable income, and enjoyed some peak moments.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I still experience it in terms of the tension and pressure of my work, but the management just seems right.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I’m doing it. I feel more comfortable now than ever before as an adult.”

According to research, the best time for the surface is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
Summer heat has improved the circulation of pubs in Britain, but more pressure has been put on restaurant chains.
The figures showed that pubs and bars grew by 2.7% in July, but restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, CGA’s representative for the business consulting firm, said: “Continuing the long-awaited participation of the Sunshine and England in the World Championships meant that July was similar to June, when pub attendance increased by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants went even harder.
In June, the trade in restaurants decreased by 1.8%, even worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars traded the most successfully, and to enjoy the most sought after restaurants the worst.
Food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurant-keepers.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between managed pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent over the month, while food sales fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of large social or sporting events will remain the biggest factor when it comes to sales outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains continue to fight, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the previous year is particularly painful in addition to the current price pressure.
A long and hot summer wouldn’t have come at a worse time for food business owners, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August provide some of the necessary relief.”
The growth in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand-related agencies.

One in five children have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents.
The study found that one in five children, some of them 11-year-olds, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 gymnasts found the growth of “wrong Insta” newspapers
News Raises Fear of Posting Sexual Content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a “principal residence” to show their parents.
The study found that one in five children, some of whom are just 11 years old, create secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 gymnasts found a noticeable increase in “wrong Insta” accounts (refer to sharing images on Instagram).
The news raised fears that sexual content would be posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a “principal account” designed for both parents to show and made acceptable to themselves.
One of his 13-year-old daughter’s secret pages discovered that a teenager had invited others to rape him.
Digital Awareness UK and the private-school association Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18 year-olds owned two profiles and half of them acknowledged the existence of personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing to see so many teenagers being lured into creating accounts online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Doyle will become Scottish Athletics’s first sports speaker on the board of directors
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the management board at the annual meeting of the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most acclaimed lightweight athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described what happened as an opportunity for sports fans to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidhi is respected everywhere in Scotland, in the UK and in other sports communities, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit from inviting him to lead,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to be a spokesperson for the athletes and I hope that I can make a real contribution to Scotland’s sport and contribute to its development.”
The American, who won four Olympic gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in total at 200 metres and 400 metres and now often shares his opinion on the BBC, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
She wrote on Twitter: “I got a seizure a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that whether I recover and if, to what extent, only shows time.
I’ve done a lot of work, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again, and I’m already doing speed training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages.”
Breast pump advertising, which compares women to cows, splits the internet into two
The breast pump company has shared the internet with two camps of advertising, where they are compared to nursing mother sledding cows.
To celebrate the presentation of the world’s first silent breast pump, Elvie, a consumer-focused technology company, has released an ironic music video to showcase the freedom this new pump gives to mothers who want to live.
Four real mothers dance in a haystack filled with cows and sing, “Yes, I’m a bitch, but you don’t see my tail” and “If you didn’t notice, they’re not flying, they’re my breasts.”
The Psalm repeats: “Pump, pump, feed the children, pump, pump, fill your dams with milk.”
However, the advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has generated similar opinions on the Internet.
Video viewers with 77,000 views and thousands of comments are of a different opinion. Many of them say that it illuminates the tentacles of the dairy industry.
“Using the blades to advertise this product was a very poor decision.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to milk production, but the difference is that they steal children from them for days after birth,” one wrote.
Elvie breast pump does not wipe the eye of the breastfeeding nurse (Elvie/Mother)
Another commenter said: “Understanding traumatizing for both mother and child.
But why not use these children to advertise the breast pump of mothers who can keep them?”
Someone added: Totally unsightly advertising.”
Part of it's advertising, and one woman thought the story was super-lunch.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy myself one if I'd still eat with my breast.
Pumping milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit of a twist, but let's take it as it is.
It’s a great product,” one wrote.
Another commented: “It’s fun advertising (often in their workplaces or watering) to pump and to mothers who feel like cows.
This advertisement does not praise or condemn the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they have all danced in the bras with non-eye-catching pumps.
The idea of the campaign is based on the saying that many breast milk pumping women feel like a cow.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or pipes and does not look like a breastfeeding monitor, giving women the freedom to move, keep children and even walk outdoors during pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD’s Ana Balar commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserves a bold and irritating introduction.
With the comparison of women’s expression options and cows in the dairy industry, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, while presenting in an entertaining and familiar way the extraordinary freedom of movement created by the new pump.
This isn't the first time the news has covered Elvie's pump.
During the London holiday, a visiting designer, Marta Jakubowski, appeared to be the mother of two children carrying the product.
Tens of thousands of migrant children went quietly to camp on the Texas border.
The number of children of displaced migrants has risen sharply, although monthly border restrictions have remained quite the same. Partially because the Trump administration’s enforced harsh rhetoric and policies have made it difficult with the help of child-rearing sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors are document-based immigrants and they are afraid to violate the possibility of staying in their country, requiring the right to care for the child.
The risk increased in June, when national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults in the household could provide fingerprints and data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, senior immigration and customs officer, admitted to Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for financial support from non-participating minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested lacked a criminal past.
“Nearly 80 percent of sponsors or those who belong to the sponsor’s household are staying in the country illegally and a large number of them are criminally background.
So we will continue to follow them," Mr Albence said.
In order to deal with children more quickly, the officials enforced new rules, which require some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest. Previously, the shelter was said to be 60 days after the arrest.
Many protect the immigration judge from their legal content via videoconference, to come to the scene.
Unsuitables for release are quickly sent out of the country.
According to the shelter workers, and based on the system reports published in recent months – the longer the child stays in custody, the more likely they are to become nervous or depressed, which can lead to violent demonstrations or escape attempts.
According to lawyers, these concerns are more topical in large detention facilities such as Tornillo, where a child’s difficulty may be left between two eyes due to its size.
They added that moving children to the campsite without giving enough time to get used to feelings or say goodbye to friends can lead to trauma, which many are already struggling with.
Syria Demands U.S., French, and Turkish Occupying Forces Leave Immediately
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on the United Nations General Assembly to return home to Syria, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualemi, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces on the Syrian soil were illegally on the pretext of terrorist attacks and are being dealt with accordingly.
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally,” he said in the assembly.
Moualem claimed that Syria's "war on terror is almost over": since 2011, more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have left their homes.
He said Damascus will continue “the fight in this holy war until we have cleared the entire Syrian territory” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign force present.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish units and Syrian Arab forces, who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 troops have been deployed in France since the war.
Speaking on the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return are appropriate and he accused the unwarranted fears that prevent the arrival of refugees of spreading to parts of the West.
“We asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with their deployment,” he said.
“They’re politicizing something that’s just a humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given recovery aid until there is an end to the war between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which will create the last rebel stronghold in the Idlib buffer zone, has created an opportunity for political talks to move forward.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented the widespread seizure of Russian-backed Syrian forces with a population of three million in the province.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that military action will kill jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front soldiers, who will be “destroyed.”
Staffan de Mistura, a UN envoy, hopes to convince a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem made requests for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work could be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned of intervention.
Why is Trump elected for a second term?
According to this logic, Trump could win the next election in 2020, if the resignation and scandal have not previously ended his presidency, as the liberals are likely to want.
What would undoubtedly be the “most exciting end of the presidential diadem!”
At the moment, viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have doubled to more than 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers per peak hour. Compared to its four-year membership of 1.7 million viewers, their number has increased. MSNBC gets “The Rachel Maddow Show” through 3.5 million cable viewers have kept this rating high during the main evenings.

Elsewhere, cash flow moves to the most urgent White House range
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district will receive cash flow thanks to the reorganisation of the congressional district, getting the two market-dominated businesses to the same place.
This led to the re-election of the Pittsburgh area's Democratic Republic representative, Conor Lamb, who won a seat in the second district last spring in an extraordinary election.
Rep. Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former Pennsylvania 12th district, which in large part overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were changed after a decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January, so the old districts were divided into anti-constitutional constituencies, favoring Republicans.
The new 17th election has come to an end with a campaign that is smothered by the financial divisions of the major parties – the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a button win in the March 18th Pennsylvania congressional district election.
A Republican has been around for decades and President Donald Trump has won the district by 20 points.
Political opinion-makers have given the Democrats a small advantage.
U.S. El Salvador Sentenced for Supporting China, Resigned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, which was a minor blow to Washington.
Mr. Trump met with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Vare in a friendly atmosphere in June 2017 and held a Panama hotel until the partners expelled the Trump company’s management team.
Foreign Ministry officials have decided to call back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama the heads of the U.S. diplomatic mission, as the ministry’s press secretary Heather Nauert said earlier this month that these countries were no longer supporting Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, was scheduled to be punished, including for drug surveillance, development and economic growth.
The proposed sanctions, which included the reduction of financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American state and its high unemployment and the number of killings.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting, aimed at security and economic prosperity, in order to organise a continuation of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as an attempt to advance the development of the Amtrak.
But in mid-September, senior officials explained that they wanted to continue the meeting and end the discussion of any El Salvador sanctions.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence, speaking at the mid-October meeting, is now being considered to speak on the government’s positions.
And three U.S. envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House press secretary, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss the national deliberations on the request to remain anonymous.
These discussions were confirmed by an analyst close to the government, who also spoke on the request to remain anonymous.
History of learning
Next, it may be that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller is publishing a report on Trump’s possible justice, which has a lot of evidence in the state archives.
Mueller is also allegedly investigating in his investigation whether the Trump campaign is related to the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress is to change sides, Trump must make it clear in this body that he is going to speak again to voters and perhaps even to judges of his peers.
There are a lot of agates here, and I don't want to point out that Trump's misbehavior or his European colleagues' backsliding is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which affects the durability of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler if only the West would have prevented him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We were bored and ran out of opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of homicide.
History goes around such turning points and the merciless march of democracy gets closer or delays further.
The Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What do we do when Trump triggers Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the water since it was reported that he made a secret suggestion last year to record the president and speculated on the inadequacy of his position.
Rosenstein says that The Times' statement is inaccurate.
“How do you respond if the investigation by the recently requested FBI side of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if it is upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the midterm elections if Trump is to be held accountable?
When these tests fail, democracy goes on a long winter holiday.
But I don't think we're going to fail because we've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was accused by the same Nazi regime in Auschwitz, who once took over and used our embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me a light from the candles of the Sabbath on a table with a hawthorn.

The Rangers' Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna battle
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that you will win over Australia, which followed an impressive streak earlier this month against Villarreal in Spain, will put them in a strong position to become a European League Group G.
The knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to make the first appearance of the season before a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but believes the Rangers can use this result as a jumper for better results.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a strong opponent,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went to the game, believing we could achieve something and we left the game with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but in general it was a fair result.
They were better in the first half of the game and we were better in the second half.
Thursday will once again be a big and important European night.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a difficult game because they got a good result in their last game, but since the people support us, I am sure that we will be able to get together and get a good result.
Last year was a tough year, thanks to that, I was injured and changes took place inside the club, but now we all have a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can move on now, leave the previous season behind and be successful.”
Women can’t sleep because of the fear of retirement insurance.
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said that they talk about the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
“People want family members to take care of them, but at the same time they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
But we should start with that.
Talk to your husband and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if they don’t know your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and family, discussing where and how to get care, as these choices can be extremely important in terms of costs.
Consult your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan for how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options in relation to long-term care may include, for example, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a financial value to help cover these costs, or a wealth of self-insurance - as long as you have the necessary funds.
Prepare your own legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles already in advance.
Take care of your health care credentials to identify a trusted caregiver who will monitor your medical care and ensure that specialists will comply with your wishes when you are not able to communicate on your own.
You should also consider confidence in your finances.
Choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid even if you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and she’s on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions related to medications and allergies?
Write down these things so that you are ready, if necessary.
“It’s not just about the financial side, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin said.
“What medications are needed?
Who takes care of the dog?
Put it all in place.”
Mastermind was shot several times in Ilfracombe
The mastermind was shot several times from the air rifle when he was on his way home after a night spent outside.
In the 1940s, the victim was shot in Ilfracombe, in the Oxford Grove area, in Devon's chest, abdomen, and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 p.m., as a random act.
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police are asking all witnesses to contact him.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the number of deaths is still rising.
Since the connection has been interrupted, the rescuers have not received any information from the Donggala regent located north of Palu, which remains closer to the epicenter as a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located on the western bank of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was unexpectedly hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
The regent of Donggala is an area of over 300 km (180 miles) in the Sulawesi Archipelago.
The regency, which is an administrative area under the province, had an estimated 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
In the province, it is also important to mine nickel, which is mainly concentrated on the coast of Morowali, Sulawesi.
Indonesia's Disaster Relief Agency says tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed in the Donggala tsunami and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996, the tsunami hit the western part of Donggala, killing nine.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In March and early April, several strong earthquakes hit the western tip of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias on the Sumatra coast.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck Indonesia's most populated island in the south, creating a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An area near Padang, the western Sumatra province's capital, hit a 7.6-degree earthquake.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the Sumatra islands - Mentawai Island, capturing up to 10 meters high of tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's regent Acehi, sowing destruction and panic, reminding people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
The tsunami did not occur at the time, but more than 100 people were killed in collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesian tourist resort Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, in connection with suspicion of domestic violence, interference with the domestic violence report and opposition to the arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman tried to inform police of alleged crimes, Palin picked up the phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pre-Trial Office and is being held against an unsecured bail of $500, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday announcing that he was "not to blame in any way", the news network said.
Palin faces three A-class misdemeanours, which means he can be expected to face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B felony punishable by one-day imprisonment and a $2000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
In connection with the alleged attack, the police called his mother Sarah Palin.
The case is currently being discussed at the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of assaulting at home, interfering with the report on domestic violence and possessing weapons, all in a drunken state.
His girlfriend said the man shot him in the face.
Veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 when she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD, which stems from her service in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake Followed by Tsunami: Hundreds of Killed
In Indonesia, at least 384 people have been killed by an earthquake that struck Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are not functioning and the number of people killed is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the outskirts of Sulawesi's central city, which is located in the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of the earthquake.
At the time of the tsunami, hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in Palu.
Federal Prosecutors in NYC Seek Rare Death Penalty Suspected in Terrorist Attack
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected in a New York terror attack in which eight people were killed. This rare punishment has not been carried out for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used the Home Depot rental car to attack bicycle paths along the West Side roads in Lower Manhattan, including both pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
According to the death warrant applications filed in the southern New York area, prosecutors must prove to justify the death warrant that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and also caused serious bodily harm intentionally.
In both cases, there is a possible death penalty on the basis of court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury presented a 22-point indictment to Saipov, which included eight murder charges, along with extortion, which are generally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime, and the charge of rape and rape.
The attack presupposed "deep planning and planning," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's actions as "responsible, cruel and deliberate."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov caused injuries, damage and damage to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagneucco's family and friends," he said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
New York’s Southern District District Court has ruled that the last death toll procedure has been in place for 10 years.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death warrant was last enforced in New York City in 1953 in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, where the couple was executed after being convicted in a conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an indigenous Uzbek, showed a lack of regret in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he had told investigators that he was happy.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired by the attack to conduct ISISE videos viewed on his phone.
According to police, he also wanted the ISISE flag displayed in his hospital palace.
In the 22-point indictment, he did not take the blame.
David Patton, a Saipov national defender, said they were “clearly disappointed” in the ruling.
“We believe that the decision to apply for a death sentence will prolong the trauma of all those involved in the matter,” Patton said in a statement.
Previously, Saipovi’s defense team asked prosecutors not to apply for a death warrant.
Tory MP NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the People’s Army” during a Tory conference protest today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested to conduct negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative House of Commons, said in Birmingham in March that the UK would “be out by now” if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May faces the problem of her deeply broken lines of conciliation, which the conservatives, who supported staying behind, have stressed by joining the city in their anti-Brexit protest.
The prime minister is in trouble keeping his Chequers plan on track amid Brexit supporters, Remains and the EU's attacks.
The Allies demanded that he continue the deal with Brussels despite the counter-attack and force the Eurosceptics and liberals to choose between their package and the "combat".
Bone told Leave Means Leave at a rally in Solihull that he wanted to "give up Chequers' plan".
He suggested taking Farage as a partner and giving him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"It's his responsibility that we're out by now," he said.
Mr Wellingborough added: “I stand outside Brexit, but we must abandon Chequers’ plan.”
Reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected the recommendations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The opinion that British people have changed their minds and want to stay is not true.”
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also in March and told reporters: “I only say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and with our activists who are actually walking down the street and choosing us at all.
Please leave Chequers' plan and start listening."
With a message addressed to Mayle, he added: “Prime ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians at the rally must be put to “feel the heat” if they plan to deny the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“It is now a question of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to deny Brexit and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let that happen.’”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit, uncomfortable to feel.
“We will mobilize the people’s army of the country that gave us victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, municipal, proud Britain.”
At the same time, the remnants marched through Birmingham before the two-hour rally held in the centre of the city.
A handful of activists chanted "Towers Against Brexit" slogans after the group was formed this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Liberals looked at the conservatives for the security issues that became part of their party’s implementation of the conference.
“These are people who say that IT systems can take place and all of the technology to Canada and more, to smooth border crossings, to cross-border trade to Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's considering running for president after November election
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday in the West Massachusetts suburb.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for the next election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was the vice president of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that he could prove to be against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the peace after Trump took office.
The presenter asked if he was planning to run for president.
Warren replied, “Women have time to go to Washington and fix our broken government, that is to say, at the front.”
Shooting of LSU Sims took place
LA Police in Baton Rouge said on Saturday that the suspect in the Wayde Sims shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who took place on Friday, had been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m. at the ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting Friday, asking for help to identify a man visible in the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University town early Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims got a head injury and died as a result,” Murphy J. Paul, a police officer, told media on Saturday, via 247sport.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and got a hearing from Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and he confessed to being at the scene, possessing a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested in the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Nearly 2-meter-old Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 of them in the starting line-up, averaging 17.4 minutes, dropping 5.6 points and taking 2.9 balls per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championship after team count gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment it became clear that Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, that the order of the Mercedes team plays a big role in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and left Hamilton almost uneasy when he defended his position for the first two times and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first went to boxing and left Hamilton's group behind in a tight traffic that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went into the boxing round later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went to lead the side when the Ferrari driver left the innings to go free after a third-round try to defend it with a double move.
Max Verstappen started the race behind the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first round for his 21st birthday.
He then ran the race most of the time, driving the rubbers towards the finish line and passing Kimi R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen, taking fourth place.
He eventually made his way to the 44th round of boxing, but failed to increase the speed of the last eight rounds, giving R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen fourth place.
Today is a difficult day because Valtteri did a good job all week and was a real gentleman by my side.
“The team has done a great job of making sure they have one of two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump on Saturday insulted Senator Dianne Feinstein for the incident because she had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at the West Virginia assembly, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on what was happening in the Senate at the moment, which shows that people are “true, false and false.”
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and is happening right now in the Senate in a couple of days is that you see angry and angry, ugly, rebellious and false people,” he said.
“When you look at press releases and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question “Did you leak the document?” – “Ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't play."
Wait a minute.
Whether we played... no, we didn't," he added with the appearance of the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter in July about the charges against Kavanaugh and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his workplace.
The Hill reported, “I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations or leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to keep my confidentiality, and at his request, I did the same.”
But his denial did not suit the president, who commented during Saturday’s rally: “You know, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's one of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court’s candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president hinted that Democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power without selecting the means.
You see this bitterness and resentment. They don’t care who they hurt, who they need to take over in order to get power and leadership,” the president of the media said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5: 3 Belfast Giants
Giant Patrick Dwyer opened two doors against Dundee
The Dundee Stars won the Friday Elite League rematch with Belfast Giants, who lost to Dundee 5:3.
The Giants started the game with two gates to lead Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier from the gate.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team's lead before Dwyer led the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard equalised Dundee's position before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's gates secured their victory.
It was Adam Keefe's third loss for the men in the elite league. They came to Belfast on Friday night to win the Dundeed position 2:1.
It was the fourth half of the season, of which the Giants won three previous games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford, as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
Sullivan brought the home team back to the game quickly in the first third at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie hit the lead in 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer assured the Giants that he would lead before the first break, hitting his second gate at the end of the first third of his night.
On the home field, the players regrouped and Bouchard leveled them again, hitting the number one goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time at the end of the second third of the game, securing a win in the last third of his team's offensive zone.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, will face Milton Keynes in the next game.
The pilot is dying to save hundreds of people from the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure the safe airlift of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
A major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday caused a tsunami that killed more than 800 people, many of whom have been left unaccounted for.
The region is teeming with strong aftershocks and many people are trapped in the ruins of the town of Palu.
Despite the fact that 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues escaped from the floating airport tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri, he refused to leave.
He stayed at the post office to ensure the safe airlift of Batik Air Flight No. 6321, which was at the same time on the border.
Then he jumped out of the air tower, thinking it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirai confirmed that his decision could save hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We set up a helicopter to transport him from Kalimantan Balikpapan to another major city hospital.
Unfortunately, he died in the morning, even before the helicopter arrived at Palus.
“We were extremely sad when we heard about it,” the press secretary added.
At the same time, authorities fear that the death toll could rise to thousands. According to the National Disaster Relief Agency, access to the city of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was restricted.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s press secretary, said: “The number of victims may increase because the bodies of many victims are still under the rubble and have not been rescued.”
The 6-meter-long waves devastated the town of Palu, where massaging takes place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency assistance brings new victims every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is accelerating to help the survivors, but we can’t say what they can find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but the situation may get even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palus on Sunday and told the country’s military: “Please work nights and days to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready for that?” he told CNN.
The Indonesian city of Lombok was hit by an earthquake earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini airline claims one man has disappeared after a lagoon crash
While it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely been successfully evacuated from the plane, the airliner now claims that one man was missing, who was driving a plane that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to find one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find a man.
The air carrier did not immediately respond to the passenger’s details, such as questions concerning his age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the Chuuki Island airfield on landing.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the carrier and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed far from the lagoon's airfield.
Some witnesses thought the plane was crossing the airfield.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers were able to intercept an emergency exit into the water on a floating plane.
He mentioned that the cabin crew was panicking and screaming and that he was getting a little head trauma.
The U.S. Navy and sailors who worked on a nearby shore also helped rescue by using full-blown boats to take people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters underwater.
Data from the aviation safety network show that 111 people have died in aviation accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
An analyst prepares a schedule for the evening when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor’s office closed a case about a man being charged with burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, spent several hours as an expert observer analyzing intelligence data.
He told the jury how he used cell phone extracts to recreate the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said she received location information from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to the young man's earlier claims.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford entered the courtroom on Saturday and admitted that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said he had been in Sanford's car, Sanford said Tellis "was complaining because my car was in Nashville."
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers before the girl's death for about two weeks.
The phone scans showed that the women had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, Orders deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"She wiped the girl out of her life," Hale said.
The defendant is scheduled to make his trial on Sunday.
The judge said that he believes the case will go to the jury later in the day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to fight negative genre definition by adding positive messages to the music.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved away from the beginnings of its political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of hip-hop and make conscious hip-hop again popular.
Bands like The Fugees and Common have recently gained popularity in the UK thanks to bands like Akala and Lowkey.
The next black one?
New York Child Custody Suspends Racial Message After Couple of Courts
A New York babysitter complains about a discriminatory dismissal in court after a couple of unexperienced messages from their parents, where the mother lamented that the babysitter is “another black woman.”
Couples deny that they are racists, compared to blackmailing the situation.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her dismay when she learned that their new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband, saying: “EIIIIIIIIIIIIIII, THE PERSONALITY OF THE RECORDS.”
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt uncomfortable after his prophet understood Miss Maurice, claimed that their social guardian, who was African-American, had done a bad job and had been expecting a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice sues a couple to get compensation for the dismissal he wants to receive daily in the amount of $350 in the next six months, and the same work he was initially hired to do, but without a contract.
“I want to show it to them to look at it, so do it,” he told The Post, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have rejected the claim that they are racists, saying that ending working with Maurice was a reasonable act because they feared that after the girl's insult, they could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t think about.
He's not a racist.
"We're not racists," husband Joel Plasco told The Post.
“But would you let your children keep a man with whom you have been unfaithful, even if it was unintentional?
His new-born son?
Come on, now."
Commenting on the comparison with extortion, Plasco said his wife was two months away from the birth of the child and was "in a very difficult situation".
“Would you go against someone like that?
It’s not very good,” added the investment banker.
While the case is still going on, public opinion has quickly condemned a couple on social media, where they are severely criticized for their behavior and thinking.
New Letter Reveals Paddington Publishers Feared Readers Aren't Dealing With Talking Bears
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote: “It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of a person who read it for the first time before publication.
It’s really fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
He said that his father, inspired by writing a children's book from a small toy box, worked as a cameraman for the BBC, would have been optimistic about his rejection of his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was marked by the death of his father last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom he described as “a very important member of our family,” he added that his father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
“He was quite a quiet man and was not a proud man,” he said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like a feeling when your child achieves something: you’re proud of them, even though it’s not directly your achievement.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always recognized Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
On his way home, his daughter was rushed to the hospital in Nice to Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked tirelessly to save his life.
“They called regularly to say that her condition was very bad and that they do not believe she will survive,” said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nadi, who said my daughter was going to die in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The drugs that doctors gave him to keep his heart beating had begun to disappear quietly and he was leaving the body.
He had been dead for some time before that, and now all systems began to stop working.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing what was going on.
I couldn’t breathe, cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourns her daughter, went on a plane with other passengers who knew nothing about her passing.
“No one knew that,” he said.
“I kept my head on the ground and tears flowed all this time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a burst of terrible compassion for Nadi on that plane.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her.”
Leinava woman's postcards prevent suicide bridge
Two women who have lost their beloved suicide knuckles work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have glued cards to the Wales Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13, when he suffered from depression, and 18, when he killed himself.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
45-year-old Prl Davis, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile makes the whole room shine.”
Despite this, he stopped working before he died because he was “in a very bad place with his own.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he had taken a life of his own.
Mrs Davis said, “I’m constantly concerned that it has a domino effect.”
Mrs. Davis created these maps “to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even with their friend.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for years, lost her 15-year-old partner shortly after the death of her husband's mother.
"He didn't say he'd feel bad or be depressed or anything," he said.
“We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point during the first Christmas holiday – when the kids opened their presents, he had no eyes or anything with them.”
Ms Humphreys said the man’s death was a terrible trauma to them, but they have to deal with it: “It’s tearing the wound into a whole family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to go ahead and continue the fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on top of hair while FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could actually get something that he wanted – a limited amount of time and scope – we might be able to achieve unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “meet” in the midst of a permanent partisan standoff.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate it?
Their reluctance was due to the timing.
The midterm elections are in just five weeks, on November 6th. If Republicans are not doing very well, they are visibly weakened in their intentions to get the desired man to be the subject of the highest court in the world.
George W. Bush has taken the phone to call senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to cast at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast a decisive vote and to be confirmed by Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of troops 'disappears' under Kim's government
South Korea’s legislature has said that the number of North Korean troops in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Conciliation, said that compared to the 2011 troop-runs (2706), their numbers fell last year (1127).
Mr Park said the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a larger number of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
A large number of North Koreans have been offered citizenship of South Korea.
The newspaper Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized area located between the two Koreas.
China takes the fugitives as illegal immigrants rather than as refugees and often forcibly sends them back home.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang to hold talks on the decommissioning of nuclear weapons.
This happened after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, where they generally promised to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of failing to make progress in sanctions.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no security in our country, and under such circumstances, we do not in any way agree to unilaterally make ourselves the first to be disarmed,” Ri told the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said the man was unfit to be a judge of the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the opposition leader of the House of Representatives, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said the man was temperamentally unfit to work as a Supreme Court judge.
Pelosi expressed his opinion during a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
“I inevitably noticed that if a woman had performed in this way, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction, which concerned Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening speech, describing his family and high school years as almost a scream from time to time, and was left speechless at times.
He also explicitly condemned members of the Democratic Party who were on the committee, calling the charges against him over the loss of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential election “a gross and coordinated assassination of the angry liberals.”
According to Pelosi, he believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that the man did not fit as a judge of the Supreme Court, because it showed that he was being held against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with these talks and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi remained modest when asked if he would try to relinquish Kavanaugh's office if the Democrats were to get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m saying so much – if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he’s not only fit to be a judge of the Supreme Court, but he’s also not fit for the court where he’s currently working,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeals of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he is concerned about the rulings against Kavanaugh's possible Affordable Care Act (Health Care Act – Translator's Note) or Roe v. Wade (Abortion Acting President – Translator's Note) because men are considered conservative.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would quash some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“At the moment, there is no time when a hysterical hanged person could become a judge and wait for us to say whether it is not nice,” Pelosi said.
And women have to wear it.
It is a just choice of words, a fleeting hatred of months and years, and he will not escape from it without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do you?”
He continued: “I got help from a woman who was somewhere in charge; she said that she was crying as well when she got angry, but she developed a method that was that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You know, I guess.
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.”
Bitches are partially accepted as a way out of anger, because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most cherished memories is in an early workplace with the majority of men in the office, where I found myself once inexplicably angry at crying when an older woman – a strict leader whom I had always been a little afraid of – dragged me on the edge of a cliff and into a stairwell.
"Don't ever show yourself to them crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're an asshole.
They think you’re sad and it gives them satisfaction.”
Patricia Schroeder, a Republican from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on the man’s presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was left on board a yacht named Monkey Business, and the campaign ended, Schroeder was deeply upset that there was no reason why he should not think of running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me, laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the candidate, and the last thing they needed was someone else’s joining.”
Someone said it was like "The White Lion and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was about to end, he had been late with fundraising and he promised not to run if he didn’t get two million dollars.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, gave him only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a promotion?” he thought.
When he delivered a speech announcing that he was not running an official campaign, feelings—thanks to the people who supported him, irritability to the system that made it difficult for him to turn to voters instead of to raise money and delegates, and anger to sexism—came from him so hard to win.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled the press reaction against him.
“I would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they're writing to my gravestone.
"Did you cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be beneficial to Beijing
The openings of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the inter-state divide could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning this year, imposing taxes on important Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, essentially imposing taxes on half of goods arriving in the United States from China.
Beijing has responded to the same at any given time, diluting the last five-to-ten percent tariffs worth $60 billion to American goods.
China has pledged to let the US respond to the injury, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to be seen as soon as possible.
Getting Washington back would mean surrendering to demands, but publicly bowing to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing gets its cards right, the trade war with the US can support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that cause another country to lose control of the economy is actually much more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged,” said Security researcher Abigail Grace, who focuses on the Asian Center for New Research.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready for the return of refugees
Syria says the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for more than seven years of aid after the war to rebuild the country.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“At present, the situation on the territory of the country is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
There are now all conditions under which refugees who have left the country due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods could voluntarily return to the country.
According to the United Nations, 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime was happy to accept aid for the reconstruction of the country.
At the same time, he stressed that the country did not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that supported the uprising.
Winner of the Ryder European Caricature Competition in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Caricature Championships by defeating the U.S. team in the Le Golf National golf course near Paris, France, with a final score of 16.5 vs 10.5.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team received 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
Phil Mickelson, who had been a U.S. star during the entire tournament, broke a par-3 tie in 16 waters, giving up the win to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari beamed in all his laps, becoming one of the four players who have achieved a score of 5 : 0 : 0 in the current 1979 tournament format.
Jordan Spiethele was eliminated 5&4 by Thorbjorn Olesen, a Danish at the bottom of the European team.
The world’s best player Dustin Johnson advanced Ian Poulter with 2 and 1 in England, to whom it could be Ryder’s last caricature.
Of Ryder’s eight career-winning veterans, Sergio Garcia was the most-winning European player of all time, with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold myself back.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the caricature back.
It’s a team spirit and I’m glad I was able to help,” said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He gives a kick back to fellow compatriot Jon Rahmi, who won Sunday's singles game against U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1.
“I’m extremely proud to have won Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him up,” Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now he has a career-high Ryder score of 13:21:3.
Odd statistics for one of the best players of all time, who has won the title of 14 Grand Prix, leaving only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had struggled to find fairways throughout the weekend; the exception was Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the team's disappointment, "I'm proud of the guys, they were the hearts.
There was a moment in the morning when we put pressure on the Europeans.
We fought with them.
Hats off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players did a very good job.
Let's get together, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Caricature Committee, and move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to wear a hat.
We played better.”
