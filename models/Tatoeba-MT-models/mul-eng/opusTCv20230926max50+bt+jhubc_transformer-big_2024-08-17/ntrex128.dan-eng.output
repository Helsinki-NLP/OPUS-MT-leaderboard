Politicians in Wales are afraid to “like fools”
There was concern among some members of the Welsh National Assembly about a proposal to change their title to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It was created because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs from across the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could give rise to ridicule.
A Labour party member said his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal jump from MWP to Muppet (fools).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a bill introducing the name changes, said: "The final decision on appointments that Members of Parliament will receive is, of course, up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, which had broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members (Wales MPs) or WMPs, but the MWP option gained the most support in a public consultation.
AMs are seemingly proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement can prove difficult for the Speaker of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to draft a bill on the amendments within a few weeks.
The bill on reforms contains other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs will be given the final vote on what to call when the bill is debated.
Macedonians hold a vote to change the country’s name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "North Macedonia".
The vote is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that their northern neighbor’s name is a requirement on Greece’s territory and has long protested Macedonia’s attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says he will veto the vote.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's will be silent as the churches in Harlem fight
“The older people I’ve talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
"Today there are none of the parts."
He said it was understandable that the bars would disappear.
“People are socializing in other ways these days,” he said.
“Bars no longer make up the neighborhood’s day-to-day living room, where people enter on a daily basis.”
With regard to churches, he worries that the money raised in selling assets does not last long, and that they “become back to where they started” sooner or later.
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of the kind of people who don’t help the neighborhood’s recurring deadlines.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings are white,” he says, “and it breathes further into the development where these churches eventually close completely, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into condominiums will become members of the churches.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who headed a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the primary shopping streets in Harlem that would not employ or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's sons-in-law made plans to restore the building, they ordered the bell.
Priest David Johnson, Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the bell game "the watches of the poor".
The expert who played at the bell game in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first time in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger time game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't find a replacement for him.
What has happened in St. Martin's over the past couple of months has been a complicated story about architects and contractors, some of which were acquired by church leaders, others by the diocese.
In July, the Congregational Council – the leading body of the parish, made up of leading laymen – wrote to the diocese about concerns that the diocese “would try to push the expenses forward” to the Congregational Council, even though the Congregational Council had not been involved in hiring the architects and patrons as clerks.
Some of the members of the congregation complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old on dive after lobster in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday as he dived into lobsters in California on the first day of the lobsters season, officials say.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says that he thought it was just excitement about catching a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
"All his collarbone was ripped up," said Hammel, looking as he reached the boy.
"I called for everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported in critical condition.
It's not clear what kind of shark it attacked.
Lifeguard Larry Giles said in a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the route from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security reasons and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's takes up the competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a range of beauty products with special assistants in the style of department stores.
As part of a major effort to enter the UK beauty market, which has a value of GBP 2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion and home products are declining. The larger ranges of beauty products are tested in 11 stores around the country and launched in several stores next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty products comes as supermarkets look for new products for shelves that were previously used for televisions, microwaves and residential products.
Sainsbury’s says they are doubling their range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are introduced for the first time.
The existing assortments from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with branded areas in style with them as seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunches the range of Boutique makeup, so the majority of products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, the fragrance store Fragrance Shop tests stalls in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon in the south of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham later in the year.
Online shopping and a trend towards buying small amounts of food daily from local shoppers means that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury’s, has said the stores are going to look like department stores, as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury’s has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of groceries and have made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 1900s, but the collaboration ended with a dispute over how the profits from the pharmacies in the supermarkets should be distributed.
The new strategy comes, after Sainsbury’s sold their pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have changed the look and decor of our range of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the immersive environment and the practical locations mean that we are now a compelling destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'surprised' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
Dragons star Peter Jones left "surprise" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
This Morning host, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons’ The Star Peter Jones furious after she pulls out of their lucrative lifestyle fire at the last minute – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “surprised” when the popular TV woman during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant she no longer had enough time for their homeware and accessories.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she left Truly while Jones flew out of the UK to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: “Truthly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would have been a long-term project that she would deal with for the next couple of decades.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a stock full of goods in the Marlow headquarters, which are already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the announcement from This Morning host, one of the UK’s highest-earning stars, could cost the company millions due to major investments in products – from pillows to candles to clothing and home products – and the potential for further delays in the launch.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin has been in a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the fire ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business move."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He made fun of the criticism he would get from the news media to make a comment that "isn't a president worthy" and to be so positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody to a news host.
"I gave up nothing."
He noted that Kim is interested in a more meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "similar reaction" from the United States in relation to North Korea's initial action against disarmament.
He noted that the United States instead continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure going.
Trump took a more optimistic view in the speech at his election meeting.
"It's going very well with North Korea," he said.
“There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his attempt to improve Kim's relationship had created positive results - ending missile tests, aiding the release of hostages, and the return of ground debris from U.S. military personnel.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake ravage the island and kill hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organizations were told, for example, that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population was homeless, a national state of disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international relief.
“In many cases, it has unfortunately been clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Preparedness Committee, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency response.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but apparently a tsunami is missing, and it has likely affected the death toll.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship, which has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims, is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia’s inadequate infrastructure a central point in his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
However, Mr Joko’s administration has been plagued by lack of funding in line with next year’s election campaign.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge equals Chelsea at the last minute
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, while his team was behind by 1-0.
He pointed to the ball with his left foot before making a high shot towards the outermost pole.
The ball flew high above the field towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was just about getting into that position, getting into the ball. Players like Shaq are always trying to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, and I made a single touch. I didn't think much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the semi-finals, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea striker delivered with the heel back to Mateo Kovacic before setting the pace on the midfield and sprinting into the Liverpool half of the track.
Kovacic made a quick one-two on the midfield.
He then made a long delivery that brought Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defence and finished against the farthest pole with a shot with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will compete against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Death toll from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to the country’s disaster preparedness early Sunday.
Many were reported trapped in the rubble from buildings that fell after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the judges’ scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters of high waves, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The town of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed at 7:55 at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people in the area who saw or heard something to step forward.
Police Assistant Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I would urge anyone who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have been involved with dashcam, to contact us as they may have information that may be critical to the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon are friends who think they know the woman who arrived at the site to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and police say they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but gets to know the police that no one is allowed into the building.
He was stunned when he heard what had happened.
Residents will now be told that it will take several hours before they can enter again.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman arrives.
She keeps repeating, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m. there were two police cars inside the fence and another car just outside.
A number of police officers were inside the lockdown and monitored the apartment complex.
All with information please write a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and inform log 247 on September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the latest memorial to be struck by discussion of "rewriting history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical, Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s proposal as “crazy” and an “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in connection with the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would become a target.
The image storm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for his predecessor Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s stunning depiction of Cromwell is a testimony to 19th-century attitudes and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of praise.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate picture is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is absolutely certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure who represents one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of praise and remembrance.”
Dr<0xC3><0xA4>bergris attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, who is only identified under his surname "Yuan", was found dead with an exaggerated pulsar wound and soaked in blood near a grass market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the grate next to it was open.
He said there was a large orna with blood in his mouth.
A forensic study confirmed that the 250 kg pig had bit the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and swollen,” said the cousin, who goes by the surname “Wu,” in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from security cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 p.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousins.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while police collect evidence at the scene of the crime.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
This is one of the rare occurrences, but there have been previously recorded cases in which pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 295 kg was bitten by a Welsh farmer against his tractor, into which his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just doctors.
The naps, they're very curious... they're not going to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to provide heavy rain in much of the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters off Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will provide heavy rain with flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had won at 38 m/s, a Category 1 hurricane, at 10 am (Denmark time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure outlet over the Pacific Ocean is forming, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will provide up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture will interact with the low-pressure discharger that is coming closer, creating heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storms, liquid precipitation and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical humidity will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over much of Arizona.
There is a high probability of storms with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out into the desert on foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn gusts into bubbling rivers and thunder will create strong local winds and create dust blow.<0x3C>/seg>
The approaching low-pressure discharge will provide heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall of over 13 mm, which can result in smaller amounts of liquid precipitation and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in their rainy season.
Widespread tropical rainforests will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continues on Wednesday.
In October, there may be major temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic gets cooler, but it remains reasonably warm in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern areas.
There may be up to 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long climate outlook indicates that there is a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million saw the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million saw Thursday's gripping testimony from the nominee to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle continued with stations that interrupted the usual programs to tell about Friday’s late development: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh in a drunken state grinned at her and tried to take her clothes off for a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he is 100 percent sure that it did not happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million people saw it on Friday.
The company recorded average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not immediately available from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring how many people see programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it’s a sight figure that’s equivalent to a game during the NFL playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose voice-over hosts have strongly backed up the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was arrested for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, while protesters shouted at him as he tried to take an elevator to the hearing in the judging committee.
He stood with a downward glance for several minutes as he was peeled out, and CNN broadcast live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, saying before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All the television stations covered live a few hours later, when the judging committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should proceed to a vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote for during the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee the following week, which the Democrats, who are in the lower house, had requested.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election was influential because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister Accuses Critics of ‘Politics’ With Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU to "play politics" with Britain's future and undermine national interests. It happened in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson presented his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs was “completely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of being behind the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on suspicion of negligent manslaughter, police in Baton Rouge said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the match.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, the CBS subsidiary WAFB reported.
After Simpson's interrogation, police said he confessed to the shooting at Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish medical examiner issued a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a wound from a gunshot wound that went from head to neck.
The police department says a task force from Louisiana State Police, the state police lab, police from Southern University and citizens in the area have assisted with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports leader Joe Alleva thanked the police in the area for their "care and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“That’s the kind of thing you’re always afraid of,” Wade said.
Volcano spits ash over Mexico City
Ashes, spilt from the volcano Popocatepetl, have reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater, and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitored the space and shakes over several times.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ashes on car windows in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters seeking independence clashed with unemployables as several thousand took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarising vote on independence.
A group of masked separatists held back unattended servants, threw along and powder paint and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also clashes later in the day, when police used their staff to keep the fighting down.
For several hours, independence groups shouted "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven" and were met with Unionist demonstrators shouting "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, the local press reported.
The mood remains high in the independence-minded region one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but voter turnout was low, and those opposed to the resolution boycotted the vote in a large way.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year, after police tried to stop holding the vote during violent clashes at polling stations throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped the night of Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer dared to hope that Catalonia could achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy at having been given the opportunity to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although they got a narrow but important victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved into exile or are in detention and are awaiting sentencing for their role in the aftermath of the vote.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on her phone in support of the police and said the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
“There are going to be bigger and bigger tensions,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been waiting for his trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"The nomination as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to move away from the setback in democratic values and the underdog we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house hit by car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
There may have also been a gunshot to the car at some point.
Menga shoots Livingston to win 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
The Livingston upset the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team moved up side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not won in the league this season and will face the leading team Hearts, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will receive a visit to Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, expands their undefeated streak to six games, and head coach Holt has still not been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chance against cash outing
Holt's team was supposed to have been ahead of long before they scored, and their direct playing style created major problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across in front of the goal, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside of the goal, after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's cross-head in front of the goal.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could give the untenable trouble in deadball situations.
And it was under the circumstances that the important goal came.
Rangers made the free kick, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created the play for Menga, who made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At the time, Rangers had dominated the ball possession but struggled to get through the home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unchallenged.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos abdicated a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was fired at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame during another of Livingston's deadweight situations.
There were ongoing deliveries into Livingston's field, but were refused, and two penalty kicks - after Halkett's tackle on substitute Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball - were rejected.
"Fenomenalt" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal effort and strong result for Livingston.
Everyone played fantastic and exceeds the expectations of their upward journey.
Their playing style and squad have remained largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honour has to go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he joined.
There were many heroes.
Leader Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes throughout the match.
The Rangers were not inspired.
They have sometimes been really good under Gerrard, but they played below level.
Their endings lacked sharpness – only once they’ve been exposed to the home team – and it’s a big wake-up call for Rangers, which is in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
There was a smile and blue sky on Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
There has been disagreement on areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's approach to the EU.
Erdogan then took to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police held for security reasons a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but crowds of supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents – many of them Kurdish – also made themselves known and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to accept the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero by some German Turks and ridiculed as an autocrat by others.
Accident on the way to Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwest part of the city around 10.15 a.m. BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were rescuers on the spot, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver fled the scene, on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said police officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roadblocks have been set up, bus routes have been rerouted, and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in unrest
Six prison officers have been injured in a high-security prison, according to the Prison Office.
There was a disturbance in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9.30 a.m. on Sunday, and the unrest is still ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officer is brought in to handle the riots involving eight inmates and takes place in one flight of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on site.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff are committed to dealing with the ongoing unrest in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those responsible are being reported to the police and may end up spending more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was treated at the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October of last year, a police officer was called to the prison to deal with serious unrest, where employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm surges (dry areas may benefit)
It’s rare that a tropical low pressure hits Arizona, but it’s most likely at the beginning of next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape in the southwestern United States and pose a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued storm flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route across Phoenix on Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had maintained status as tropical storms or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated amounts up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas in the southwestern desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin will likely get 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those at risk of flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will benefit because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.<0x3C>/seg>
According to the U.S. drought monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second-highest category,” reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to hit land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.<0x3C>/seg>
Rosa still has hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum wind strength of 38 m/s and is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore drops in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical power Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain over parts of Mexico can become severe and pose a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 76 to 152 mm of precipitation is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“The primary expected danger from Rosa or the remnants of it is very heavy rain in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert area of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center reported.
The rain is expected to create life-threatening storm surges and liquid rainfall in deserts as well as landslides in mountain terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where his condition was reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The police officer has called on anyone who may have mobile recordings of the incidents to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh was under the Democratic Party's "evil and angry"
“A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the reckless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at an election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been exposed to the “evil, anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and strongly denied and emotionally charged accusations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually abused her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also issued a witness statement at the hearing on his charges.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" at Kavanaugh's that day.
“A vote of confirmation by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service,” he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republicans meeting up at polling stations at midterm elections.
“In five weeks is one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
You can’t vote for me, but you actually vote for me,” he said.
“That’s why I’m traveling around and fighting for amazing candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to “fight and block.”
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a person high in the Republican Party has told CNN.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll rises
At least 384 were killed, and many of them were washed away by huge waves hitting the beach when a major earthquake and a major tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at dusk time, sucked many in death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami came after an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the judges’ scale.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still engaged in activities on the beach. They did not immediately run and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster preparedness BNPB, said during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, the dragged cars, timbers, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
More people managed to survive by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The disaster preparedness committee has published aerial photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Board of Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released during Friday’s major earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, the board said.
Nugroho described the damage as “comprehensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been damaged and 29 reported missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the 300 km coastline north of Palu, the Donggala area closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“There are over 300,000 people living here,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The board was criticised from many fronts on Saturday for not disclosing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the waves had come within the time the warning was sent.
In amateur recordings shared on social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting warnings about the approaching tsunami to the people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with emergency assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities report, but there is still a severe need for food and basic necessities among the evacuated.
The city’s airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is more than 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have safely arrived in Palu city, where employees seek shelter during presentations set up in the courtyard of their account. They came across areas of extensive destruction on the road, Doseba said.
“They told me that they had destroyed so many houses,” he said.
It's really bad.
Even as aid organizations began to work hard to re-establish relief work, there were complaints that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial support, supplies and staff from abroad must only come in if the area where the accident occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial-level disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘OK, it’s a national disaster,’ we can open up for international assistance, but there’s no status yet.”
On the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people held onto the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that illuminate the dark stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled up by a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
“As a veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told how in the hours, after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were part of the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, only resulted in one gray flue leg instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he says.
Twenty takes 26,750 USD while filling the ATM in Newport on the Levee
Twenty stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a press release from Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, crime assistant Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While busy, another man ran "back at Brink's employee" and stole a bag money that was supposed to have been delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the identity of the thieves is kindly requested to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, where he wrote: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces songs Ariana Grande on the show, which canceled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has switched between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported preferring the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West’s former partners, JAY-Z, has also switched between small and large letters and changed whether the binding line is included.
Mexico’s AMLO says it will not use military force against civilians
Mexico’s newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military power against civilians as the country approaches its 50th anniversary for a bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Troopers shot at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 at a time when left-wing student movements rocked many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly state grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. Should Double the Funding of Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, said investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have issued statements about artificial intelligence. However, the U.S. still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take the first place in innovation within artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind compared to the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Double the budget could double the chances of the next major achievement in artificial intelligence being achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent companies in the field of artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranking American Othello player, and later became head of Microsoft Research and director of Google’s China department.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions supported by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge, held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would come to identify the next visionaries.
Scientists in the U.S. often have to work hard to get legatees from the government, Lee says.
"It's not China that's sniffing the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that PhDs in artificial intelligence should automatically have offered work permits.
China’s Council of State issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation delivers funding to people at academic institutions in a manner similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations’ allocation of money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the founding of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
However, U.S. legislation, which is trying to establish a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has stood still for several months.
Macedonians hold a vote to change the country’s name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempts to gain membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of their neighbouring country to the north is a requirement on Greek territory, and has therefore used their veto when Macedonia has applied for accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's primarily Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the vote and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the voter turnout will be the 50% required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot read: “Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to create access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the outcome of the vote and make it happen.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said that no irregularities had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the vote in Macedonia on a change of the country's name, which would open for NATO and EU membership, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and pulled chairs in front of tents set up by those who want to boycott the vote.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to achieve membership with raised foundations, not at the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would provide a much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority will vote for it because over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that a “yes” outcome would be a “secure of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote – less than the required voter turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of those polled planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the turnout must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the pro-democracy government since it took office in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero fights through the entire Brighton defence and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2-0 victory Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his score coming after 65 minutes.
The Argentine striker received a delivery on the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran past three Brighton defenders before swinging out on the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He fought past one defender, and subsequently ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a delivery to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the field to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to top Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the immediate lead in the Premier League game.
The goal came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received in that sequence the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice delivery along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of touches before leading Sterling to the farthest pole.
The Sky Blues forward punctuated the ball in the net, just before it slipped past the goal.
City will compete against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12.55pm on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will drill Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn’t have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still a chance to participate in playoffs for the Rockies, who have played a game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies held at least one wild-card spot with a 5-2 victory over Nationals Friday night, but still have their first division title for good.
“Although we have nothing to play for, we can go to the game knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver and that the opponents would play at the highest level I’m going to face this year.
Why shouldn’t I be excited to play in those conditions?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting line-up for Sunday, but will likely put Scherzer in as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the pitch for the 34th time, trained his pitch Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is normally his rest day.
The right-hander from Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holding election meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republicans meeting at polling stations at midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It’s one of the big, big ones – you can’t vote for me, but you actually vote for me, which is why I travel around and fight for amazing candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power with all available means, and you can see how vicious, how repulsive they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we don't want to give them that."
The Democrats, he said, have as their mission "combat and block".
“And you’ve seen it over the past four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil and evil and disgusting and lying.”
He mentioned the Supreme Democratic Senator in the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, which triggered the loud boom from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, oh no, wait—it was really bad body language—the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer a political party.
They are intolerant of those who express their views.
When Momentum’s activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn’t really a surprise.
I am only the latest in a wide range of Members of Parliament from Labour who have been told that we are not welcome – just because we have made our opinion known.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she took a strong stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship action went to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically similar problems, which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders in.
The invitation to the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
For most of my eight years as a local Member of Parliament, the meetings on Friday evening have just been like this.
Today, the tone of many meetings is unfortunately not so, and the law of "friendly, gentler" politics is far back in the past if it ever got started.
It has become more and more clear that divergent views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed against whether the leadership of the party can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader when colleagues, whom I previously thought I shared a political position with, began to expect that I would make a U-turn and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed to – whether it was national security or the EU’s internal market.
When I say my opinion in public - and it really doesn't matter what I say - a long string of rude messages on social media that call for abstention and opposition to the policy of mediation and tell me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have deep respect for the professionalism and the will to fight of my colleagues, who are overwhelmed with sexism or racism every day, but are still struggling.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour would create a tolerant culture.
But in reality, it is no longer a spacious organization and with every vote of no confidence or change of election rules, the party becomes narrower.
I have received a lot of advice over the last two years that if I lay low on myself and are not so loud, then I have to “get it right”.
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Since becoming a member of Labour 32 years ago when I went to school, I was provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which had left our classroom in a state of decay, and I set out to create better public services for those who need it most – whether as a council member or minister.
I have never hidden my politics, even during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would like to say that when the country turns against Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no form of threat of disqualification or political suitability will deter me from acting on what I believe is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr becomes top team
Two late scores may have got the final result to draw a not entirely truthful picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this amazingly entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their better exploitation of the chance that carried the home team home, and coach Peter Murchie was absolutely entitled to be satisfied.
“Our games have been demanding so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Respect Ayr, they took advantage of their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's scoring after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr forward, but a yellow card to Scottish national team player Rory Hughes, who was awarded for the Warriors match, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a scoring that was not followed up.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before the half-doctor, scoring and then getting a solo score, so there was 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's scoring, which was followed up by a kick from Baggot, reduced the point difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried out of the field on stretchers. When the game was resumed, Ayr expanded with a score from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Working Ayr-leader Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card, and again Melrose took advantage of their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without a follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the future Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick within the poles and followed up with a more almost straight after, the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's box kick and sent winger Gregor Henry away for the fifth home run scoring.
Still Game star looking for a new career in the restoration industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to be taking the step of the restaurant industry after it emerged that he has taken the post of CEO of an authorized restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main character along with his partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' finale, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source suggested to the Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia hopes court will reopen route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the headquarters of the fleet, which is encased in rigs, in La Paz.
On public buildings there is a sea-blue flag.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overpainted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it's a right.
It’s a duty to take it back.”
Throughout the country, Bolivia is reminded of a stretch of coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict over resources, still strong, and the same is the longing to sail on the Pacific Ocean again.
The hopes are perhaps at their highest for decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a judgment from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of voting.
“Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and of course awaits with a positive look at the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the court in The Hague will give Bolivia concurrence that, after decades of discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president, faces a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot at stake at the sentencing on Monday.
“We are close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised last August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will take Bolivia’s party – and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The UN General Assembly, which is based in the Netherlands, has no power to transcend Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice is ruling only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia’s case, the last four years may have given back.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ military rhetoric has done it away with the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was abnormally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years of disagreements and gain benefits for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear weapons unless they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm their nuclear weapons if they can’t trust Washington first.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to abide by promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments were made in the wake of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemingly facing a restart of the locked-in nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "desire dream" to continue sanctions and the U.S. resistance to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to declare, as long as Pyongyang has not taken significant steps towards disarmament at first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump will have one more summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about abolishing an arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collections with big headwear that you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted on the catwalk disguised for a collection of remarkable headwear in extra large size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino’s most impressive work was a sumptuous one with a remote-like broad shadow covering the heads of the models.
There were also other extra-large accessories, including watermelons with jewelry and even an pineapple – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had composite lips that resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving gear with snorkel and mask, and others resembled a melted waffle.
And if you continue the big fashion statements, you're lucky.
Style watchers predict that the huge hats could come to stores near you.
The giant hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60-centimeter-wide shadow that is seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly impractical hatred that was spread across social media has sent a new great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as big as the model that shows it.
The orange bast bag with bast fringes and a white leather handle was the most striking in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in regular stores next summer. The designer has had such a big influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories of huge size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have many great academic results behind them, and it continues in 2018 with yet another series of outstanding exam results, which are further enhanced by individual and collective success in the field of sport, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
The independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can compose and implement a tailored curriculum, we experience that modern languages remain a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it hits your heart.”
It is an important reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can look at the latest exam results this year, that language is the highest in the statistics with the most passed exams in the independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received the high grade A.
The data collected by SCIS' 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students received grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now perceived as a choice of subjects at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools of thought and elsewhere.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that, among the reasons that employers were unable to occupy vacancies, 17% had to do with language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important in relation to preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career young people choose, if they have learned a different language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this one.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a lead to the competitors.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
When you can speak multiple languages, especially languages from developing countries, you give children a better chance to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, there is a difference between schools in which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future offers.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be truly important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and that must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this award to Scotland’s youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron makes his debut for Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James is playing in Sunday's opening game before the season starts against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It doesn’t matter how many minutes he plays.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James most likely will not play the entire game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in relation to the Lakers' planned six games before the start of the season.
“Where I am in my career, I don’t have to fight until the start of the season to get ready,” he said.
Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a string of election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five scheduled election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm Trump’s appointed judge to the vacant seat at the Supreme Court is suspended, Trump is trying to back up the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump’s election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump’s election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held at midnight (Denmark time) on the night between Saturday, November 29th and Sunday, November 30th, 2018.
You can watch Trump's election in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court. The hearings were strained due to allegations of sexual misconduct, and the expected Senate vote on confirmation is suspended for a week while the FBI is investigating the charges.
But the primary goal of this strip of voter turnout is to create momentum for the Republicans facing a tough election in November.
People from President Trump’s campaign team said the five election meetings next week are aimed at “creating energy among volunteers and supporting when Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible, now that we are entering the busy campaign period,” a Trump campaign spokesman who would not be named said.
The evening’s election meeting will be held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to troop up to give him a boost in polls," said Simon Haeder, who is engaged in political science at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown a fighting spirit and tries to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles duos
After three one-sided rounds, Saturday’s four-man duels were perhaps what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pad is a completely invented sports concept, but a concept that players believe in – not least in competitions like this one.
Where would they say there is momentum now?
"They led by six points, and now there are four, so we're probably seeing it as a bit of a momentum," Jordan Spieth said before he held the quarterfinals.
Of course Europe has the advantage. They are 4 points ahead and there are 12 points more to play for.
However, as Spieth says, the Americans feel that they have a bit of wind in their sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast three points out of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The high cheers grew higher as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important pit that secured victory in duel four, although he and Thomas had been two strokes behind after two duels.
His put that secured them the fight on hole 15 was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows he doesn’t think the American team is out of the competition yet.
“You just have to find the inner strength and focus on your own struggle,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, without a doubt the biggest Ryder Cup story.
Europe’s strange but sympathetic couples have scored four points in four games, and appear flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy seemingly flows on both to and from the wild audience, shows that it is those that will be hardest to beat Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory is overshadowed by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Anywhere synchronous on each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a brief trial against Sergio Garcia, the morning of the four-man duels, when he formed a pair with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swedes into a hole they were never close to getting out.
On Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The matches with four balls and two teams a two players are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way the strategy can quickly change.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-man duos have also shown that Team USA has the fighting spirit that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 ahead of last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a big advantage before the last day of the Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the US of 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a troubled Tiger Woods and have so far received four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's European team, trying to win the cup they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an inaccurate American team in the morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. put up more resistance in foursomes, won four games, but was still behind.
Jim Furyk’s team will need eight points in Sunday’s 12 singles game if they are to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to have won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have been nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the only other pair in Ryder Cup history to have won four points in their first four games.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a reluctant Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who struggled through the first two games on Saturday, had little geniuses looking, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning's fourballs and returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and won a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who is number three in the world.
Europe, however, has it quite as they want it, on a slightly winding day southwest of Paris.
Triple major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being behind with four points before the singles matches. However, since Furyks currently has the cup, they only have to achieve indecisive to keep it.
After being second best for two days, however, it looks like they can’t master a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will not retaliate unilaterally if there is no confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions are intensifying their distrust of the United States and that the country will not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s General Assembly that North Korea had shown “significant goodwill” within the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, decommissioning an area for nuclear tests and promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We have not seen a similar reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will take the first step and unilaterally degrade ourselves.”
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. But his speech seemed important as it did not unequivocally reject unilateral disarmament, as it has otherwise been the case from P.
Ri referred to a joint statement from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work "nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has demanded a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance to softening up for scrapping international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first’ and expands the pressure of sanctions to achieve their purpose by force and even opposes the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a wishful thinking among people who don’t know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions reinforce our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in within the past five months and added: "If nuclear equipment were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so closed."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea’s missiles at the American mainland was inevitable, after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened at the United Nations with “total destruction” of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for defying disarmament, but said there is still much to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea collapses.
Trump said Wednesday that he did not have a schedule for these actions, but said "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council must uphold the sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear weapons program.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines at the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, while North Korea only hours later accused him of making “gang-like demands.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile facility as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "similar steps."
He said that Kim had told him that the "similar steps" he demanded were the security pledges Trump made in Singapore, as well as moves towards a normalization of the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course on getting enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all undergraduate students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture, where you study all night long held up by large amounts of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the world’s best university often do not know the first thing about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, who is a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which, he believes, is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after holding a presentation on the effects of lack of sleep on learning.
“When the show was over, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why do I have to know this first when I’m on the candidate?’
“She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains how good sleep habits can improve one’s academic and sporting performance as well as one’s overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, who is a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of the university’s health area, says the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course consists of, among other things, various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises there is a picture of a college room where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how one’s athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and how important good sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on various icons on an interactive map of campus.
“We know it won’t change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect your health,” adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride in taking an “allnighter” still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students has led to sleep deprivation being a growing problem.
The “secret weapon” against stress, exhaustion and anxiety is good and adequate sleep, he said – it counteracts even weight gain because lack of sleep makes the brain think that you’re hungry, why they’re constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, last year helped Professor Czeisler organize the course when he took one of his courses on his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and made him work on making it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next thing will be that all graduates are offered a similar course before continuing their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm so they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of light from electronic screens, which can move at the circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals from Menga lowers Gerrard and co.
Rangers suffered another defeat on the field, as Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's inconsistent team had to take a 1–0 defeat in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was out after their first win on the field since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard the second defeat in 18 games as a coach, thus there are eight points up to Hearts in the first place of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga beat to seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not answer back to.
Rangers now smokes down to a sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to a third place after Hibernian with only the goal score in difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, as line judges Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by a thrown object that seemed to come from the outfield section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the lineup that reached the Betfed Cup semi-finals by toning past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, stood with the same 11 who shaved a point of Hearts' lead last week, and he would have been delighted to see his sharp team exhaust the opponents throughout the course.
Rangers had the ball the most, but Livingston was more efficient.
They should have scored two minutes in the game, when Menga's first-ever broadcast sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempt was over.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found its way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow kicked past the backmost pole.
The Rangers took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attacking game.
Alfredo Morales was not satisfied, at least, when Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's appeals for a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless brought together after a quarter game.
Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's empty shot.
Although Liv's opening in the 34th minute was somewhat coincidental, it must be said to be deserving of their efforts alone.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle a deadball situation in depth from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga who could easily kick it in goal.
During the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave way when the winger sent the ball in to Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the odds to play on their premise with many long balls up the field from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team could have extended the lead in the final part of the match, but McGregor safely rejected Jacobs before Lithgow headed next to goals.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton again appealed for a late penalty kick after being ousted along with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked the other way here.
Yearbook: The inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we count... – was the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become a fixed component of both science and popular culture, as it could be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had the lead roles as Bond scientists:
Man: "What in the world is it?"
Rogers: “It’s a geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you touch these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals makes.”
Evans: "Stop it, now it's time for it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are injected again.
A test vaccine works promisingly in patients with a variety of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which has many cancers, and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “makes several cancers develop,” including breast, ovary, lung and intestinal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, in which one takes immune cells out of patients and "teaches" them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West held Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
After an incoherent performance in the Saturday Night Live study, Kanye West was ousted when he hailed U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
When he had played the third song of the evening Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again casket, he began a thunderstorm against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
“I talk so often to white people who say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
But if I worried about racism, I would have long since moved out of the United States,” he said.
The SNL began the evening's show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Although the footage was not shown, comedian Chris Rock Wests uploaded the tirade on social media.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to expose West by uploading the footage.
West also complained to the public about poor treatment backstage due to its headwear.
“They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And they said I was sunk deep,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how deep I've sunk?", saying that he would take on his Superman cap because it means that "You can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try it with love.”
The audience boasted at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff admitted to being embarrassingly affected, Variety says with a comment from a person who was present: "There was a buzz in the studio."
West had been booked as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose then-girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing with the song I Love It while he was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR NOT LETTING YOU OUT OF THE PEOPLE."
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West just "is who he is, and it's just fine."
“But I do NOT choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his ‘art’), who embraces and issues an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And we have that too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he had taken the name change to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and therefore follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg has been nicknamed Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Accusations of attempted murder after stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.

The defendants are expected to be brought before the Belfast Court of Appeals on Monday.
The proceedings shall be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington longs out after toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor goes after the stereotypical macho hero and says that this kind of TV character means that young men often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit told the Sunday Times Culture that he believes that something has been "gone wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem lies with him "very much in mind".
“At the moment, I’m very much into it – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?” he said.
“If we look at the current problems, what have we taught young men in their upbringing?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is applied?
What is it that young men learn from television and on the street that makes them feel like they have to be men in this way?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
For it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men.”
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not make sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
Kit takes part from November in a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best in the entire Game of Thrones experience.
“I met my wife because of this series, so that’s how it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has posted a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, health officials say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were recorded.
By far the majority of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people getting HIV in this way has been reduced to something close to zero, Chinese health authorities say at a conference in Yunnan province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry sooner or later with women because of the country’s conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to the lack of use of prevention in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaking data on Republican senators and condemns “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
A member of the House of Representatives Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims stemmed from websites and support from the “extreme right wing.”
“Lies, lies, and more terrible lies,” Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
The information allegedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill. It occurred during a hearing in the Senate regarding allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages such as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses pointed out that the information had been posted by the Waters people, after which they published information about a member of the Waters staff.
“This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie,” Waters continued.
The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
“It suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a congressman.
If you are accused of something you have not done, you must not be angry.
You don't have to be stubborn.
One must not question the motives of the accused.
You have to keep your mind calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate aiming to take Waters' place in the midterm elections, also announced his opinion on Twitter.
“Great, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In Waters’ official statement, she said her staff had contacted “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities regarding these fraudulent claims.”
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are found,” she continued. “And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and everyone in my staff.”
Johnny English review strikes again – entertaining spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British cast, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will the bold, sarcastic self-satisfaction of how much it is with us become the country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber eye and the big eyes has been given his permission to make loudspeakers again and again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comic find aimed at places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is, of course, the muted secret agent, who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a bit of Clouseau, a knife tip Mr. Bean, and properly climbed by him, who performed a single tone to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the world-wide and international loophole that left chaos in his wake, after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are some good moments in this recent shot at the tribe from JE.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson’s talent for physical comics, but the humor feels pretty subversive and strangely superfluous, especially now that more “serious” film series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer compelling comics as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English’s crazy adventure isn’t as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film floppies in the role of Mr. Bean.
The inexhaustible starting point of the film is that the UK is in serious trouble.
An internet hacker has infiltrated England’s top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field of terror for the responsible agent – a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a pompous and combative prime minister who is already suffering a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the script.
As her security advisors inform her that every active spy has been revealed, she is forced to cancel someone’s pension.
And, of course, it's the clumsy Johnny English, who is now a school inspector at an upper-class school, but who secretly teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some funny sequences here when English stands for some kind of School of Rock training in espionage.
English rushes back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunites with his hard-fought former right hand Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an over-enthusiastic but well-meaning submarine captain – a role played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the royal intelligence agency’s huge Batman and Robin are back when they meet Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is staggeringly close to being immigrated by charismatic and fearsome tech billionaire Jason Volta – played by Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England’s computer problems.
English and Bough start their frenzy-filled escapades: disguised as servants, they set fire to an ancient French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta’s luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to get acquainted with Volta’s house.
All the cannons are fired off in the final sequence of the film, but no matter how well-meaning and energetic it is, there is a sense of children’s television over it.
Quite mediocre.
And as I couldn’t help but think about the other Johnny English films: Can’t the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour refuses to barge on plan for four-day work week with unchanged pay for the British
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour is said to consider a radical plan so that the English can be satisfied with a four-day work week, but get paid for five.
The party will reportedly have business leaders to use their artificial intelligence (AI) savings to give employees an extra day off.
That would mean that the employees would have a three-day weekend without going down to pay.
Sources say the idea would align with the party’s economic goal of pulling the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party told The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year."
“It’s not going to happen in a day, but a four-day work week is a goal that fits with the party’s approach to changing the economy to the workers’ benefit and to the party’s overall strategy for industry.”
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea as the Green Party proposed a four-day work week during the 2017 parliamentary election.
However, the objective is not supported unanimously by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour shadow finance minister John McDonnell used last week's party meeting to record his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he is determined to regain power from “anonymous directors” and “exploiters” in supply companies.
The Shadow Finance Minister's plans also raise doubts as to whether the current shareholders of water supply companies will be able to recover their money as a government headed by Labour could "motivate" them on the basis of immoral actions.
He also confirmed plans to get workers on corporate boards and set up including equity funds, which are to allocate 10 percent of private enterprise stock value to employees who stand to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy Tell 60 Minutes if FBI Investigation of Kavanaugh Could Change Their Voice
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week. And it raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could get the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig something out that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy allowed himself to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came out – and said, “Did you do it?”
He was steel-set, determined and unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, on the other hand, appears to be carved in stone.
“I have made a decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh, and another would require a very violent accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know that Brett strongly denied it,” Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of them she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can’t see that it would change anything.”
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive range of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizens Festival will receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park’s large lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will draw attention to the real goal of ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival was launched in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organization that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do volunteer work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or other meaningful action that can bring attention to a subject matter
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that they have 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert create real change, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” – that is, people feel that they make a difference by signing up for a subscription online or making a Twitter post?
Global Citizen states that since 2011 they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their members aimed at different goals.
They believe that these actions have spurred world leaders to make binding goals and policy actions equivalent to more than $37 billion, which by 2030 is expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 goals and actions that had become due to their actions, which ran up to over $10 billion, which had already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main goals is The Power of Nutrition, which was started in England and is a collaboration between investors and strong people. They strive to "help children live up to their full potential" and promise $35 million to fix nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citient.
“With the help of the English government, donors, governments of other countries, and world citizens like you, the social injustice of malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books,” Tracey Ullman, the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK government has now pledged funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 online calls. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutrition advice.
In response to one of the website’s frequently asked questions, which read: “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen wrote: “It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But as with the civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because we are stronger together.”
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the performers at this year’s festival in New York.
U.S. can use its fleet to “block” Russian energy exports, says U.S. Home Secretary
“If necessary,” Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, even in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext to expand the sale of its energy.
“I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
“The U.S. has the ability with our fleet to ensure that there are free passages on the seas, and if necessary, we can also block them so that we ensure their energy does not come on the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that views itself as “the voice of the American energy consumer.”
He compared Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are basically the same.
“The economic opportunities with respect to Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick pony” whose economy relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed to increase European exports of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration spokespersons, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said has made Berlin “captured” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion expensive Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is solely an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and is simply due to economic considerations.
“I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool to exert pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose a supplier,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the BDI, has asked the United States to intervene outside the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party interfering in our energy supplies," BDI leader Dieter Kempf said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" running for president after the midterm election, she said on Saturday.
During a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering resigning.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will be seriously considering running for president.”
Warren expressed his opinion about President Donald Trump during the city council and said he "leads the country in the wrong direction."
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been voiced in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, “Of course the FBI will have to investigate the matter before the vote.”
A poll on Thursday, however, shows that the majority of Warren’s own backcountry does not believe she will stand up in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not run.
32% supported the possible candidature.
The opinion poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick with 38% for and 48% against a possible set-up.
Other high-profile Democratic candidates discussed in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will announce his final decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Names Track Palin’s PTSD at Donald Trump Voter’s Meeting
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through after he’s come home, makes me able to relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers return home with,” she told the audience at a Trump election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become harder. They go and think about whether there is respect for what their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, to prevent the reporting of domestic violence and to be in possession of a weapon in a drunken state, said Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Wasilla police.
18 states and D.C. support resistance to new asylum law
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new U.S. law that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. on Friday issued a party-independent statement in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions trial, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal law, has not been published.
She says her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of U.S. asylum seekers come, as countries with far-reaching problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum law overturned a decision made by the U.S. Aliens’ Office in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new law "removes from decades of state, federal, and international law."
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle goes against that principle," the party-dependent statement said.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law on rejecting immigrants harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become self-employed and "provide the necessary labor force."
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions’ immigration judges waived the right to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political status,” Sessions said in a statement.
It has never been intended that asylum should remedy all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people around the world face every day.
As death toll doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu become desperate
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
“It’s very exciting,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her little fever-stricken boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with a body.
We lack clean water.”
The residents now returned to their ruined home to sort through blood-soaked properties and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were also hit by the 7.5 earthquake, were unable to attend.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were outside Palus Military Hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to severe aftershocks.
He got tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
“I was crushed against a broken wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was going to a wedding in the city.
“I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Unfair Methods and Propaganda Ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper that drummed up the benefits of a U.S.-Chinese cooperation, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Dailys paid infiltration into the Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best-selling newspaper – after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 congressional election.
U.S. officials say Trump’s accusation of Chinese meddling in the U.S. election marks a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war, where they have repeatedly imposed tariffs on each other’s imported goods.
China’s retaliatory duty in the trade war was to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts say.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, a former governor for a number of years in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said Beijing has hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a leader in Sunday’s Des Moines Register that China “steps up the use of the innocent methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the proud American tradition of freedom of speech and press freedom by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In the kiosks here in Beijing, on the other hand, you will find only a few dissenting voices, and you will not get a justifiable picture of the different attitudes of the Chinese people towards China’s worrying economic direction, as the media is under tight control from the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which one.
Republicans alienate women ahead of midterm election with Kavanaugh case, warns analysts
While many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that they will experience a backlash in the upcoming midterm election, especially from women.
The case has put the feelings in the air, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
“This cannot be done about,” Grant Reher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said he doubts that Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona)'s request for an 11-hour FBI investigation will ease anger among voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday – they don’t forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted during a demonstration in the Senate: "November is coming!" as the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights,” independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the news media.
“People say it’s already reached a high level; it’s true.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters – 18-29-year-olds – who rarely vote, despite not liking the president.”
Even before Ford’s public accusations of the Supreme Court nominee’s sexual assault, analysts had pointed out that it could backfire if the Republicans continued with the nomination.
“It has become a worse mess for Republicans,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said at the start of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final result, or Kavanaugh being held accountable; it’s also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her,” Guy Cecil, president of Priorities USA, a group that supports Democrats in being elected, told the news channel.
But Americans seem to have shared views on who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter has a little more on their side.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents believed Ford’s testimony for sure or likely, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh for sure or likely.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh either likely or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
At the invitation of Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other, writes Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had committed a felony against her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals to a party when they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the internet plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a new company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that Inrupt's plan is "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology so people can make their own “personal online data collection” or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is up to the user to determine who can access the specific information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea of Inrupt is, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, to gather resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the available tools on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don’t talk to “Facebook or Google about whether to completely change it, so all of their business models suddenly become superfluous.”
"We're not asking for your permission."
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet being built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next period of the internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Spiritual recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War I celebrated
The only priest of the English Church who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I is celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Priest Bernard Wann won the order on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never got to know that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said that it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's successful business.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from machine guns and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and led his people forward with the "greatest manpower" before attacking an artillery and unharmed three guns alone.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother James Vann also made a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he "felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people underscores the true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine you’ve been up all night to see the star-studded Bellator 206 and then you’re denied to see the main event.
There were 13 games on the program from San Jose, including six games on the main program, and they were shown overnight in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to meet, the viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission switched to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until early morning for just this match.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke."
"According to the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., why they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president, when asked about the broadcast.
"'Grisen Gurli', yes."
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they will work on counting English viewers in planning ahead.
“When you think about the recast, I think we can make it work,” Coker said.
“But the time is six Sunday mornings up there, and we can’t find a solution to that until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it was changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, and we thought it was a technical error.
In fact, it was the law.
I promise you, it won't happen next time.
We're going to settle for five games instead of six, which we usually do. We tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had “minority” over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt less worthy than anyone else in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that it did not go up for him until he came to the larger classes, that "everyone is not like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that he went less up to win the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The regular host of the long-running radio program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley was a guest on Laverne's first show and said he felt "less worthy" than anyone else in his upbringing, because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said: “Until today, the feelings of feeling worthy and feeling different have been the things that have given me strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they got to know his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medallist has become a highly profiled LGBT fighter and used his participation at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said he had been “surprised” when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
He said it’s hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when going through so much at such a young age – he took to his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it would be all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had received tickets to London 2012 – when he would be at the forefront.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there at the time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first occurred to me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead.”
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of my whole life – diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – that had meant a lot during the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs will run on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m. BST.
Uskarp Mickelson on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he has to do something about the form if it’s not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who sets a record for the 12th time in the competition, which is held every 2 years, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk due to Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of events for the United States as usual, the five-time grand-winner had to act lucky and practice his game in the hope of correcting the sweepstakes.
Not even at the height of his career he had the most straight drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the field at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes wildfire shots.
And if the pitch wasn’t a big enough mouthful, Mickelson will meet at the ninth game on Sunday the always exact winner of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who start the 12 singles games start strong, Mickelson’s fight can be crucial.
Furyk did not express surprise confidence in his teammate.
“He fully understood his role today, gave me a slap on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a great faith in himself.”
He is in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and also this week.
I didn’t think he was going to play two games.
I thought he was going to play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson beat Nick Faldo's record for most played matches in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully matched his individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence contributes with something indefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, he likes to run to people, and he's good to have in the team room," he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He’s contributing a lot more than just the game.”
European captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
European captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows from experience that a solid lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup single count can quickly become nerve-wracking.
The Danish made his debut in Valderrama in 1997, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but was just about to be picked up before the finish line with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 victory.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we just won,” says Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday to a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's supposed to be completely trashed tomorrow.
Go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that’s trying to win the trophy, and that’s where our focus lies.
I’ve always said I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Satisfied with his players’ performance on a difficult track, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: “I don’t take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow is the individual performance that counts, and that’s something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re tested on all the parameters as a golfer.
That’s what players need to understand – get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you must leave your partner, for he will also get the best out of himself.”
It looks different to opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced covengings on the last day, first on the winning team in Brookline, before he lost, when Europe made the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
Once momentum has found a direction, it puts a great deal of pressure on the midfields.
We’re putting our team together in relation to that and putting the players on the pitch in the order we feel. We’re trying to create magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the rebound and facing Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the series.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it ensures us all the way through," Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said of his selection of singles.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy was supposed to have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. But the Germans have to wait at least another year due to technical problems and an escalating price, local media write.
The deployment of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been postponed to the first half of 2019 according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a spokesman from the military.
The ship was supposed to have become part of the fleet in 2014, but compliance problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, are to replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
They are known to have a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature for the latest frigates is a minor need for maintenance: it should be possible to keep the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which reportedly will make Germany appear as an overseas power factor – will already be obsolete when they are deployed, writes Die Zeit.
The failed F125 frigate created headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to take the ship into use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the fleet delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that made the warship useless in combat situations.
Software errors were of particular importance as the ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class were to be managed by a crew of 120 sailors – that is only half of that crew from the older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the fleet's ability for future updates.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware failure, the price of the project, which includes training the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German government's defense committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "runs out of ready-to-deploy ships."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of use without being replaced.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuertemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust sneaks into the secret life of bats
New research from an area in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the funds will shed light on the unique behaviour of flying mammals and will help in the work of future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from the Scottish National Trust and follows common bats, dwarf bats, long-legged bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in carefully selected locations in the area to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
Data are also collected from NTS staff and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of the bat muscles and show what kind of what does.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behavior, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
NTS Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of meadows, and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has dropped dramatically over the past 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect the shipowners and limit their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger. The same can be flue traps, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks from pets.
In fact, the bat is not blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced ecolocalization technique to find insects and fly without any obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts, who often collect data, inspect ships and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has even made Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in the area around Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland's bats.
The area's manager, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a really good area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There’s a lot you don’t know about bats, so working here and elsewhere can help you understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance tasks on properties, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and young people, thereby risking the destruction of an entire local population.
Flags are protected, and it is illegal to kill, harass, or disrupt them or their herds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to lend a hand.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don’t know how populations develop.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, while lawyers sue German magazine <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him for "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the charges.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is alleged that he has paid her $375,000 to keep it a secret, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations had been made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of the accusations they have called “an unforgivable disclosure of suspicions about the privacy sphere.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player would seek compensation for "moral damage in a class similar to the charge, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident reportedly took place in June 2009 at a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to a report filed in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "a good guy 99% of the time" caught by "one percent".
The papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and photographed her injuries at a hospital, but that she later agreed to an agreement outside the courthouse because she felt "fear of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old now says she will overturn the deal as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the event was supposed to have taken place, and this summer switched to the Italian club Juventus for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain ‘will forever regret’ the loss of car manufacturers
Britain “will regret it forever” if it lost its status as the world’s leading carmaker after Brexit, said trade minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily lower production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that longer waiting times at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, with 90% of them exported to the rest of the EU.
“As I see it, production will stop at our factory if the UK smokes out of the EU at the end of March,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Burnaston.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears of leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturers has to do with risks with the supply chain in the event of a no-deal exit.
Toyota’s production runs on a tight schedule, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border, which, according to the car industry, could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of production at the Derbyshire plant, and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is “combined to precisely avoid these border checks.”
“We need to have a deal, we want the best deal that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers point out that we need to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the longer term, higher prices would reduce the factory’s competitiveness, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a trusted partner at the factory, says that his members are becoming more and more concerned: “My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they will not come again.”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “be postponed one more week” as the settlement around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein looks over the shoulder of special prosecutor Robert Mueller during his investigation of Russian election interference, relations between Trump’s aides and Russia and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy justice minister and thereby risk Mueller’s independence has been a gossip in Washington for months.
The New York Times earlier this month wrote that Rosenstein was considering wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president via the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the rumor went that he wanted to resign.
Instead, a meeting was agreed on Thursday with Trump, who at the time was in the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate Judiciary hearing, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who have accused him of sexual assault, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate election.
Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked to meet Rosenstein, she said: “There is no set date. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with everything going on in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I like to always keep the press up-to-date."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press meetings was not due to TV journalists' games for the gallery, but added, "I don't disagree that they're playing up to the camera."
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
“The president takes more questions from the press than any president before him,” she said, adding without citing a source: “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
Press meetings will still take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it’s infinitely much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to give it ample opportunity, and you’ve seen us do it over the last couple of weeks, and it’s going to be in the place of the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump often takes questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press meetings with high-ranking guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why, when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the journalists present.
Health Minister contacts EU staff in Scottish health care after Brexit concerns <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish that they remain after Brexit.
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than half a year before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal are continuing, and it seems that decisions are expected for the autumn.
But the British government has also increased their preparation for a possible Brexit without a deal.
I know it must be a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts that each employee has made, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from outside the EU come with valuable experience and competences that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare to the benefit of patients and the local community.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would very much like you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie gets emergency surgery after head injury
The linebacker from the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was acutely operated after suffering a major injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State First Coach Rod Reed told reporters that the incident took place before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and fell just about out there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him in for further investigation.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center had ended.
Harris added that there are "no details on the type or extent of the damage yet," and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he sustained the damage.
Abercrombie is studying for a second year and is starting his first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him 18 tackles combined this season.
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp duty when buying houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK. The extra money, according to the Conservative Party, should help the homeless.
This move will dampen Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp duty will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects that it will provide <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to the homeless.
Theresa May will propose today that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, for the benefit of the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and going after them with the highest income.
The increase in the stamp duty will affect people and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK. The income from this must be used for the government's struggle to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional charge, which is set above the current stamp duty and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and leases, can reach up to 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by people living abroad, making prices rise and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "spooky towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the stamp duty to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused major construction and construction companies of keeping property prices up by buying reasons they did not use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap homes to solve Britain’s “shameful housing situation.”
Corbyn has proposed an eye-catching range of housing reforms, including controlling house prices and removing the landlord’s ability to put people on the street if they comply with the lease.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing.
May said: “Last year I said I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life is getting better for each generation.
And that means repairing our non-working housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be the case that it is as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy housing as it is for hard-working Britons.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the unworthiness of sleeping on the street is still too widespread.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to become Scotland’s coach”
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his “ultimate goal” is at some point to become Scotland’s coach.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from North East, which now holds third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after looking back at St Mirren in the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B team, and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland on Hampden with my father when I was a kid, and that has always attracted me.
That option would only arise if I succeed in training clubs.”
Ross' predecessors as coach of Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he had no concerns about following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success based on whether 'I can get this club back in the Premier League.'
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'll probably only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years into his career as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa come back after being relegated to third place and transformed St Mirren from the threat of relegation to the title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more suited now than he ever did during his career as a player for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real divorce," he recalls of the time in Alloa.
“I honestly thought that the coaching team was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds weird because I did it well, made sense and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are many things you need to do on a weekly basis.
There is still the kind of stress and pressure that trains, but it just feels right.
I’ve always wanted to train, and now I do. I haven’t been more comfortable with myself in my entire adult life.”
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30th on Radio Scotland between 12.00 and 13.00 BST.
The best time for a beer is Saturdays at 5:30 p.m.
The heatwave this summer has increased earnings for England’s pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales of pubs and bars rose 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants have fallen 4.8%, figures show.
Peter Martin, CGA’s corporate consultant, said: “Continued sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long World Cup have meant that July follows the June pattern, where pubs experienced more sales of 2.8%, except that restaurants are harder hit now.
The drop of 1.8% in restaurants in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on the sale of beverages clearly managed best and experienced progress similar to the decline of restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food led in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just want something to drink.
Across pub and bar chains, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% per month, while food fell by 3.3%.
Paul Newman, who analyses the service industry, said: “The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the out-of-home market, weather and major social or sports events are the biggest factors.
It’s no surprise that restaurants are still struggling, even though a 4.8% year-on-year fall in sales will really hurt above rising costs.
The long, hot summer couldn’t come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide a hard-needed respite.”
The total increase in sales totaled for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7% in July, which shows the decline in newly launched brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales figures for English pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and they are leading in the field.
One in five children have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – all under the age of 11 – have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a study.
A study of 20,000 students in grades 4-9 reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has raised fears of sexual content being posted.
20% of students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents
One in five children under the age of 11 create accounts on social media that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 students from 4th grade and out reveals violent growth in “false Insta” accounts – a reference to the image sharing service Instagram.
The news has raised fears of sexual content being posted.
20% of students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents, while they also have private ones.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account saw a teenager calling on others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools, found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of whom admitted to having private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: “It’s scary that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of the athletes” on the board of directors of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics at the governing body’s annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful athlete, and President Ian Bettie described the shift as a good opportunity for those who make decisions about sports to benefit from her great 10-year experience at the international level.
"Eilidh enjoys great prestige in the athletic world in Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world, and we are confident that the athletics in Scotland will be able to benefit from getting her on board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I will try to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help to highlight a direction for sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and who is now often a commentator for the BBC, could not go after a transient ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “A month ago I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time would show if I would get on top of it and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’m fast, have learned to walk again and are doing agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Advertising for breast pump that compares mothers with cows gets mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared the opinions online with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers with cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump,” the tech consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music video-inspired advertisement that must show the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a basket filled with hay, to a song in which it reads: "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail" and "If you hadn't noticed it, it's not weeds, it's my breasts."
“Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my child, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my barm.”
But the advertisement, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has led to controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reception from viewers. Many say that it laughs at the “fearers” of the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
“Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth.”

Another wrote: “Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise for a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their children?”
Another added: "What an insensitive advertisement."
One woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny."
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would have had one.
Breastfeeding made me feel just like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” one wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun advertising aimed at mothers who pump milk (often in their workplace or in toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind advertising is based on the fact that many women who breastfeed say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no pipes or hoses and fits discreetly in a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their children and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and director of Mother, wrote: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while in an entertaining and recognisable way we showed the freedom that the new pump can provide."
It's not the first time that Elvie's pump has created headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to tents at Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has exploded, although the number of border guards has not changed. This is partly due to a harsher rhetoric and the Trump administration’s scrapping laws, which make it harder to place children at sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared for their ability to stay in the country by standing up and accepting a child.
The risk of homelessness rose in June, when authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would give fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress and said they had arrested several people who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had clean criminal records.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors’ households are staying illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still chasing those people," Albence said.
In an attempt to deal with children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention. Before that, it was within 60 days, say aid workers.
Many people use video calls instead of even meeting up and speaking their case for lawful stay to an immigration judge.
Those who are convicted of being ineligible for residence are deported quickly.
The longer children stay in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcomes or attempts to escape, according to aid workers and in reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People who advocate for better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to keep track of whether a child is suffering.
They added that moving to a tent village without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can build up traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria announces U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
When Syria’s foreign minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country’s war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces' stay in the country is illegal and under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and they will "be met with similar means."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror "is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and several million have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this decisive war until we have cleared all Syrian territories” for both terror groups and “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
In the refugee field, Moualem said the conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unfounded fear" that caused the refugees to flee.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate these repatriations,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the EU have warned that no aid will be made available to rebuild the country before there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Due to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Syrian forces backed by Russia against the province where three million people live was avoided.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would follow jihadists from the Nusra Front, a group of al-Qaeda originators who "will be exterminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon for the first meetings of the new committee to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for an election.
Moualem has put conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and says the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the legislation of the current constitution", warning against interference.
Trump wins another presidential term.
From that logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020, unless the trial and scandals end his presidency ahead of time, which many liberal viewers are probably hoping for.
In what is undoubtedly going to be "The most dramatic end to a presidential term ever!"
Currently, there are no signs of visual fatigue.
Since 2014, viewership figures for the best broadcast time have nearly doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best broadcast time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show has the most viewers with up to 3.5 million on nights with big news.
“It’s a spectacle that people get attracted to because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, who leads the ABC drama Designated Survivor about a head of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he wanted to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell said.
Chaos has entertainment value.
But unlike all other TV shows, the stories coming from Washington can determine the case between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged.
And yet it’s about more than being an enlightened citizen when you see a six-hour panel debate in which experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background” when he wrote his book “Fear”; Paul Manafort’s 15,000-dollar strawberry jacket (“clothed with hybris,” wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of the Trumps.
I never want to see Super Mario in the same way.
“One of the things that makes it feel like a reality show is that it gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump’s rotating crew and daily surprises (scanners with N.F.R.)
But if you miss a paragraph, you're off.
When I caught Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC while he was filming CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was to be decided.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows before, and people said, ‘That’s the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Big summer finds way to the close mid-term elections to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania receives large sums of money. As a result of an equation of two "Congressional Districts", two members of Congress fight for the same seat.
This newly-recovered suburban district of Pittsburg is causing trouble for Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a second special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another sitting congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania’s 12th district, which far surpasses the new 17.
The cards were remade after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district was unlawfully set up in favor of the Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th district has started a struggle for financial resources between the major party committees, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a high-stakes election in March's special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been in the hands of Republicans for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give Democrats a small advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for aid to China, but re-determined
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw Trump’s leadership out.
Foreign Ministry officials decided to call leading U.S. diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador that was punished. They received approximately $140 million from the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a summit on security and economic development, which should have continued last year's meeting, which was considered to be a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, thus dropping the considerations about punishment for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will speak to the conference scheduled for mid-October to send a signal about the importance that Americans place in the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new harsh demands or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the case, which was described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about the internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the basis of a condition of anonymity.
Know the history
The next obstacle could very well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of the investigation, which is considerable and publicly available evidence for.
Mueller will also direct his investigation into the question of whether Trump’s campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the election.
If Congress were to come up with new hands, Trump will likely be held accountable as he prepares to meet the voters again and, of course, a jury of his peers over time.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump is ultimately inevitable – and so are his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to initiate a coup against Hitler if only the West could resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the year-long bloodbath afterwards.
It is around such turning points that the axis of history rotates, and the indisputable march of democracy begins or decreases.
In the United States, we now face several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller’s investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been warm since this newspaper was able to announce that last year he had proposed to make covert recordings of the president and challenged his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is inaccurate.
“How do we react if the FBI’s recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is halted or not properly conducted – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, more importantly, until midterm elections, will we vote for a congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the homeland of my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath lights on the table with the garden cross.

Rangers’ Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the fight against SK Rapid Wien
Rangers take on SK Rapid Wien on Thursday. After the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, they will have good chances to move on from Group G of the Europa League with a win against the Austrians.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his season debut before the 2-2 game against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the game with the belief that we could get something home and we got a point.
Maybe we could have taken the stick home, but overall it was quite a reasonable result.
They were probably best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last game, but with the audience behind us I am sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been tough because of everything that has happened with my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can run on now, put last season behind us and succeed.”
Fear of pension savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the study participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be treated, only a few spoke to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationswide survey said they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t do anything to start the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t tell them about your wishes in good time.
Use your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be crucial factors for the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for your expenses.
Long-term care can be financed through, among other things, a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment, or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have the finances for it.
Get organized the legal documents: Take the legal battles in the run-up.
Get a power of attorney prepared so you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and nurses meet your wishes, in case you can’t communicate yourself.
Consider an economic power as well.
In that case, you appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure your bills are paid if you don’t have the opportunity to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that one of your aging parents is in urgent need of medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Get all these details down in writing so you’re ready.
“It’s not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who will take care of the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a trip to the city.
The victim was in the 1940s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, middle floor and hand.
The officer describes the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m., as "completely random."
The victim did not see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, who expect the death toll to rise.
Since the communication routes are out of play, emergency workers have not been able to receive information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the earthquake.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that extends over more than 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the cornerstones of the Central Sulawesi economy, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but takes place mainly in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s disaster center.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami that killed nine.
Indonesia is seismologically located on the so-called fire in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, including over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and only in April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake measuring 6.8 struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake hit the Aceh regency and spread destruction and panic as the population was reminded of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
A tsunami was not triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and to oppose arrest, according to the report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 security deposit, KTUU reports.
He was brought to court on Saturday, where he declared himself "absolutely not guilty," the network reports.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, which can lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offence, which could lead to a single day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with offences.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently under trial at the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, having prevented the reporting of a violent crime in the home as well as possession of weapons in the affected state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of giving her a blow to the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for explaining her son’s violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his posting in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication routes, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just south of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulating showing the moment when the earthquake hits.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Prosecutors Attempt to Get Terrorist Suspect in NYC Sentenced to Rare Death Penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to get the death penalty awarded to Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the New York City terror attack, who killed eight people – a rare punishment that was last convicted of a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rental car from the Home Depot construction market to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who came in the way were swept down.
As a basis for the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious personal injury. This is required by the death penalty declaration in New York's southern district.
According to the court document, the death penalty is a possible result of both these charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury could present Saipov for a 22-point indictment, including eight charges of murder in connection with gangster activity, typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "comprehensive planning and preparation," the prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution as "irresponsible, malicious and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, bodily injury and loss for families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pangnucco," he says.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since New York’s southern district last filed a death penalty lawsuit against the defendant.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but ended up serving a life sentence in September 2009.
In 1953, the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to the legal documents, showed no sign of remorse in the days and months after the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he was fine with his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag hung up in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded guilty to the 22 points of the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public defenders, said they were “of course disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defenders had previously asked the charges not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative minister says NIGEL FARAGE should take over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army” during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said politicians could “mark the pressure” from the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May’s own ministers had said Farage should take over negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that Britain would have been "out now" if Farage had been a Brexit negotiator.
May’s challenge to create a rally in the deeply divided party is underlined by the participation of conservatives in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan on track under attack from both Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite the setback, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or “chaos”.
To the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given him the responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
The Wellingborough minister added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we have to scrap the Chequers."
On the basis of his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight World War II to be someone’s subordinate.
We will decide our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected that the public’s position should have changed since the 2016 vote: “That the British people should have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
The Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told the journalists: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us elected.
Now drop the Chequers and start listening.'
As a pointed remark to May, she added: "Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the motion that politicians should be able to "mark the pressure" if they fail the decision from the 2016 vote.
“Now it’s a question of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They want to betray Brexit, but we’re gathered to tell them that we’re not letting them go.”
In a message to the enthusiastic public, he added: “You have to make sure that the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, can feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, remnants marched through Birmingham before a two-hour drive into the city centre.
Widespread activists fanned with Conservative Mod Brexit banners after the formation of the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the security problems with the Conservative Party app before the meeting.
“It’s the people who claim to have control over Canada’s IT systems and technology, to border controls, to free trade without borders in Ireland,” he said.
"It's all for laughs.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren 'considers hard' to run for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren, a member of the House of Representatives, said she was "considering a lot of running for president" after the midterm elections in November.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future at a city council meeting on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, will try to win re-election in November against the state's Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It has been speculated that she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters at the city hall since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it’s time for “women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front.”
Arrest in case of shooting at LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday for the shooting of Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge reported that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested Friday for an ET news meeting at 11 a.m.
They released a video Friday of the shooting to ask for help identifying a man on the footage.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and killed by the injuries,” said Murphy J. Paul, chief of police.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to having been present, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without problems and is now in police custody in the East Baton Rouge district.
Sims was a two-metre-high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 games, started in ten and played an average of 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Cup, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team’s orders would play a crucial role in the race.
From the lead position Bottas got a good start and was close to tying Hamilton off as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in pit as the first, and let Hamilton fight with traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went into pit a half later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front, as the Ferrari driver after some wheel contact had to reluctantly leave the infield after a double defense on the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after the first half on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race when, in an attempt to a quick finish, he failed to change tyres to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He had to pitch in the 44th inning, but could not increase the pace in the last eight innings, which is why Raikkonen secured fourth place.
"It's a tough day because Valtteri did it fantastic all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me get by.
The team did an incredible job of securing us both first and second place,” Hamilton said.
Really bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday because she insisted she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony Ford had given before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "evil and repugnant and dishonest."
“The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last couple of days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and then they say, 'Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, was it you who leaked it?
Remember her answer... Was it you who leaked the document – “Oh, oh, what?
No, no.
I didn’t leak anything.”
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
If we leak... No, we didn’t leak anything,” he added in an imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter about Ford’s accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I haven’t hidden Dr. Ford’s accusations, and I haven’t leaked her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said at Saturday's election meeting: "I'm telling you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Under the president’s continued defense of the nominee judge to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, Trump suggested that Democrats used the charges to benefit their own cause.
"They do not use any means in their efforts to take back power.
You can see the malice, the reluctance, they don't care who they're going to drum up to get power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars did well again after Friday’s Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly came forward with two goals with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized at home, before Dwyer again brought the Giants in front.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's game in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, where the Giants went out as champions in the previous three games.
Dwyer scored in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as an assist, as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt was behind Cownie's equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants came ahead at the first break, as he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard equalled again with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four out of their five games, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died to ensure hundreds of air passengers escaped earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with several hundred passengers safely landed on Earth.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing, after a major earthquake on Friday hit Sulawesi Island and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks are still ravaging the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his seat in the floating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed in his place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was held on the runway, came safely into the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian ABC News.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan that would take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're broken," he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand, and the country’s disaster preparedness announces limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them," said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, who is holding a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in emergency aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
All the shops have been looted.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re coming to.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country’s military: “I ask you all to work around the clock to carry out all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombrok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says a man is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing, even though it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini stated that it could not locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for more information about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew, after the plane hit the water while landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been driven to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital until Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers could go into the water to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the crew panicked and shouted, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working on renovating a nearby dock also helped in the rescue by using a rubber boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 meters.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts set timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office ended its evidence on Saturday in the indictment of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett gave testimony for several hours as expert witnesses in the field of data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used tele-information to piece together the course of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several different mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he had claimed that he, along with his friend Michael Sanford, visited police in Sanford.
Sanford sat down at the witness's office Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Political Hip-Hop?
A hiphop trio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that hip hop has moved away from its origin with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a revival in the UK due to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Still a black person?!
New York nanny sues couple after firing with "racist" text
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory firing after being sent a text message by a mistake from her mother, who complained that she was “another black person.”
The couple denied that they were racist, but compared the lawsuit to "squeezing".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who is the mother of two, expressed her horror at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEJ, NOT ENDU ENGLISH A SORT PERSON," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice fired and said that their former nanny, who was from African-American, had been bad for her work, and that she instead expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one-day work and sent home in an Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the burning as well as compensation for $350 a day for the six months she was supposed to have lived with her family, even though this was agreed without a contract.
“I would like to show them that you can’t afford to do such a thing,” she told the newspaper Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have defended themselves that they are not racists, and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
“My wife had come to send her something she wouldn’t have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Plasco told The Post.
“But would you leave your children to someone you’d been helpless to, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
Quite honestly.”
Plasco compared the lawsuit to " extortion" and that his wife had been born two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you really looking for someone like that?
It’s not very friendly,” added the investment adviser.
Although the trial is still underway, the People’s Court has already written off the couple on social media and exhausted their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, said of the letter: “It’s hard to imagine being the one reading it for the first time before it was published.
It’s pretty fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington became.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small wardrobe, would have been optimistic, even though his story was rejected, and that the 60-year-old for the publication of the books was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modesty was proud of her success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't bother to brag," she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt like you had a child who achieved something: You’re proud of them, even though it’s not really your profit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington's fault."
Saying goodbye to the dying daughter over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn’t survive,” Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad that she would die within the next couple of minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you later.
The medicine she had received to keep her heart going slowly lost their effect.
She had died shortly before, and now her body was shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get together.”
Finally, the mournful Ednan-Laperouse went on board the plane along with the other passengers, who did not know what she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
“I bowed my head and the tears continued to run.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Sorrowful Women Trying to Stop Suicide Shoppers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have mapped a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers to get help.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he was diagnosed with depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to experience the grief I experience every day,” she said.
Sharon Davis, 45, said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
“His smile was familiar to everyone.
People said his smile lit up the room.”
However, he stopped working before he died because he was really sick.
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found him when he took his own life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid it's spreading."
Sharon Davis made the cards to “tell people that there’s someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don’t go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone.”
Sharon Davis' long-time girlfriend, Kelly Humphreys, lost her boyfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say anything about being sad or depressed or anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, he began to change.
He was really far down on Christmas day. When the kids opened their gifts, he didn’t have any eye contact with them at all.”
She said his death was very traumatic for them, but that they need to get through it: “It has created a hole in our family.
It has torn us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future remains unclear as FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a time-limited study with limited scope – maybe we could get a little bit of a deal,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “fall from the bottom” amid the tight-knit party situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not have the FBI conducting their investigation?
Their reluctance is due to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away on November 6, and if Republicans, as expected, fail, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to have elected to the country’s highest judicial office.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and thereby met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI completes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'falls' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from South Korea’s merger ministry and said there were 1,127 defectors last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human traffickers were contributing to the changed numbers.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
By far the majority of North Korean defectors will eventually be offered citizenship in South Korea.
South Korea’s government says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most people flee via China, which has the longest border collapsing up to North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, so they are often forced to return home.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is technically still at war – has improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to talk about the stranded negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This comes after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korea on a global level.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we will degrade on our own,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit for the Supreme Court
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for Supreme Court justices, "hysterical" and said that his temperament was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosis's comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved that way, you would have called her hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his years in high school, he almost cried and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats on the committee and called the accusations against him "grotesque and a coordinated character courage" arranged by the left wing, angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s statement proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he is biased towards the Democrats.
“I think he has disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi went out when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to a throne if he is confirmed and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I want to say that if he doesn’t speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly not in the court he’s sitting in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge in the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in connection with Obama's health reform or the abortion case Roe v. Wade, because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would circumvent certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, prejudiced person should contest a job as a judge and expect us to say 'yes, it's not just nice,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It’s a fair outcome, several months and years of anger that comes over, and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal, do you?"
She continued: “I received great support from a woman who was the boss who said that she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the one she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sorry because I’m sorry.
But I'm angry."
And then she just got caught.
And I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an excess of men where I often cry out of anger, where I was taken by the neck of an older woman – a cold boss that I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll accept that they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a member of the Colorado Democratic Congress, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to have an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and retired as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and found that she could just as well stand up as a presidential candidate.
“It wasn’t a particularly thoughtful decision,” she said laughing to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they definitely didn't need another candidate.
Some called it 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'.
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was behind fundraising, so she promised she wouldn’t participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she made a speech that she would not stand up, she was overwhelmed by feelings—thankfulness to the people who supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach voters instead of voters, and anger at sexism—that she got a lump in her throat.
"You could think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
"You would think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my gravestone?
"She cried"?
How the U.S.-China trade war could be an advantage for Beijing
The opening salvos in the U.S.-China trade war were loud, and even though the battle far from over, the split between the countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on important Chinese export goods, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week of new customs duties affecting $200 billion worth of goods is in principle half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has repeatedly retaliated, most recently by imposing tariffs of 5-10% on U.S. goods for $60 billion.
China has vowed to follow the U.S. all the way, and the world’s second-largest economy is probably not going to give up just yet.
If it makes Washington withdraw its demands, it means they give in, but for China’s president, Xi Jinping would be too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the US pressure in the trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
“A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the ground for an economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it’s actually much more dangerous than one thought,” said Abigail Grace, a research fellow with a focus on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' to receive refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the refugees to return and calls for help in building the country that has been devastated by the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government has continued to control the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state.
All conditions are now present for refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011, when the war began.
An additional six million people who are still in the country are in need of emergency assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would like to receive assistance in rebuilding the country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped support the rebellion.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated the US team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside of Paris.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's team reached the 14.5 points it required to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time in most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake at par 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari managed well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have won 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament's current format began.
American Jordan Spieth was broadcast with 5&4 by the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
No. 1 on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in his luggage, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament’s most winning European with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t do it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
It’s a holding effort, and I’m glad I could help,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He forwards the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who dropped the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It is a funny statistic for one of the best golfers ever to have won 14 major titles, only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had trouble finding the form all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of the guys, because they fought for the case.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe a counterplay.
You lost.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We will regroup, and I will cooperate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we will move on.
I love the 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
