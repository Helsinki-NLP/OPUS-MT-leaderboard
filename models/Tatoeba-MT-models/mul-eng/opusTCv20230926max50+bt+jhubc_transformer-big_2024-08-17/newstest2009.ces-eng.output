The Prague Stock Exchange is down to the end of trading.
After a sudden collapse in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected losses.
Transactions with CEZ shares have reached almost half of the normal daily trade.
The Prague stock market has been tying up since the beginning of Tuesday’s trading to its Monday decline, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, there is a decline in Wall Street stock.
In this way, the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan for stabilising the financial sector there, is manifested.
The fall of stocks in Asia
A dramatic fall on Tuesday saw stocks on the Asian stock exchanges, although the indexes eventually wiped out some of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index recorded almost four per cent in the course of trading, but later wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 per cent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, and markets in Shanghai were closed.
Stocks on the Sydney stock market lost more than five percent, but eventually fell to 4.3 percent.
According to the Taiwan Stock Exchange Index, the stock market fell 3.6 percent.
“The timing of the rescue operation in the US is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although part of China, defines its monetary policy independently, i.e. without dependence on the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should quickly return to negotiations and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will be affected as well.
Bloodbath of U.S. stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was to be spent up to $700 billion (nearly CZK 12 trillion).
The lawmakers ignored President George W. Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indices recorded the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent and a similar decline was last recorded in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the bill had not passed the House, the index was in free fall.
U.S. government could pump $700 billion into banks
The U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed to a broader financial assistance agreement for the U.S. financial system.
The vote will be at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a bailout plan in the form of financial aid for the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee of the House of Commons, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
According to sources in the Senate, the plan could probably be voted on as early as Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that a rescue plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor for the revival of financial markets.
Then, however, there will be a "reconciliation" thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms to help the markets reach even in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differing views on what the shape of the package should look like to stabilize the market," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
She said the final vote could be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definitive form to the government fund.
It should buy off non-selling mortgage assets from financial companies that drag financial firms into serious losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must be effective on the market as well.
We still need to go on with the health plan, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Trading
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final deal in Congress on Sunday.
In doing so, they want to reassure investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where Congress’ decision could affect Monday’s trading.
However, it is not yet clear with certainty when both chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law, nor whether they can tie the negotiations to any problem at the last minute.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is still subject to a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is expected to be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amounts if it has the impression that the program will not fulfill its function, followed by another $100 billion and later a final $350 billion.
Bush Appreciates Progress in Negotiations
The President may veto this decision, but Congress may vote on his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to raise funds for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, remained.
"We've worked it all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and appreciated “the shared effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restrictions on Gold Pads
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed to take responsibility for the money program, protect taxpayers from losses, close reliefs, timing the financing of the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called gold falls for the directors of the company participating in the program and establishes a committee that will have oversight over the fund.
It should be run by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this and made great progress towards an agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also counts with the help of homeowners who have problems with payment.
The government should negotiate new payments on the mortgage it buys, in order to reduce the monthly cost of payments to borrowers and allow them to leave their homes.
Brand: Psychic Help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Mark, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement it.
“And that’s because we don’t know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will buy out.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government will split the losses between each other," Marek told iHNed.cz server this week.
If the plan is approved now, or at the beginning of next week, according to Mark, it's not that important.
“It’s much more important that this week’s congressmen agree that they support this plan and that it will be done as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on approval is the most important at the moment,” said Marek.
Fight on the blade of a knife: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
It seems clear that it is better to just buy a phone.
Yet there are plenty of reasons why a person should buy a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the claims of the future owner.
Perhaps it’s hard to get a top-notch expensive phonograph at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
However, such music products on LP records do not originate and there is no objective reason to do so from a qualitative point of view.
However, if your shelves are made of vinyl with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably dream of such a gramophone at least.
The same is true with music on the road, i.e. music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For someone, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, as well as Pink Floyd fans may find it difficult to narrow the headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, among which there is plenty of room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also determines the battery life.
Some top music players will manage much more than just playing music, but that’s what most mobile phones don’t even happen to.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, telephoning and e-messaging, he can play music and video, both record, have a better camera, and maybe even navigate.
And when we take in the question of smartphones and communicators, you will have in your pocket a small computer.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can photograph anything.
The universality of mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest bursts of energy.
A small cell phone can play music for more than twelve hours, usually it’s much less.
In this direction, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobiles, therefore, count on the fact that they will not play for more than a few hours.
If you still call here and there, come to work for the safety of another charger - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won’t have this problem, even the worse will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem arises when recording music on your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a small reader of the card will consult with miniature memory cards, which are used in mobile devices without reduction.
You don’t need any special software for players up to exceptions (iPod).
Simply fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobiles and players will already create a music library by themselves, sorted by the name of the performer, the name of the album, the genre or the user rating.
Some devices display only the tree structure of directories similar to the Windows Explorer, and some are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are able to serve, mobiles are able to do more
When choosing a particular device, you are particularly interested in battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output, and of course also in the comfort of control.
If your music is mostly in the background and you listen to it every day just briefly on the tram, you just need any cell phone that plays MP3.
This is something that almost any mobile phone can do.
You don’t even have to watch too much to see what music formats the mobile or player can.
MP3 will handle all and the vast majority of the music that gets to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widespread and in addition to it, the vast majority of devices will also manage the music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobiles also allow you to buy music online, for example.
It is enough through the mobile internet to visit the relevant website of the operator (or another provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could in itself be a down-to-earth argument for the acquisition of a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and is usually limited to fast-paced radio hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, the internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people still carry their cell phones with them.
Whenever you get the desire to hear something, your phone in your pocket snaps, while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry a headset with you or at least a wireless handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every phone, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music mobiles will be for many prices.
The cheapest ones are usually under three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns you will already acquire a very decent walkman.
However, most of the time you will be limited by the absence of the output to normal headphones.
The best and most technically equipped phones, even with a 3.5mm headphone jack, cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy service.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players will be able to really control everyone.
The minimum functionality, the similarity of the control with a previously common cassette player or perhaps a phonograph is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of an error on the mobile internet and then a huge account for data transmission.
What device to touch
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot on interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant card, you will enter up to two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player yet, tap Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) you do not need to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you’re one of the more demanding listeners, you’d rather go for specialized mobiles – walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokias and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the service is so close to a separate MP3 player.
It is still in the Sony Ericsson industry, whose mobiles from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the separately sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours maximum), will take you MP3 players from the above mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here - a virtual operator that would make the classics cheaper.
Maybe it won't be long.
The fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have written to Mobil.cz many times.
Finally, it was also confirmed by the CTU, which warned that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, there may be a paradox - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to get into the fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, we have three mobile networks here and penetration is well over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to joke about the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
They are often called by Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who has repeatedly stated that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classical operator with his own network probably no longer has a chance (by the way, it would probably be hard to find frequencies already).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
Just the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market brought a significant price reduction, to which also classical operators had to react.
At the same time, before the entry of the stickers such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, voices similar to ours were sounded in the UK.
However, it turned out that a place for such operators is and can be really successful.
We don’t have to go too far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
Meanwhile, Mobilking is behind the Penta financial group, which owns U:fona, among other things, in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order for them to function effectively, they need far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry with them relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators are usually profiled as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, but this is often balanced by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good move and bet on an unbiased target group.
This operator is focused specifically on men.
“Managers choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could be caught up with us.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic without a chance, say mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look too promising.
Rather, there will be the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region," Jan Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for Penta's financial group, told Mobil.cz.
In this way, she confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Rather, on the contrary, it tries to do everything in order to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
The GTS Novera Group has long been interested in launching a virtual mobile operator, which would like to take the next step towards becoming a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in providing our customers with not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already managed to make progress in the negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl, a spokesman for the group.
Maybe it's going to lighten up for better times.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator should wait perhaps until the end of the year.
For the time being, however, its emergence is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not think that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, no entity has contacted us with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> from the Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 press department said in a statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators are also referring to the specificity of the Czech market.
Martin Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1>, press spokesman for T-Mobile, adds in rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not yet recorded any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which it would be possible to build further."
He adds: “In the T-Mobile network, it’s hard to find a virtual operator by the end of the year.
At this point, we should already have a specific agreement on the table to be able to think about it in this short horizon."
Vodafone is paying more attention to meeting its own 3G licensing requirements.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: "By negotiating with potential virtual operators, we are open, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we consider to be the most beneficial from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The process of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a decrease in prices and thus also to a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when it comes to operators, they can pull one rope at a time, also testifies to the tatany around the creation of the U:phone.
Perhaps the greatest pressure towards <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was at the time of the creation of the U:phone from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> website.
But now U:fon is suitable as an argument why the virtual operator should not be allowed.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> said: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been further strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and especially on his services."
However, due to this approach of mobile operators, there is a direct inconsistency of the Czech regulatory authorities.
However, it is not just the attitude of the CTU, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries - does not have the power to intervene in economic competition.
They belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
But he took his typical attitude to the whole issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has yet been concluded, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," said Kristian Chalupa, from the Department of External Relations of the OHS.
It is not surprising that this expression has been formulated by the representatives of the operators.
From an authority that is meant to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses its position on the market, it is more than respectable.
Especially when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: “In a foreign country where virtual operators are commonly active, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services.”
But apparently, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the decline in prices do not belong to the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
In the shocking truth of the whole case, there is up to a dramatic contraction of three mobile operators, which results from their reaction.
The question, if it is really just a coincidence, is offered entirely by itself.
As well as absolutely the same price of gasoline at pumping stations is certainly just a work of chance and a tough competitive battle.
"The Office has not found any evidence of any counter-intelligence in this matter, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their dealings in the market.
The necessary tools to open the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to meet the telecommunications regulator as well," Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many contentious points.
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications from the point of view of competition are the only market.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the creation of a virtual operator always requires the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - on his network monopoly.
So in a certain segment it must necessarily be dominant.
However, even if we do not allow this argument, it should be at least a warning to <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators are acting in a similar manner.
Complaints by a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) indicate that they encounter very similar obstacles in dealing with all operators.
Taking responsibility for <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications, by which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS gives away the whole issue of hands.
We have met with him in a number of similar cases.
Unfortunately, to the recently adopted novelties of the telecommunications law, the extension of the powers of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> to the field of economic competition in telecommunications has failed to establish, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation since then.
The representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS need to know more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
That's what happens when no one looks
At the same time, the operation of some pseudo-virtual operators, some of which exist in Czech mobile networks immediately remains unnoticeable.
They are companies that provide their own price lists of mobile phone services, which are only partially public.
This is usually the case with companies that are engaged in multi-level marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The pricelists of these companies will usually only get to the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic corporate customer to the operator, who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, you will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there were any cases you're talking about, it could be a violation of the terms of the contract we're dealing with and it could lead to the termination of cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> said in a statement.
However, it is quite unlikely that similar action would not be taken against responsible people from mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are able to prevent this from happening.
The activities of these companies have an undeniable advantage and, unlike the actual virtual operators, they do not in any way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculation, however, the services of these companies use only an negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not led to their name, so they cannot have it fully as normal customers of mobile operators.”
But that should be at least weird.
In addition, another question is opened for UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes above a similar procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has relatively strong powers to disclose similar activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the operators' explanation that they have no idea of such a thing and their business conditions prohibit it.
When we are not the most expensive
As has already fallen several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable decline in prices for services.
In virtually all countries where virtual operators were created, the classical operators tried more or less to defend their creation.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - too small, possibly too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was at this time that regulatory authorities were involved, which were defending not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether by formal measures or by informal pressure, the first virtual operator was created, and the next one was dealt with.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators overwhelm the whole case like a hot potato.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that uncertainty in competences is more than appropriate for them in these cases.
But let us not draw near to the grain.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator will appear with us really soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the operators has allowed the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain ineligible to reject (discrimination) other interested parties.
And we must stop calling for a path rather than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four versions of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek presented new recordings of the national anthem Where Home Is Mine on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day.
The anthem was re-recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vk.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in the chorus and instrumental version.
The song was sung by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
Bélohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers the Czech national anthem one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told the Czech radio that he deliberately chose to sing solo versions of singers with young representative voices, which are distinctive and popular.
"I've been with both of them from the beginning and then I've been trying to take care of the congregation so that they have a clear dictation, so that the text is well understood, so that they're cognizant," he said.
Next year, the Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary.
Song Where my home first sounded in 1834 on the boards of the Stavovsk<0xC3><0xBD> Theatre in the original Czech game Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ek Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyla accompanied by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroupa.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously took it for their own.
The first line of the song then became a natural part of the national anthem after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What is the “New” Hymn?
Prague MHD on Wednesday for the first time on a chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers who will have an electronic voucher in their pocket instead of a paper ticket will enter the metro, tram and buses.
At the moment, it can hire about one hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (it will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time let to upload to their chip card in infocentres and workplaces of the Transport company in metro stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0x88>vice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly.
Coupons can also be purchased from yesterday via the Internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers in the afternoon.
Those who start using the internet store can definitely forget about the outlet window in the subway stations, where they have so far had to regularly stand on long fronts on paper tickets.
The coupon will be purchased via the Internet and will be deposited in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library on the Opencard card.
"At these places, passengers are provided with a trained service pass, which will help those interested in buying the internet and also upload a voucher purchased on their ticket," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard also in self-service vending machines, which are installed in several metro vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, remind the ticket markers and passengers may have noticed them already at the metro stations of Roztyla, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"There are now five in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," he added.
The coupon will check the driver's location automatically
Working with the machines that will start working tomorrow is easy.
It is enough to insert an Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will be uploaded to it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, in suburban trains and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, from which the inhabitants of the Central Bohemian municipalities drive to the capital.
“In trains included in Prague integrated transport, guides are equipped with reading cards, which determine the time and bandwidth validity of the vouchers,” explained Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal from Ropid, a Prague public transport organisation, who compiles the timetable for the public transport.
The suburban buses have a card reader built into the driver's safe.
When you arrive, it is not only necessary to show the driver a chip card, but in addition, it is necessary to attach Opencard to the designated place on the side of the box.
In this way, the driver will check the validity of the recorded coupons.
“If a passenger needs to verify the validity of the recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information,” Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal added.
Passengers who do not drive suburban buses and will not remember when their coupon expires can go back to the self-service vending machines where the coupons on the card are recorded.
Here, information about the validity of their documents is displayed on the display of the device.
Sudeten wants a U.S. referendum
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans requested the inclusion of <0xC5><0xA0>umava in the United States.
It comes from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans reportedly turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is due, among other things, to a letter that was kept in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from the Czech Krumlov are asking in a letter from the US president not to allow the return of the "<0xC5><0xA1>umavski <0xC5><0xBD>upa" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly, and we want to be sure that American troops come to Germany not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter reads, signed with the words "People who are doomed to <0xC5><0xA0>umava".
Since the accession to Czechoslovakia is allegedly giving the Sudeten Germans - in knowledge of the Czech national nature - hope only for brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter of the US President are asking him to take over the <0xC5><0xA0>umavou for a more recent period.
“We can’t believe that regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would admit this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and repels a minority and nothing, at all, contribute to the victory of the United States,” the letter said.
The reason why the authors can’t sign up is allegedly a concern about the vengeance of “Czech oppressors”.
If the president of the United States allegedly doubted the thinking of the Schumau Germans, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the Schumau County on whether its residents want to be part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a bit naive in today’s post-war history, according to some memorabilia, it adequately illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that it would be their expulsion from the Republic, few of them had ever admitted such an option.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate with the Sudetenland a certain kind of autonomy.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who was born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
During the war, he was a buddhist German stationed in the Baltic Sea.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a concentration camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they got home, Czech would be good for them," Chalupa said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia were expected to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
You don't think - you'll pay!
An emotional campaign will attack the driver.
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Nevertheless, it would be possible to characterize the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ka promises to rid the driver of dangerous driving behaviour.
The campaign for 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on airplanes.
It should keep the driver away from driving fast and alcohol behind the wheel.
And also remind them to connect before they leave.
He wants to raise the awareness of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Mostly human stories that attack the emotions.
And this is evidenced by the "blood" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written in big letters on a spezet.
And in the pool of blood there is the word "pay".
This is to symbolize that one can pay attention to one’s own life in a moment.
The audience will be “feared” by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with dramatic images of the victims of the accident can be seen commonly.
It promises to reduce accidents and the number of dead on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whisky on the driver
"The driver has a sugar and a whip system.
The sugar for them is that if, for example, they go on red, it will save time.
A whip is a threat of punishment or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says transport psychologist Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need information campaigns in the press, and mostly negative ads, my psychologist.
He says that the tables that warn drivers of the danger are already less effective.
"If a static hazard warning board is installed, it will likely soon merge with the surrounding area and the drivers will not engage in it," Koran said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The President of the Provisional Government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, namely Pre-Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published by the Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to treat the Palestinians with a similar percentage [of Israeli territory] because without that there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that the possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want his tractors or bulldozers to cross his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in a statement, referring to the July attacks on the city.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historic places" that lie within the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he added.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed his support for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of the departure from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up in order to win the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship to (the Shi'ite movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the enduring support they provide to (the Shi'ite movement) Hamas, (the terrorist networks) al-Qa'ida.
Questions after the accident: Are the stevardi in the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In the context of the student agency bus accident near the Italian Padua, the question arose as to whether stevardi and passengers can travel by bus.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of the steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, in which a twenty-year-old stewardess died last week, was apparently caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus.
At that moment, the girl unfortunately sat next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although there are two other places reserved.
However, the bus can crash or brake abruptly, even at a time when the stevard spreads coffee or newspaper.
The role is played by whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces according to the technical certificate.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
Student Agency buses do not have places to stay; which is confirmed by Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz also the director of Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"We have dealt with this with the Ministry and at first did not allow the movement of passengers.
Then they called it off and we got to the point that passengers can go for toilet rides if they have their own seat," he said.
Steward's Law is not known
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward - no legal regulations solve this role.
However, no legal provision prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term guide vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds the spokesman Hanselka.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, head of the traffic department of the Ministry of Transport, believes that the problem is sufficiently addressed by the law.
"It depends on whether the bus in the approval has permitted parking spaces.
It ends," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas, where there are parking spaces and limited maximum speed, intercity with parking spaces with higher speed allowed and remote without parking spaces with the highest speed allowed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
The BESIP expert on transport safety Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n in the movement of the stevards on board the bus does not see a major problem.
"There is no danger in flying, the situation can be compared to the service in the aircraft.
Even here, it is not certain when the turbulence will come and the plane can crash into the head."
"But if the bus brakes sharply, of course, the physical laws apply.
Just like the city bus or tram.
The safety of the stewards must be addressed by internal regulations," he says and also believes, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel the service
Student Agency offers the services of stevards as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
Even after an accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the job of stevards is risky, I'll cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers are available to guests upon arrival.
It would also save costs,” he said.
As an interest in safety, the absence of stevards in their cars was justified by the director of Asiana Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA.
"We don't have a stewardess, we've been against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in some fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
It has become an immense tragedy.
A young stewardess from Plze<0xC5><0x88>ska, who worked for the company for two years, died in the accident of a link connection to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably veered off the runway without the use of a gauge and blocked the way of the bus.
His driver tried to avoid a rush of maneuvers, but he made the right front part of it.
That two places reserved for the rest of the stevards would be sold out, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses.
"These places can't be reserved for long-distance connections, they're blocked."
The company intends to sue the driver of the truck.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait at the courthouse, but the financial compensation is also expected by the culprit.
Editing the law?
In the Unsupervised
The clarification of the movement of the stevards on board the bus could lead to an amendment to the law, which over the year is being worked on by a thirty-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
"It did not come to any specific conclusion, however.
Buses don’t solve much, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of a mobile phone when driving,” says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards to be something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers,” Hanselka concludes, adding that the control of the safety of buses is in the hands of the police and the safety authorities at work.
The hope of D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf is Frankfurt
There is no shortage of big words in the letter from the WestLB board of directors to the employees of this bank.
The merger of the units of this D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf monetary institution with the Frankfurt-based Deka-Bank will create "central financial group institutions dedicated to trading in capital markets," we read in the letter, which was made available to the public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will introduce a "set of competences" to ensure long-term returns in this transaction.
And, he says, such a merger can be a decisive impulse for further consolidation in the land bank sector.
Such texts arise when the board wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Office for Supervision of Financial Services, whose message to the Land Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deca-Bank, which customers are keenly aware of for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever its type, has been talked about for a long time – even on the Frankfurt side.
The head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas, at the presentation of the half-year management results at the end of August, made it clear that the merger of his bank house from Mainzer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e with one of the land banks, such as Helaba or WestLB, makes no sense.
However, the Deka-Bank Board of Directors, which consists of one half of the country’s bank and the other half of the consortium, has entrusted the board of directors with conducting talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about trading on the capital market or part of it.
However, the negotiations have only just begun, the financiers point out.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the most important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, does not speak for the first time in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it appeared that a merger of Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helab could occur.
In the end, there was nothing from this triangle.
Shortly after the merger plans were made public, the Hesse Land Government spoke out against the participation of Helaba Bank.
The other two banks didn’t get along that way either.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz acquired Landesbank Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg from Stuttgart.
However, there has been repeated speculation about Deka-Bank’s connection with the country’s banks.
Recently, however, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Helab, spoke negatively about the connection of his financial house with others.
However, it seems that regardless of this, it is rooted in the conviction that the convergence of the various banking houses of the public sector is a necessity.
Now, after the elections to the Landesbank in Bavaria, BayernLB’s connection with Landesbank Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg could begin for the first time.
That's not good news for Helab.
If the pressure on further mergers is expected to increase, the potential partners for such a merger are gradually emerging.
In the south, only the second violin would be played, although the financial crisis is still facing significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association with WestLB was again banned at the beginning of the year by the Hessen-Th<0xC3><0xBC>ringen Association of Savings Bank and Giraffe Banks, which has an 80 percent stake in Helab<0xC3><0xA4>.
This would seem to be the nord LB.
But geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how well the business models of individual institutions fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question of what kind of business model should be ensured by the future competitiveness of land banks, the German Union of Savings Banks, and jury banks have not yet answered.
It could also end with the distribution of WestLB, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
That is why the letter of the local board of directors mentions that it is seeking a "complex solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect with the connection of the individual components with Deka-Bank, will show the time.
Oktoberfest's second weekend is known as "the weekend with Italy"
It's the first time for Elena, the third or fourth time for Luc.
But this time around, Elena's gonna be like his girlfriend, and she says it's gonna be different.
Behind them, at the Kaiser’s five-litre courthouse, stands a stronger hanger and two hundred of tourists at the Oktoberfest show how deep tones can radiate his throat.
Elena Luca first dances and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking next to Puorta Nuova station, this evening at 23.45 four buses marked "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival at 6.30.
Three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, and one bus is exclusively operated by Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are singing with their flag, they were already celebrating at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, it's nothing for Italy.
To Marc, who wears a long jacket with a leather upholstery lining and glasses with wide silver rings, these three buses belong.
For five years he has been riding with them at Oktoberfest, only this year he organizes three trips.
On the night there, during the day between the stands with beer, at 22.30 departure back.
Overnighting would be just a waste of money, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome drink with Kaiser beer, cooked exactly according to the Bavarian Beer Purity Act, health insurance and German-speaking guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave at night, after the highway towards "Brennero".
Beer is not served, not yet.
The bus stops quickly, the passenger sleeps.
They're doing well, they're still going to need their strength.
It is being built in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where the number 8 motorway in front of Munich makes another stop and a lot of other buses with an Italian brand.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at midnight, according to the plan, there are about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco has his last speech, explains the plan of the attack.
First of all, put on a yellow hat.
On the left is written <0xC5><0xA0>vabachem "Oktoberfest", next to the Internet address of Marco's travel office: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!" calls Marco to the morning air.
"Go!" Go and place the seats at the back of the tent.
"Not in front, so as not to prevent, and not all yellow hats on the same bench, move around the room!"
It costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the damn thing.
"Show the security guards that we're behaving properly.
As soon as you leave your places, they're gone!"
Thirdly, "Be here again at exactly midnight tonight!" Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, a space with beer stalls.
Along the way, one member of the group hangs yellow hats as markers on trees, cedules and even on the electoral poster of one large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for the retreat.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as the "Weekend with Italy".
Exact data on the number of visitors are not available; there are about fifty thousand of those who set off on a journey across the Alps and enter beer stalls, ten percent of all visitors said to have arrived this weekend from Italy.
The ranks of the Munich police are strengthened by seven police officers from southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers are supporting the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads the national statistics, in which the Italians before the British (about 60 interventions) and the Raku<0xC5><0xA1>ana (about 80) with about 200 medicated octopuses.
Especially popular is the Hofbr<0xC3><0xA4>u estate in Italy.
A night of silence for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
Last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this politician used the word "relatively" and also involved in his claim that the German banking sector will not be spared the development of the crisis.
Because that happened over the last weekend.
The Dax Index follows a financial house that specializes in financing Hypo Real Estate (HRE) real estate will receive from a consortium of German banks a loan of several billion to protect against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the said loan aid would amount to up to 35 billion euros.
Interest will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only out of the amount actually exhausted.
The money is said to come from private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the subsidiary of Deffa.
According to the news report, this state financier has been refinanced extremely briefly on long-term projects for which he has borrowed money, which is no longer possible now because of distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve fell by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and the share of equity decreased slightly from 1.6 % to 1.45 %.
The normal returns and net returns on financial transactions fell to zero compared to last year, while the returns on the increased value of receivables and on certain securities, as well as the cancellation of credit trading reserves, fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenues from the compensation for subsequent accounting costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and the interest compensation under the tax regime and for the brokering of the trade for the group companies was the 16 per cent decrease on the revenue side still place.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier burned on mortgages for pet owners, which were then separated from the portfolio of services and further managed by Aareal Bank.
Since there was too little profit in classical state funding, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
From the value of their subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate now has to write something off, and these write-offs will have a "basic material effect" on calculating the profits and losses of the entire group, as some have left uncertain to hear.
The fact is that there will be no dividend.
By 2007, it had been cut by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been an important financier of state and infrastructure projects since the acquisition of Defpa.
Stronger than other institutions depend on refinancing in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the fall of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank loans practically dried up because the banks are guarding their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds every year for a part of the loan portfolio of Depfa – about 50 billion euros – for short-term refinancing.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financial need for this loan is covered for a supervisory period and the company is protected “from the influence of international money markets currently to a significant degree of incompetence.”
Other sources have been told that this money will provide refinancing until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to use the money markets in a timely manner.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group on the market is now ensured.
This is what the bank’s shareholders and creditors hope for.
But given the dynamics and unavailability of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even completely ruled out that the loan should not be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank on Sunday late in the afternoon reportedly stood before the insolvency, it is not able, however preliminary, to calm down passionately.
The stock price fell 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, bond prices were well maintained.
While preferential debts have practically not moved, secondary bond rates are losing out more significantly.
This concerns, in particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary of W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg Hypo and the logical bonds with maturity after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be understood after a significant focus on the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which introduced it into the company by taking over Depp, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and less-affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the payment of securities within their due date.
But there may also be something that almost no one dares to hope for at the moment – the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports that are coming at the same time as this partial statehood, the likelihood of bordering on certainty has now become only legitimate hope.
This will most likely prepare long-term creditors for a series of sleepless nights when they will decide whether to give up on their commitments.
Short-term investors can use the limit line at least to create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to the exchange rate yields of later years for the purpose of future payment of capital gains tax.
Silver and the secret of the bento box
When sixteen-year-old Sylvan Hiltrop’s first day at high school in Tachiban is to be introduced, the girls begin to wonder: this German is completely “kawaii”!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from mang. In her new blog about exchange stay she tells about Japan.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I had already been kicked out of my way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to the middle of Tachiban.
I had to find my own way, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachiban is not given as strictly as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin meeting after eight o'clock and twenty minutes before nine o'clock begins a short session with the teacher, the so-called 'home room'.
But before I started teaching, I had to imagine.
I am not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I put on my host mom’s old dress, plush blouses, blue underpants and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the bench and tried to say everything correctly: 'Saj<0xC3><0xB3>nar Wo och Sylvan...' - my name is Sylvan, I come from Germany and in a week my birthday is.
At that moment, I was so glad that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were squeezing, squeezing and waving, and I still heard the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my manga.
It is one of the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'lovely, sweet'.
Then I quickly took my place.
The girl next to me smiled wide enough, considered it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong called, I literally fell asleep.
They were talking about each other and they were shaking and they were asking me what was possible and what was impossible – and it’s really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the end of the day, they all packed their bentos.
My host mother also made me such a box for lunch - and that's something other than boring German meals.
I had rice with herbs, small pairs, salad with cucumbers and nuts, fruit and some fish in a tofu dough.
I don’t know what I’m eating here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
Of course, everything is really good.
Well, maybe even on a salad-loaded candle, no!
Benta at Japanese schools is not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that the girl gives the boy a hand-made bento, which in this case is particularly artistically adjusted, and hopes that the boy will get to know more about the break at the meal.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here, too.
‘Why Japan?’ my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said:
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
I've been reading manga for years now.
And to better understand these comics and their culture, I started to learn a little Japanese.
It was clear to me that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs, and habits.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Even rats have feelings.
When rats or snakes run away from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
The neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that even many animals have feelings.
But how would it be possible to verify that they feel the same when they behave the same way as we do?
In the online journal "Edge", contributions from well-known scientists have been published for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents the selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without you being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now, when we can’t even prove that consciousness has other people.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, once we begin to devote ourselves to a different kind and open up questions of perception or consciousness in general, we enter the inconvenient terrain, because the hardware does not agree.
When the rat is in danger, it will do what many other animals do: it will pretend to be dead, run away, or attack.
Humans behave in a similar way, from which some scientists resort to a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it easier to transfer our subjective experience to the animal experience.
However, this is because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its role in short-term memory and executive or control functions).
This vast area is considerably more developed in man than in other primates, and it seems that it is completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could hide the linguistic essence of a man: because so much of his perception is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could rule out animals.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, language would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever it may be constructed, would probably differ from most states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to find out what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it cannot be measured, nor, because of the special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, it puts us in the face of great problems.
Most of my excerpts relate to the content of conscious experience, but in addition, there is another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to examine processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and that is exactly what happens in the studies of short-term memory in primates, especially for example visualization.
But this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick devoted themselves to, focuses rather on the neural correlates of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but perhaps not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of nonfrontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does that mean for feelings?
I derive them from the fact that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
What we refer to as “fear” is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) utilizes operational memory.
Seen from this angle, the sensations are closely associated with those areas of the cortex that characterize the primates, and especially people.
In connection with the language nature, a subtle deviation of perception occurs, because with words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states, so that we can attribute them to others alongside ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that sensations arise from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortex and brain stem dedicated to body sensations, like Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Because this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could quietly participate in the feelings perceived by multiple animal races.
I cannot, in theory, object to this, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us to be fear in rats and humans is probably felt by both organisms in the same way: But how is it possible to verify, Pankseep goes on to say, whether rats and humans feel the same when behaving similarly?
Is he afraid of danger, and is he afraid of it?
From my point of view, just the similarity of behavior cannot prove the conformity of living.
It is true that the neural comparison moves us further: rats and humans have similar brain stems, on the other hand, no brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it were possible to prove it in a man: how would we want to prove it in a rat?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even swoops (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circles and language), I prefer to examine emotional behavior rather than the emotional perception of rats.
In any case, in this case, we can expect progress at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Just as with rats, I don’t explore language and consciousness, I don’t explore feelings, because I don’t know if they exist.
It can be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than throw myself against the wall repeatedly.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President of UEFA Platini: The time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that the preparations will soon be direct to the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability, together with Poland, to organize ME," Vasjunyk said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the early fulfillment of the schedule of construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are collapsing.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will decrease from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work now as quickly as possible," Ukrainian Union President Grigory Surkis said.
"Uefa will be watching us all the time."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish PZPN was recalled by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlock.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewieck<0xC3><0xBD>.
He said there is "a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP news agency.
"Uefa President Michel Platini has confirmed in a letter that this step will negate preparations for the 2012 European Cup."
Several teams from the first league were only convicted of forced descent last season due to manipulations, in the end they had to be moved even quickly to the beginning of the league.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Dennis Quaid is back on strike
She wanted to make an advertisement for a new movie, she talked in an interview about private things - and now she's having problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her former Dennis Quaid as a divorcee.
The one that burns and returns the blow.
Late War Roses by former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors are leading a nasty fight - in front of the public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week, first expressed the reasons for the breakdown of her marriage: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful.”
She said she only learned about the extent of the fraud after the divorce.
The inspiration for this mental striptease was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - which tells the story of a twisted marriage.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was striking: “She’s crazy,” said a forty-year-old New York Daily News actor that “Meg repeatedly overwhelms the history of our relationship and adjusts it.”
In addition, it is "politicizing" that the joint sixteen-year-old son Jack again "publicly recalls the pain and radical changes that are a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became a father of twins.
He concludes his reflections on bias as follows: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself lucky to have an amazing family that is doing great.”
Prices of flights and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to one recent study, flights in Germany were even cheaper by up to 50 percent.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have again been discounted - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its data on bookings made from the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found their significant decline in the second quarter.
After several years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already been reduced.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
The reason for this trend is that American Express sees the dollar as a weak exchange rate, which has caused the “decreasing desire of American tourists to travel.”
The decline in hotel prices also affected financial centers more than industrial centers such as Hannover, Cologne nad R<0xC3><0xBD>n or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent to a European record.
Also, the prices of the flights showed an even upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to kerosene irradiation, Economy class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, for fuel-intensive long-haul flights as much as 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the prices of Economy class flights dropped by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in Business and First-Class classes, knowledge changes were less significant.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, they grew by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
In the German national years, prices fell by even half, according to the study.
One of the reasons for this price drop is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, because of the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe, there is increased competitive pressure.
A sign of the tense situation is the disruption of non-performing airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that declared a competition in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
With a single punch and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukayov continues to fail to build a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - Enlarge Unsuccessful landing for representative Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach joined the game only late and failed to reach the point with a protruding balloon.
His report was accurately worded and sounded convincingly from his mouth.
He just knew he was right.
'We need a second goal, 'said Hermann Rieger in the corridor to the cabins of the Hamburg arena.
Much was not done in the catacombs, the break between the half-hours ended, and most people were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and enjoys more respect than many acting moments.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Coach Cornelius Jol's assistant pulled in and raised his finger to the sign of the match.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His command probably sounded the same: here with a second goal!
It didn't happen.
"It didn't look good here today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted it "more relaxed."
At 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburgers owe the head of Mladen Petric (11th) and the fact that the very weak Gladbachans could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV will celebrate 121 years of its existence this Monday.
So on Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and a live updated table on the video wall, where their team was listed as a premiant.
It'll be a birthday without a party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
He guesses that a continuous table result symbolizes the incalculability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petrice and FC Bayern won Jansen - is slow but still unable to shine.
"We need more feeling and more dribbling," Jol said emphatically.
After defeat in the vote
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first reports of the sinking of the rescue package caused a drop in the Dow Jones index of up to 700 points.
It was the biggest point loss in a single day in its history.
Later, Dow picked up something again.
At around 20.30, this most important global stock market barometer showed a five-percent decline to 10,579 units.
Nasdaq’s technology stock market was down more than seven percent at 1,548 points.
The worst was in Dow at this time American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America lost about 12 percent.
None of the titles were able to strengthen.
Goldman Sachs’ shares have lost nearly 10 percent.
A few days ago, a large investor, Warren Buffett, had a stake in this company.
Under the rescue plan, funds shall be made available for the purchase of so-called damaged mortgage papers.
However, the entire amount should not be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state should receive stock options lists of financial companies that could be paid back in the course of favourable development, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock prices in Europe are falling sharply
Billions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States does not relieve investors of doubt.
The share price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly down and downloads the index Dax.
The US Dow Jones index is losing despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank pushed the German stock index (Dax) deep into the minus.
The shares of the Munich-based real estate financier have lost up to three-quarters of its value despite the bailout of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank has lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important limit of 6,000 points and with a minus 3.7 percent, he scored 5,839 points.
All over the world, stock markets have gone to their knees.
In New York City, Wall Street’s business day began with significant losses.
Investors fear that a $700 billion bailout from the U.S. government might not be enough to resurrect the financial markets.
During the first hour of trading, Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on a bailout plan, the Senate could vote on October 1.
Other European stock markets were also moving in only one direction: in London the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s leading Nikkei index fell by 1.26 percent after initial gains to 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.

In MDAX they lost after the announcement of an increase in the share capital of Arcandor.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim recorded 23 million new shares.
The business and tourism group also announced that it does not sell shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have been unaware of one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity would not have to be entirely correct.
For nearly 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying through space.
The fault of the fuel lines, which will soon freeze, now threatens her death in winter.
Among scientists for years, one mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion - anomalies of gravitational dust.
Gravitational practice is the flight maneuver of space probes, in which they gain additional mobility in the gravitational field of a space body, such as Earth.
Thanks to this, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
But what the scientist has been saying for years in this case is surprising: flying bodies do not behave 100% as one would expect, according to the old good law of gravity.
On the contrary, there is an irregularity in speed.
The probes unexpectedly accelerate or slow down.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptized by the anomalies of gravity.
Several experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by curvature of space, would not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was not mistaken, and is trying to explain the anomaly of gravity by means of the so-called dark matter discovered by astronomers in space.
"The dark matter responsible for this anomaly could also be located very close to Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space scientists for about ten years.
It is obviously based on gravitational force, the effect of which on other space bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it itself is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, out of this dark matter is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt, the abduction of tourists is free.
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, according to a statement by the Italian foreign minister, the arrest of tourists in Egypt is once again at liberty.
Kidnappings from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shootout, six kidnappers were killed before they were released.
Five Germans were captured in the south of Egypt.
Negotiations on redemption are already underway.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of kidnappings.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists dressed in the Sahara are, according to everything, free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabiya and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release of Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are currently verifying their health status," Frattini said.
According to Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are in good order and safe.
All 19 participants of the expedition to the desert are reportedly already on their way to Cairo.
The background of the shooting remains unclear before the hostages are released: according to an Egyptian security official, the hijackers were ready to end the kidnapping even before the Sudanese army killed six of the hijackers by surprise.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom," said the quoted employee.
He said "it was just a matter of taking over the hostage" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers in a border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot and captured six of them.
The kidnappers asked Germany for a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
"El Masri El Jom" newspaper, referring to one of the German mediators, said the release of the hostages was stretching because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release the hostages of the female sex after the ransom was paid.
Men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse by a father "led to suicide"
Years of father abuse led a woman to kill herself, to be heard in court.
After admitting eight cases of sexual harassment, seven-year-old Michael Trerise of Stithian, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years.
The Truro Crown Court heard that he regularly tied his own daughter, Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in a confession.
The court also found that Ms. Randle was killed at her home in Mutley, Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and tied her eyes and then sexually abused her while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His own daughter went to Plymouth.
However, it appeared before the court that Ms. Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust, was haunted by the abuse that had been perpetrated on her twice a week.
The plaintiff, Ramsey Quaife, told the court in 2006 that they called Ms. Randle's friends, who were also very dedicated to surfing and cycling, that she was "emotionally dead" and that she "gave up her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
They say she's stuck in a bag of needles.
Randle stood face to face with his daughter’s father, who wrote a confession that ended with the words: “I bound her and bound her eyes.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said: “You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she hadn’t done so, she probably wouldn’t have gotten to court at all.”
“In particular, I would like to highlight the consequences that Stephanie’s parents have had on her daughter over the years,” he added.
"Obviously, otherwise, she would most likely be a promising, successful, and happy young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be charged.
The BBC has learned that a government official who left the secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two strictly secret documents on the train to Waterloo at a time when he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious violation of the said law and does not indicate a criminal intent.
The BBC’s defence correspondent Frank Gardner said such a move would be surprising to many at Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the ministry and the government office," he said.
An employee who cannot be appointed is charged under Section 8.1 of the relevant Act, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended to the Metropolitan Police to prosecute the official on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC).
The documents he forgot contained secret al-Qaida analyses and the potential of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown location.
Corporate reserves face debt B&B
Britain's co-operative reserves may have to settle more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million in debt after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million clients in Bradford & Bingley.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative deposits.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Cooperative Reserves (BSA), said it was "humiliating" that the reserves and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion-dollar debt will eventually be repaid by saving the Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest, which in the meantime settles, will be paid each year to all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The Fund's Financial Services Compensation Plan for the BBC has confirmed that all 59 cooperative reserves are listed in this figure.
It's humiliating that these institutions that have behaved so considerately... now have to pay some of the bills of those institutions that have not been so considerate so far.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay in proportion to the deposits it held, and that the reserves should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on debt will increase to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that the reserves will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the trade association of cooperatives, told the BBC that he is convinced that this is not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that, during the boom of the housing market, have now to pay some of the accounts of those institutions that have not been so considerate."
According to the BSA, no reserves have fallen since 1945, when they emerged.
“We’ll have to explore all aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what options are available to protect cooperative reserves and their members from an account that could be substantial,” Cole added.
The interest paid in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September until the end of March.
In 2010 there will be interest payments for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since cooperative reserves are non-shareholding organisations, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk costs 5 pens per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Jersey’s dairy company announced Monday it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre.
This is the second increase in prices this year, after a two-point increase in February, and comes after research conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the irritation in the customer’s prices.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of milk from Jersey last changed in 2002.
Banned for Bangladeshi Ex-Premier
The Bangladeshi court rejected the request of former Prime Minister Shaykh Hasina Vadjidov<0xC3><0xA1> to be released on bail, which means that if she returns to the country, she could be arrested.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the allegation that she obtained more than fifty million dollars ($729,700) from a certain businessman by extortion when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several charges of corruption that are brought against it.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>lida Zij<0xC3><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, longtime political rival Shaykh Has<0xC3><0xAD>na, was released earlier this month on bail.
Shaykh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has asked that the local army-held government give her complete freedom first.
Writers say that while she has been released in an honest word so that she can undergo a medical procedure abroad, it is not clear on the terms of her release whether she will remain at liberty until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say that she is now appealing to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court’s order.
“The Supreme Court has rejected Shaykh Hasina’s bail application, saying he does not need bail when he is already conducting an investigation abroad for an honest statement,” said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We appeal against the rules of the Supreme Court."
Her lawyers said she needed bail to be able to return to the country from abroad because of preparations for the December elections.
The League’s senior representative said Shaykh Hasin was due to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the army-held provisional government took over, but was released from prison in June so that she could go abroad for medical treatment.
Shaykh Hasin and Khalid Zija both reject all charges brought against each other.
Fear of Vaccination of Arms in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated against measles due to the violence associated with the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations conducted vaccinations in six provinces.
However, she says that for security reasons, she could not reach children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
The U.N. spokesman said that despite the Taliban's pledge, it would not attack or prevent thousands of vaccine workers from working.
BSkyB loses court case over ITV
BSkyB has lost the dispute over the review of the Commission’s decision on competition, which the company has ordered to reduce its share in the competitive broadcasting of ITV.
The BSkyB Competition Appeal Tribunal has ordered that it reduce its share of ITV from 17,9 % to 7,5 %.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB’s share had a competitive edge and had a disproportionate impact on ITV.
BSkyB bought a stake in 2006 in a store that as a result prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Authority announced that BSkyB’s acquisition of a stake in ITV led to doubts about ITV’s independence and called on the Commission to launch the investigation.
The head of the Virgin consortium, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer organization and regulator of Ofcom, were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its share in ITV was disproportionate and disproportionate - especially because BSkyB had previously said it was willing to give up its voting rights.
A new investigation into the case of U.S. lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
Tah came in a situation where the report on the affair prepared by the top inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report was criticized by White House officials, lawmakers and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzalez.
The investigation was prompted by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials of the hearing during the investigation lied to the investigators with the aim of measuring justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine stated in the report: “The serious allegations, including potential criminal acts, have not been fully investigated or explained.”
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to pronounce was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice dismissed nine U.S. lawyers in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said lawyers had been released because of poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the dismissal of lawyers was not rated any worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the dismissal was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, while others refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud brought against the Democrats.
U.S. attorneys investigate and file lawsuits in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, got under fire for letting go and eventually resigned.
A number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report on Gonzalez's role in the affair was very critical, saying he was "principally responsible" for letting go, that he "abdicated" from his leadership position and was "not remarkably involved" in the incident.
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, have been criticised for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's Pride Will Be Awarded
The rock star Meat Loaf receives one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will attend the ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold prize, said he was "honored" by the recognition he received.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year’s nomination is led by Coldplay, a group that has been selected in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, said: “There are some songs that stand above such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed the big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It began the instrumental part, which lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK in 1979 as a single and peaked at number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell remained on the chart for about nine years and sold more than forty million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, and in 2003 he was also operated on due to irregular heart rhythm after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, he was forced by acute laryngitis to cancel concerts.
Later, it turned out that he had cysts on his vocal cords.
Obscur<0xC3><0xAD> street, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other land-based communications, some famous, others only useful.
But even many taxi drivers-veterans and long-time locals have trouble finding Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
This small street is in East Village district and leads north from First Street – without getting to Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it is more like a dusty passage than a traffic lane.
There are no cedules with street names.
In the usual atlas, it is practically invisible.
Still, he has an admirer's street.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
Extra Place wants to relaunch and create a cleaner passageway to the shops and boutiques that are to be opened in new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say that they were charmed by a shortened street simply because it was one of the last remnants of the time before the block was bred.
However, the City’s Office for the Protection and Development of the Building, which has a street in its power, has no interest in keeping it.
At the meeting of the municipal land committee, representatives of the city authority and Avalon Bay company planned a plan, according to which the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, Community 3 district manager, the committee favours such a variant when the streets will remain in the city’s hands and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns only very few land, and we would like the Extra Place to remain in its possession," she said.
"There could be proposals for repair and administration, which Avalon could do, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wants to retrace a small street and set up a seating area, several of which would be used by a cafe whose interest in renting space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily want to own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to repair this abandoned alley and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale was designed by the city.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Office for the Preservation of Buildings, said the city really wanted to sell the street, and said that his office's job was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthor's large farm was divided among several of his children and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
The back door of CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, led to Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as a photo backdrop on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
“The place was amazing,” says Danny Fields, manager of Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of waste, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, sheets and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the smelting of the East Village neighborhood, are pitted against the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that that piece of public property, albeit modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - an almost unchanged part of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah’s Missing New York (with the subtitle “The Book of Nuts: A Poorly Nostalgic View of the City in the Process of Dying”), hung up a part of the story about Extra Place from the section “Mluvme on the City,” which appeared in The New Yorker’s 1952 newspaper The New Yorker.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow blind alley, dark even during the day, and bounded by the rusty iron doors of the warehouses and locked windows, where a week of old newspaper breaks through the rubble."
With only a few exceptions, the street of a recent evening looked exactly the same.
The crash took place across the blind end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, where today’s expensive clothing store stands.
There was a graffiti on the walls, and next to a fresh dose of newspapers, there was an empty bottle of beer.
A few people around said that he rarely thought of Extra Place, but suggested that he might have some reluctance.
On the other hand, Fields said that he thinks that some people underestimate the effectiveness of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in the dark, wet, and repulsive places."
Debate on bilingualism: immersion in English
In this issue, Focused on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the candidate’s stance on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic in California and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book “Better Than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools.”
Effectively speaking to Spanish voters is a horrendous matter.
Barack Obama’s education agenda only proves this.
Obama’s campaign points out that “African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to get there than white students,” which is true.
In order to combat such performance differences, Obama’s educational agenda is promoting, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for those who are just learning English.
However, the question remains whether Barack Obama’s commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter primary school in the Los Angeles East district.
The students of this school are in the vast majority of cases Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are still learning English.
Nevertheless, in the state tests of mathematics in 2008 it reached the highest level of the incredible one hundred percent of fourth-grade students.
Almost as amazing as ninety-three percent of fourth-grade students got to the highest level in the state tests of English language and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by a method other than that preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and exercise, continuous assessment of abilities, and unexcused access.
Further, and that should be noted, according to Linda Michaels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s pedagogical approach for those who are just learning English is “total immersion.”
English immersion underscores the almost predominant use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, told me: “We had a huge success with one completely new student from Mexico – after 12 months you would go into class and not know what it is.”
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take the school as the Sixth Street Prep as a model of what other schools should look like with large shares of Hispanic and English-speaking students?
The results achieved by the school should make the answer to this question obvious, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Educational Association is a long-standing advocate of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for the division of bilingualism.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter when he said that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, “you should make sure your children speak Spanish,” he said.
If Obama really wants to eliminate performance differences, he should rather think carefully about the educational patterns that work, than laugh at them and trivialize them.
Oil is falling sharply due to renewed economic concerns.
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of fears that even the U.S. plan to save financial markets would not have to revive the economy.
Oil prices fell by 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in early trading on the New York Commodity Exchange.
Since last Monday, prices have dropped by more than $20 a barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street and also by two strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, earlier this month the price dropped to almost $90 per barrel, which in turn jumped to the wave of huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
Worry once again shut down investors on Monday, even after the Congressional presidency announced it had reached an agreement on the weekend on the biggest bailout plan in history.
This report has been shaded by fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the ongoing breakdown, the government announced that Citigroup would buy Wachovia Corporation’s banking division.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the furious weekend negotiations, which led to the economy’s bailout plan, “show themselves unable to revive the mood in the market.”
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The prospects for global stock markets, interest rates and currency exchange rates have been severely depleted," analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a report to investors.
"We don't think commodities will be able to escape the infection.
From a commodity perspective, our greatest concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread to the whole world, and especially to China.”
Analysts at this bank reduced their expectations for next year, as oil consumption fell due to slower growth in the economy, and they lowered their 2009 gas price forecast by about 20 %.
The wild ride in the second quarter surpassed the team's record
After spending more time in the Jets than anyone else in the last eight seasons, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a no-deal game into a spin-off ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals faced the grim clouds above each other in their painstaking game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranouse Colese on a twelve-yard touchdown sprint, perfectly marking the afternoon in which their gradually developing cooperation moved a mile ahead.
Favre sent Colese in this quarter after another two touchdowns, including the one in which cornerback fell, and another 10 seconds before the half-game.
"It was nothing extraordinary," Favre said of all his recordings to Coles.
“He’s a damn good player.
It’s been great for us, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were married, the defense attacked quarterback Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a stray horse and returned it by 32 yards to the touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith typed another recording and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens donated Warner to fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best.
The Cardinals got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal from the field, winning the lead 34-0.
That's the most the Jets ever won in a quarter.
The Jets coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe this madness, said, "Second quarter, or third quarter?"
When he was told that both – the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer – Mangini said: “I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third.
A lot of points fell in a short time."
Resting Gebreselassie has improved its world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him to be the best long-distance runner at all when he broke his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first man to run a 26.2-mile-long race and a two-minute race under him.
With a win on the pleasantly flat track at 2:03:59 he overtook his previous time of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, 35, made the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - he surpassed the world record or is at least the world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie left the Olympic marathon in Beijing because he feared - perhaps too scared from a backward glance - that the polluted air would upset his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions – sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish line – he won on Sunday in Gebreselassi with a lightning-fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya focused on the longer track, the marathon record fell by more than two minutes in the last decade, from the time Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's win, Gebreselass told reporters he had a seizure two weeks ago and left the training week.
The break obviously inspired him rather than delayed.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was in a bit of a doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - especially in Kenya, East Africa's rival Ethiopia - for saying he over-planned his races, generally avoiding the world's marathon tops, relying on the drivers as if it were a race on track, and a stopover.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie’s enormous running quality.
Maintained at the pace of four Kenyans, Gebreselassie scored in the half in a time of 1:02:04.
The two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, were constantly chased by Gebreselassi.
A little earlier than three miles before the goal, Gebreselassie last picked up and escaped to Kwambai, who then took second place at 2:05:36 and improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in a time of 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikit<0xC4><0x9B>nkov<0xC3><0xA1>, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a citizen of Germany, finished the excellent year with the seventh fastest time in the history of 2:19:19:19.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paul Radcliff from the United Kingdom.
Sixty-year-old Mikit<0xC4><0x9B>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> surprisingly won last spring at the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
The Beijing games were abandoned for something described as a back injury, but it recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon it ever ran improved its personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race smartly and thoughtfully: she let the four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners escape into the big jump, and then she reached them after about 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second at 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop from Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
The Pride and Obstacles of Black Lives in a Separate City
Hidden among the vast amusement parks of Greater Orlando, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy and huge, lies a quiet city in which the pride and difficulty of African-American life resonates.
Eatonville, the first completely black town to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three croquet fields, three hundred brown skins, three coats of bark, three coats of bark."
Now it's a travel spot.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Eatonville Festival to honor Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city, which she described, remains a party, although it has made a stop for tourists by including him in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project of the era of economic crisis.
He is still as independent, dignified, and private as he was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often withdrew and did not share their real feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what's coming."
Even today, in the year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open discussion of races, many of the people here remain wary of the views of foreigners.
“We pay great attention to how our story is told,” says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of the Negro uprising and a community of almost 2400 people, where the poverty rate is double that of the national average.
It is a centre of literature, but also a dub, a shadowed example of South African rural black culture – sometimes repressed, sometimes praised – that originated from American slavery.
It's not too surprising that the people here are both proud and protective.
And the concerns about Eatonville's idea really started with Zora, which is the only way the Hurstons are called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heart-pounding books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
The five sections of the Florida tourist guide turned the city a short distance to Route 17, which leads through the often overlooked center of Florida, on the stage of black history and human drama.
With the sound of a big drum in life and literature, Hurston introduced readers to the store of the first Eatonville mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"To the left of the road," she wrote, "is a white brown decorated modern national school with well-maintained courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, even though he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned the new husband of Dash's widow and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits into the hour hotel."
So, in just a few hundred words, Hurston’s Eatonville connected herself with self-government, but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
This was clearly not a typical Fodor's publishing house.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"She said it the way it was," says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls who made Hurston immortal by feeling men singing their beautiful songs.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
At Hurston, she is still remembered here as a cypress outpost, which often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin recalls that most of the time when she joined the city, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoked and wore pants in the city, which is still proud of her dignified dress.
The majority of the population was fascinated, Franklin said, but many were flattered.
"The people of Zora always liked to see," Franklin said.
But, he added, hovering on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were taken out of print.
It seemed that Eatonville had forgotten about her along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, present-day Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she previously lived.
There were no major mourning ceremonies or large public readings in Eatonville.
“I don’t think they understood her significance to the world or her reference at all,” said Valerie Boyd, the author of Hurston’s autobiography “Wrapped in Rainbows,” published in 2003.
The change came in the 80s of the 20th century.
Representatives of Orange County wanted to stretch the city's five-lane highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-lane main road.
The disintegration of Orlando has already pushed Interstate No. 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still getting out of a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for the mixing of races brought hatred to the forefront of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white guys, they came in and threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting on the side," Franklin said.
"In fact, we had a lady who killed it.
They were walking from the car to the melon."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s demand for forced integration and its decision in Brown’s case against the Board of Education stated that “it is offensive to my race rather than celebratory.”
Residents now claim that the disintegration of schools, although positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the young people there.
"Black children were used to hug - I remember that - you hugged your teacher in the morning, hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group Preserve the Eatonville Each Community.
This lasted until the teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
“You don’t embrace your white teacher because your white teacher — I mean, there’s a cultural barrier,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create a space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, rose above prejudices with low-minded self-esteem and quotes such as "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker traveled to the unmarked grave of Hurston and began to fight for the revival of her reputation.
Five years later, Hurston's acclaimed biography of Robert E. Hemenway came to the shelves in bookstores, which he re-incorporated into the American canon.
The highway project arrived just at the moment when Eatonville’s most famous daughter found the lights of the ramp again.
The former neighbors of Hurston now considered her a savior.
To show what could happen to its highway, the community began planning the 1988 Hurston Festival.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return to the celebration.
After a few years, the state withdrew from the highway proposal.
"These five currents of the highway have risen, you would say that it has been directly fired, a real civic pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd said it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped change the image of the city.
Outsiders such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the local church in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
The new one-storey library (named after Hurston, of course) was opened in 2006 on the newly-fabricated and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando can sometimes act as a dead end in summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Today it is 90% black.)
With strangers who come looking for the story and meaning of Eatonville, it is still often treated with caution.
Permission for most interviews is required to have in advance and certain things - such as murals in the oldest Eatonville church, painted by whites and depicting blacks in the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher who likes to sit in red, are still worried that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston Festival increased, domestic pride also increased.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse and as proud, creative, hardworking, crazy and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
From Franklin’s son-in-law, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, a heartfelt love for the village is echoed when he plans to return to Eatonville after high school to work in the local government or the police, which he says would benefit from some help.
And even younger, such as eleven-year-old twins from Alondra’s Winter Park and Alexia Kenonov, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just walk through here, think, 'Hm, this town is nothing against the others,'" said Alondra Kenon recently after Sunday's church.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we're all talking financially.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from newspaper stalls and turned TV screens on Times Square, they wouldn’t have realized they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never have wished that in the bee-hole of the office over their heads every day bankers and managers of the investment funds that monopolize New York, the worst “bad day in the office” since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still waving metal trolleys along the sidewalks and transporting muffin bakers to breakfast.
The Spaniards are still moving between the towers and wearing, like human mules, fifty burned shirts hanging from the waddles on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in the front for their morning bagel at the street food stalls, and it is still not possible to get a yellow cab on the day of the week between the fourth and seventh afternoons.
It didn’t look like a crisis at all, until I, with all the pessimism, decided to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Despite the fact that I was scheduling this task to cover up with a late afternoon siesta at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about twenty people on the front line.
Not in front of the boxed windows to pick up or deposit cash, but in front of an intersection where older customers order checkbooks, tourists are asking for a way to trade Macy’s mixed goods and new customers are setting up accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason as me.
However, compared to me, they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They chose money from so-called “thrifts” (a bit like building savings), money associations, and from those types of savings banks, whose branches operate only in one state, and who claim to care for their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have been quietly bankrupt.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion bank, went into bankruptcy, and when New Yorkers returned home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, tried to catch the rescue buyer.
The employees of the offices and shops that stood in front of me and were afraid of another collapse moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe harbor and that makes most of the savings on Wall Street.
Over the past week, New Yorkers have learned a lot financially.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the bankrupt bank, and to her top-ranking executive, Dick Fuld, with such familiarity as a sledgehammer.
And Lyn, the uniformed about fifty-year-old home of my agent, changed the theme of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I now have my savings in money market funds.
I moved it, I'm not going to risk it."
Muslim graves desecrated after Austria's right-wing split
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Austrian right-wing Libertarian Party and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, took part in the demonstration, which was presented in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 by the organisation "City against Islamization".
They carry cedules similar to traffic signs that show mosques crossed by a red line.
Police have accused right-wing extremists of insulting a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend, in which far-right parties made huge gains in the general election.
Over 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun, near Linz, were destroyed sometime between Friday evening and this morning, and the police are convinced it was an organized action.
The culprits have leaned on some graves of Jewish symbols such as the Star of David, but detectives are convinced that it may have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear if the incident was linked to the election.
A spokesman for the Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of disenfranchisement that comes as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan nears its end.
In the meantime, Austria is entering the search for its own soul after the traffic jams in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
Both far-right parties, which won more than 30 percent of the vote, the Free and Alliance for the Future of Austria, led a vehement anti-immigration campaign and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the chairman of the Free People’s Party, who won more than 18 percent of the vote, protested the campaign against cockroaches and burqas, and even expressed his opposition to the food that is perceived as a relationship with Islam.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke about the "European Brotherhood", which is intended to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets and argue that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have placed the extreme right in the position of the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that this change has been caused primarily by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad.
Gary Glitter, a glam rock star who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, has been barred from traveling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed the six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the monitoring authorities that he plans to travel via France to Spain.
The travel ban was approved by the Kent Police last Thursday after it provided officials with evidence of Glitter's past convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, by his own name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
On Thursday, 25 September, at Ashford’s lowest criminal court, Kent police asked for a regulation that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally involved.”
64-year-old Glitter informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, as recorded in his sexual assault record.
They must notify the authorities if they wish to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also submit the planned date of departure to the police a week in advance.
If the obligation to inform the authorities was waived, he could be sentenced to five years.
The Kent police have announced that they will not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible roads through the district.
A Kent police spokesman said: "Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to track someone who will stay in the UK, because here we have extensive systems that manage the potential danger more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for the Kent Police and we are working carefully to monitor the behavior of recorded sexual attackers in order to minimize any danger to the public."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him pass the passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On 22 August, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there, while his legal representative David Corker went to the Uxbridge Least Criminal Court in West London and at the same time Scotland Yard successfully requested an order to register him.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months for possession of child pornography.
A source from the interior ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, was calm and pleased that Glitter had been prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I photograph the master outside the scene." G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer - photographer
No panties, no bells, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, separated from the focus on interpretation - that is the only way to achieve the relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
An artist on one side.
Second, a man.
Indecisive, if we forget privacy, in those moments away from the audience - then you can see a confidential gesture, the depth of the view captured in flight, or passionate hand gestures that are carefree, because they do not go out on stage.
Germany's G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer replaces in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of performing with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer composes a unique iconography of flamenco from different environments.
The exhibition, which takes place within the program of the Flamenco Photography Month (Mes de la Fotograf<0xC3><0xAD>a Flamenca), "reflects the ever-growing international significance of flamenco", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people, but when you look at the typography of the
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy... and completely capture the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
It carries its personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that allows me to capture the personality of the great flamenco.
Enthralled by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey of portraying flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a disc camera.
They are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical basis of the picture and lends it to the contemporary spirit, which is an idea that, according to Bauer himself, also mirrors flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, which, however, does not cease to surprise and develop."
What strikes the audience is not the act of dancing, singing or playing, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we meet the most essential, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, was and is the constant of the work presented during these days in the Gallery of El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata.
This selection of nearly seventy photographed artists is made up of famous flamenco figures, such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of flamenco anthology and soon there will be a book edition, which will contain exposed portraits.
Two years ago, Bauer’s passion for portraiture led to the idea of repeating the idea on “Portraits of Sports Veterans” (“SportARTproject”).
Although their concept is different from "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "to photograph people, to get to know them and to have the opportunity for a moment, be it longer or just short, to enter into their lives - that's my passion.
I think in photography, a portrait is the most difficult genre.
A person encounters or encounters people, personalities they sometimes don’t even know, or they give him just a few minutes to take a photo.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
A collection of portraits of the current flamenco with the name "Flamenco-people" is on display at the Galerie El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata in Calle de la Mata 20, parallel to Alameda de Hercules, and can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa admits that the novel he writes is "trustworthiness."
He plays in an environment he does not yet know, and tells about the events for him unknown, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully realize his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who also lived in the Congo.
The eternal favorite of the Nobel Prize for Literature was admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project he is currently working on is "credibility" and that "everything is proof that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had reason, I wouldn't do it, but I'll do it, and I believe I'll finish it one day," he concluded his contribution to the festival of exchange of ideas, ideas and words, which in four days saw in the city of the aqueduct about a hundred other writers, historians and novices.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the celebration of the word and met expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" - filled the Juan Bravo theatre to the last place.
with Félix Rome, who introduced him, had before him a dedicated audience, an hour of inspiration like water - a Peruvian with amazing accuracy and a nocturnal dose of humor remembered in him from the original "unbelievable adventure", an "enthusiasm of a passionate reader" and an "enthusiasm of a poet"
The Spanish-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to figure out whether and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just a fun, a fleeting experience" - Vargas Llosa emphasized that he "sold out" and that he was "sold out of his mind"
Due to climatology, the celebration in Pozoblanca is lost - missing kopi
The performance with the cops, which closes the ceremony in Pozoblanca, was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement of the performers that the surface of the square is not in good condition.
Therefore, along with Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the company decided to cancel bullfighting matches.
Unfavourable weather conditions have plagued this festival for a long time, and two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, it made it impossible for the rain to pass through the other planned bullfights.
During this time, the formations of José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista were to be built for the bulls in the arena at Castilblanca.
This is how it was celebrated only on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and the reward for a dynamic and aesthetically high-quality performance was put on his shoulder.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two wounds with spears for greetings and one ear, which brought him rather unhidden seats in the arena than toreador art.
Even worse, El Juli, who passed through the bull arena of Los Llanos, was sent an impostor.
In the second round of the drill without a single breath, he earned a sharp criticism from the majority of the audience.
They took control of <0xC3><0x81>lava in a shipment of two thousand kilograms of hashish
In ten minutes, five.
Road control of Ertzaintza in Armin<0xC3><0xB3>n (<0xC3><0x81>lava) district.
Members stop two people driving in the van, and those driving them.
The load, more than two tons of hash, is not to be stopped.
According to a report by the Interior Committee of the Basque Government, members of the Basque government have pursued and detained one of the persons driving in the supply, a 38-year-old man who was identified as A. A. J.
He was accused of smuggling drugs and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out a road inspection on the N-1 at the places where it crosses the border of the Armin<0xC3><0xB3>n urban district.
They were going to stop the delivery for the purpose of checking, but the driver did not obey the instructions, hurried and caught.
The car’s occupants immediately began to race when the vehicle stopped at the edge a few miles away, at which point both passengers jumped out and fled into the wooded growth.
Ertzaintza finally caught one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects were carrying, as revealed during the Iveco Daily’s inspection of the supply.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with packages of hashish, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and weighting of the drug.
In addition, the police found that the identification mark is "smashed" and does not agree with the data stated in the delivery documents, the detainee was therefore also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the drug.
The 28-year-old detainee, A.A.J., was transferred to the police department to handle appropriate formalities before later embarking on another investigation.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, a favorite Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for drug-induced driving.
The witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers as she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the People magazine told the California Highway Patrol.
The witness said that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear “walked in the gas, walked in front and back for a loud bang and tried to get out of the parking lot – she passed the sunglasses several times during the swirling.”
The witness, who didn’t recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear for a moment after stopping on a nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the rescue service because "she was afraid of the life of Locklear."
When a police officer arrived at the scene, she found an actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the vehicle.
"She looked disoriented," and so she was taken to a specialized drug and alcohol center to undergo the test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress was cooperating and excessive amounts of alcohol were soon ruled out, however, "we think Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was visible to the guards at first glance."
Locklear was detained on suspicion of being administered under the influence of effects of a more closely unspecified substance and was taken into custody at around 19.00, although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a medical clinic, where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges Andalusian IU association to exercise its powers in Silva case
The head of the IU and a member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that the final decision in the case of the former City Council Youth and Sports Councillor in Seville, Francisca Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after being accused of treason, will be sentenced
"I'm an over-federalist, it's up to the Andalucian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares said in a speech the party will have to take action against a former member of the Seville City Council.
However, the head of the IU insisted that in the case of an investigation of the illegal conduct that Silva had committed, it was absolutely necessary "transparency": "the IU always fought for such matters to be as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
"Blood of May" ('Sangre de Mayo'), Garci's epic bet
José Luis Garci in the film "May's Blood" (Sangre de Mayo), which he was inspired by episodes from the national past of Benita Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, revives the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French - this is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of 15 million.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "draw the expressiveness of the characters and the analysis of the society", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, today explained together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paulo Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a during the presentation of the film before a large team of interpreters.
May's blood with a two-and-a-half-hour footage will be shown in theaters this Friday and more than a four-hour TV series is set to air in the future.
As a great admirer of the literary work of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Garci claims that by filming this film he will have fulfilled the "children's dream", which is thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him to shoot the film in the Autonomous Province of Madrid, the 2nd anniversary of the birth of the <0xC3><0x89>v<0xC3><0xAD>d<0xC5><0xAF>d.
The budget of 15 million, which was completely contributed by the province of Madrid, means for Garci a "unique opportunity" to create an environment with backdrops and costumes corresponding to the image of "third-party Spain, which was wrong in the leader, for whom the fight was not to be fought.
The director regrets, however, that he cannot count on the financial support given to the films Sad Wing (Ala Triste) or Goy's Ghosts - almost twice as much as May's Blood - so he could not shoot some scenes from the script signed by a villain, also by a villain named Horac<0xC3><0xA1>.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and Empezar) works as usual - on stage together with the actors he usually tries before filming and who does not choose casting, because he thinks it's "humiliating" and also thinks that he's getting "sucked in"
Many of the actors he chose for the Blood of May appear before his camera already several, such as Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci with four Oscar nominations, one of which won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the Seven Tables of the French Billiards and the last selected blindfold, are wearing a veil
Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a does not expect any awards for this film.
“At first you think you’re working for what’s next, but then you realize you’re only working for a profit, so you’re going to be tempted to make one more movie,” Garci explains with more than 30 years of directing career.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n revives the spiritual connection of Seville dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
The flamenco dancer from Seville will give up the team of other Seville dancers.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, from the father of Catalonia (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and mother of Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valencia Valencia), was born in Triana district, and when she was three years old, they moved with their family to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dance.
She lived a life full of passion, she pioneered female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought for the abolition of the corset, which prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe was enchanted by Isabele Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "it's not about telling her life, it's about capturing the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So the "dance of a butterfly" evoked a guajira or a "dance of a snake" some tangent.
Her dance was meaningful and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic also corresponds," she says.
The performance involves two exceptional personalities: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabele in one performance as well as in the "Open Doors" (La puerta abierta), and with dance teacher Matilde Coralova, who made an exception and joined the band.
"Matilde represents the older Tortola, the mature figure.
I am happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honor for me.”
The performance also includes the music and guitars of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paca Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, El Pulgy and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; the drums of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jara, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of Juanfry Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, "who have the role of an eternal guide to them, who are in the works of art".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who played at her time in such distant places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, as she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at some point in time, but today no one knows her and even less appreciates her work,” Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n says.
The show starts today at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vegy Theatre.
The book "The Diary of a Freshly Married Woman" also concludes the triennial
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of "The Journal of the newly married" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at the site where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government (the "Tr<0xC3><0xB3>bié" and the "Tr<0xC3><0xA1>veli<0xC3><0xA1>na")
The "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n" is about to end with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, a renovation of the Nobel Museum and a travel exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: The Sun's Beacon, the New Yorker's Beacon", which was opened in the
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia also ordered eight hundred copies of the “Diary of the newly married” edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread awareness about the personality and work of one of the world’s most famous Andalusian poets.
America Without Paul Newman Doesn't Like It Anymore
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "Without a Bad Will" and, under the weight of awareness that Newman has left, reveals his unhappy vision of abandoned American cinema and the whole of America.
Look how long it took them to get the Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And that he knew he was seriously ill.
Yet he was a boy to all.
“Sometimes what one feels cannot be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend,” Robert Redford said in tears, “my life and my country have been better because of him.”
No one was afraid he would be ridiculous or overreacted.
The father of the film and the country has died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-confidence is at the bottom, when desperate reasons for pride are sought.
When time is rough and people without dignity and only a handful of those who are worthy of their admiration – there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for lost and lost cases, from a drug addiction foundation based on the honor of his first-born son, who died of overdose, to his own brand of home-grown food and bio-food.
A complete treasure trove for a country that took a lot of effort to break free from a suicidal eating culture.
The storming wave of admiration flooded Hollywood, regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man had died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, an Oscar-winning director, Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was an unsurpassed culmination of his career.
The evil boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has convinced Newman to call himself his greatest source of inspiration.
“This fox has set a pretty high bar for all of us,” says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live as Paul Newman did today – relying on honesty and leading a serious private life away from the camera.
It’s not always easy, sometimes even possible, in today’s media jungle.
But fortunately such people are, and Paul Newman is their model.
He got divorced once, and since then he has been married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although he had more than enough opportunities not to.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a filet at home?" he joked.
Let him be carried by pride in heaven that there is a reconciliation between his daughters and admirers on earth - it is not too common in America.
It is said that “out of all the great roles he has embodied, he was most proud of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a sacrificial philanthropist.”
The Imperfect Races at the Olympics in Madrid
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after the failed 2012 it will be 2016.
But I ask myself: are we ready?
If we're going to run yesterday's race, I'm saying, no!
It was talked about as a perfect race, and according to my court, it was the worst I've ever been on.
Such a dream of nonsense, that as soon as it had been evaluated and I was a tester, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let’s look at it from the beginning, one after the other.
The nonsense starts with picking up the race number, which is why a person has to leave early.
That doesn’t seem bad to me, but when a person is already there, let them give him everything (including a chip to prevent overfilling the track).
But no.
Here one had to pick up the number first (the first nonsense, go there only because of it) and (after standing up the appropriate front) - what a surprise! - they only had a T-shirt size S (the second nonsense, because I need size XL).
Where do we live?
That's because of the crisis they decided to buy only small T-shirts, because it's less fabric and they're cheaper?
All right, well, that's a small thing compared to what happened on race day.
In addition to having to go very early for the chip and the front on it took over 15 minutes, he still had to give up his backpack there.
Over 35 minutes of waiting time, which is at the race, where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as you might expect, the race started and we haven't put off the bags yet, and when it did, picking up was much worse.
In addition, the wait extended by 40 minutes of rain, which led to a general riot and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have inflammation of the intestines tomorrow and some, like me, will not be shown the right time to evaluate the results because of the chip they gave me and which, as I suppose, did not record the right start time.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, I wouldn't think of this one.
And so I think we're going to have to think about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Conference on New Technologies, Microsoft presented further developments in the new system of image recognition and human interaction in a way of artificial intelligence – not too intelligent, but able to perform basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a company that would move around and move around)
Thanks to the camera and the system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can find out how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen to and understand the key words of their conversations.
It is also able to classify the present according to the conversational groups.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist records a third person and understands that they do not belong to the group that speaks to her and that it is not an employee of the company.
She asks if she's going after someone and tells her she's going to do it in an instant.
All without the blue screen of death.
Exquisite.
But of course it is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things at work, such as a new version of Windows operating system.
There was a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft’s strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and won’t have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer concluded that if computers had only the most necessary things, without the burden of commercial waste, they would be five times more powerful — man, Steve, they would be cheaper.
Discover as a chrome when we consider that the Microsoft version from the version adds new features to Windows and another "extra".
A change of direction would be a worthy act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing meaning and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who subscribe to the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary, because it is a necessary layer to understand between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to the vagina.
That's true.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and, on the contrary, more to the Internet browser.
The computer turns on to run Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and every day we spend more time on the Internet than around windows.
What is the use of half of the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here's a small example.
I took this photo in one of the restrooms for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the vending machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the internet.
Last week, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let’s count to 2010.
At Microsoft, they will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Due to the fact that Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay a late fee.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the coast of Azure, Leonardo di Caprio in one shone in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond", as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppoly's "Kmotro", and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to let go of the calculation of his life roles, we can dive right down to the image of a typical swinger with a pointed elbow, which raises the stakes in the nocturnal circus.
Essentially, it is nothing more than a typical cotton men's underpants, sticky and sleeveless.
English speakers call him 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels excels above all others.
First of all, for his pen name - although popularly called 'Marcel' - which has something to do with sports because, as the legend says, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out over other high-quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive label and (almost inconceivable) Belgian flags, which have models of the most emblematic heels as a detail at the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian company does not specialize only in tank tops.
He also produces college mikiny, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy t-shirts, children's clothes, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for a comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother. Whoever is a father, I don't care."
The enormous image of her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz, though small, is a woman full of life.
Their new fashion appearance is now taken very seriously by Cruz's sisters.
For Monica, it means a lot more than just that some pretty, famous girls will lend their name.
In Paris, a promotional event, organized by Mango in its new headquarters, was also attended, as well as the announcement of the most important fashion awards sponsored by this Spanish company.
She's hearty and bold, and she'll get you close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we and Sister Penélope have designed for Mango this fall-winter season, and at the same time I attended the announcement of the second year "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentina.
It was a difficult but also an exciting day.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango, for which you are already working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love films from the 50s and 60s, and we’ve drawn a lot of inspiration from them.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walk in clothes, combine and layer their clothes, I do it very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything is connected and has a lot of connections.
I might have liked the clothes, I still wanted to go to my grandmother's, chat in my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
It was a sensation, almost better than going on a tour.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my clothes.
But you know that we dancers rely on how we're adjusted to make us feel good when we look in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, then you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for the designers and professionalism.
You're in your late 30s, you're in a crisis?
It's everywhere.
I feel better than I've ever felt before, 30's amused me.
I find that a woman is already ready, has experience, and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
Biological clocks don't scare me.
I am doing what I want to do, and it gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course I know that I will be a mother, because my body demands it, and besides, I want to be a young mother, I don't want to miss it.
When it comes to my father, I don't care.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a sense of happiness and raise him with great love.
As for the film, there are a few premieres of the films you made last year.
That's it, and I'm looking forward to seeing them in the movies.
I come from the theatre world, and so I am very impatient and restless, I want everything now and so of course it is not possible.
I'm looking forward to the premiere of "La <0xC3><0xBA>ltimo horas" and "En s<0xC3><0xBA>ca de la tomba de Cristo".
Agreed, how will you like them...
A couple of days ago, you had your premiere at a screening party by Naomi Campbell's side, didn't you?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to climb the pier as a model.
She just called me Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, and invited me to London to take part in the benefit screenings for her organization "Women for a Better Life", and the clothes we showed - I also chose two models from our collection for Mango - and pre-ordered the outfit.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
A lot of things are being said about her and I, as I know her, can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good he's engaged in.
She asked me to show for charity, but if she asked me to make a stand, I'd do it too.
For the sake of third world women, I will do whatever it takes.
Drivers repeatedly catching with alcohol in their blood will have to install an "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires a driver with three administrative sanctions for driving under the influence of alcohol to have to install a system in his vehicle that will prevent him from starting the car intoxicated or if he does not breathe.
The proposal was made public in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the High Representative of the Republic, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its goal is to return the drivers behind the wheel, so the drivers will also have to complete a transport retraining course.
In addition to the National Transportation Safety Authority, the General Directorate of Transportation (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 % of drivers accused more than once of driving drunk again in this state sit behind the wheel.
Alcoholock should prevent this, as it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breathable air and prevents the car from starting if the driver is not breathing before or if the alcohol concentration is higher than allowed.
His price is more than 1,000 euros and he would have to pay it himself.
A study conducted in this sense in the US in 2007 showed that in vehicles equipped with these devices, violations were reduced by 65% during the first year since the introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to resolve this behaviour before it results in a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, since legal regulation can be carried out in the usual way, the necessary modification of penal provisions requires a change of law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although in some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles it has already been installed experimentally.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on the proposal of the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses, as it is in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 5:40 p.m., as it stood in the program, an aircraft of the Spanish Air Force landed in the presidential hangar at the Benita Juarez Airport in Mexico City, where the Prince and Princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun had just set, but his rays still had to cover their eyes with their hands to see the next couple coming out of the plane.
Under the stairs stood the Spanish Ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that a Spanish prince and a princess were coming to visit the state.
- Yeah, that's great, that's not gonna get to the airport to pick up people... she's out of here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she's lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, well, that's...
The Mexican press, however, knows well who the prince and princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport near the red carpet and the military cordon, which is made up of 27 marines ready to fire an honest salvo.
The Prince appears with a smile on her lips in a dark-blue dress, and the princess, very rarely dressed and with loose hair, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that in D.F. there is a threat of a storm.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegations are waiting, they smile at the photographers and unwittingly shoot them.
At the door of the hotel, where they will be staying, one of the four largest in the city, a Mexican TV reporter is waiting for them.
Best-Supply Fashion Price
There is probably no more suitable place in the world to declare a fashion price than Paris and there is probably no more famous designer and bonviva than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second year of the El Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards to enable an international presentation of new talent in the field of fashion.
The price is subsidized by the amount of 300 000 euros.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoliov<0xC3><0xA1>, winner of the first year, looked at her designs yesterday at the Manga exhibition on Paris’ Haussmann boulevard No. 54 and almost cried with tears.
Certainly, it is the company’s second largest store in Europe and has just opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank the designers of Valentino for taking over the presidency of the competition jury, caused us to end up having a lavish dinner at the Paris Opera Garnier.
Mango’s festively decorated presidential table looked a bit more stunning next to Chagall’s most famous works.

1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about the chaotic and angry everyday life.
And in order not to be short, all are summarized in one book, which will bring the 30th of September to book shopping relaxation.
The alarm bells every morning at 7 a.m. as a punishment, but even worse is to imagine yourself immersed in the fast-paced rhythm that brings contemporary life.
The office is called the voltage and the computer pain in the back.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there is neither one nor two methods of combating the daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnecting from the world of work.
No, that number is nothing bigger and nothing smaller than 1001.
In addition to yoga postures, classical massages and spa therapy, Susannah Marriott’s collection of all the “menu” options on her book’s pages, adjusted according to the taste and timing of each individual.
The anti-stress book is called "1001 way of relaxation" and thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring peace to the bookstore.
If someone thinks that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, the "handbook" denies this opinion.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you no longer have adrenaline in your veins, which restores balance in your body, and stress becomes a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Speaking from sleep
Some children talk at night.
I don’t think those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may make you cry, but in fact it’s insignificant.
This is a harmless sleep disorder, which is called somnilochia.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure not one of you was told that he was talking about sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (e.g. once in a lifetime in high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a few months...), the second day the child does not remember anything.
There's not just one reason to explain her appearance.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as night sickness, night sweats, nighttime enuresis (night aid) or nausea, but this may not be the case.
As previously mentioned, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stressful or distracted situations.
In any case, this is a poorly studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak with a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (crystals, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where he appears with great force, it would be appropriate to observe and consult with a specialist to find out if he has any problem that causes great anxiety in him and in this way manifests himself.
We said it was a harmless disorder, so it is not treated unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do that by keeping in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to disturb the child too much before he goes to sleep.
So, look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV shows or TV shows or TV shows.
In very nervous children and those who can work to relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques, which will help them to get a certain inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
When a somniloquie appears, try to remain calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and that from what happened, the next day he will no longer remember anything.
Useful Advices
Don't be him.
It's unnecessary because he's unconscious and you're interrupting his sleep.
Even though he speaks, he sleeps, and thus rests.
Remember that if you think several times that you are very worried, it is advisable to turn to the advice or find out what causes such anxiety in a child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to listen to him and pull information from him.
It won’t be worth anything, because when he sleeps, he’s not aware that he can organize his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he thinks, and therefore why he says it, so pay close attention to how you interpret the information and what conclusions you come to.
Never tell your child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not funny, either.
That's causing a lot of anxiety.
Don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing, it’s just an episode that takes just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory again after a long period of thinness.
Without playing a particularly big game, the yellow-blacks created more chances and managed to turn one of them into a winner.
The game did not have too fast a pace during this clash, in which the attackers were only pushing hard.
After the first attempt, the captain of the host Kauffmann, who shot from a distance just by the hairs past the junction, began to have Illhaeusern slightly on top and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne by air, Romain on a long leg or also Diebold gradually came down the path.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wave in the half of the pitch and left only the agile Riahi at the top of the attack.
The beginning of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to Dannemarie's two chances named Riahi and Temporale, then after the opening of the score for Illhaeusern, which Marais took care of, well positioned for the processing of the ball reflected after the previous Diebol (53).
G<0xC3><0xB3>lman Illhaeusernu, however, did not enjoy the pleasure for a long time, and after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room and thus leave his fellow players to weaken.
Dannemarie, however, was unable to recover from this, and the eleven of Illhaeusern, who had retreated only a little to "tighten" the defence, no longer caused any more trouble, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball after a great bluff passed the ball.
Sarkozy Goes Ahead of Angry Fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a ride through Brittany.
To confront a demonstration of the strength of the fishermen, who on Monday strongly violated the access of several Breton and Norman ports, the French president decided on Tuesday morning to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re to meet with their representatives there.
The latter have promised to be adopted "in a constructive spirit", and hope to "come up with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the electoral meeting of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen in order to take action against the sharp increase in oil prices, which reached a peak exceeding an average of 1.14 euros per litre.
According to David Martinon, spokesman for the Elysee Palace, the president "will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions of employment and pay for sailors."
Nicolas Sarkozy is a fisherman expected with indifference.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out the operation "hlemy<0xC5><0xBE><0xC4><0x91>" (the operation of slow-moving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of congestion.
The recreational port in Quiberon was also blocked, but connections in the direction of Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le were not interrupted.
On the Quiberon Peninsula, a filtration dam was introduced.
The sailors showed their determination as early as Monday, when tyres and pallets were burning at the port of Brest and Lorient just before dawn, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, as to the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained in the port, or to Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the operation of merchant ships.
During the evening, fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until they decide to act on their own, at a ministerial meeting on Wednesday.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" is due to decide on Tuesday on how to proceed along the route and on its participation in the preparatory meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the State Fisheries Committee who did not support their movement.
“The stop will continue” because “fishers will not let anything go” and “they don’t want to go to Paris,” said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Fishermen who do not pay the oil tax are currently paying about 50 cents per litre, but consider that the ship's yield threshold is reached only when the oil is below 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman
An unforgettable representative of Butche Cassidy and Kida died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes have both embraced the film's legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its supply conditions for 2008
This year, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer relies on the supply of 215 aircraft, despite the threat of a recession that is looming over the world economy.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world, Embraer, maintains its supply requirements for 2008 with 215 aircraft added, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer has a lot of promise from the Chinese market, especially with a range of his aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers over a period of eight years.
AIG says it plans to allocate 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities received over the water, thinks it would allocate more than 15 percent of its assets in order to pay back the $85 billion it was given as a back-up, the Sunday edition of the Financial Times writes.
AIG is ready to investigate the sale of most of its non-life insurance activities in the international arena and pension activities in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to FT, AIG’s Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to examine possible progress.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory statements from AIG.
The assets AIG intends to dispose of include its subsidiary of the International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the insurance provider Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of real estate and private equity investments, FT adds.
No final decision on these procedures has yet been taken, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly get cash to pay off the $85 billion loan given to it by the Federal Reserve Bank with the risk that the U.S. authorities will rob it of 80% of its capital, while at the same time diluting it to the appropriate ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historic meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to save banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10 365.45 points.
The largest point decline in its history (684.81) was recorded on September 17, 2001, on the day of the resumption of trade following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq Index with the dominant technology component lost, according to definitive post-trading closing data, 199.61 points and stood at 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8,81 % (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
Locked down since the beginning of the session, Wall Street literally collapsed after an unexpected rejection of a plan to rescue banks by the House of Representatives, a plan that would allow for a bit of stability to be found again in the markets.
228 votes against and 205 for the representatives refused to provide the Secretary of State Treasury to Henry Paulson with the funds he requested.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“It’s a bad signal sent to a market that sees Congress not being able to adopt a certain plan,” said Lindsey Piegzaov of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, expressing concern that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late."
"If this project is indeed doomed to extinction ... the staff will be immediately handed over to the Fed and other central banks to ignite the crisis, which would further strengthen credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, head of Globalight.
With an emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States "every new day brings the downfall of a single financial institution".
After Friday's crash, Washington Mutual organized the Wachovia bank's bank activities with its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken a turn and called for urgent intervention in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are not "only facing the American crisis, but the global crisis," the FT analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
Income from the 10-year tax return fell to 3,632 % versus 3,827% on Friday evening, income for 30 years to 4,161 % versus 4,357% the day before.
Obama Wins Points in First TV Duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House, the second debate followed, whose task was to find out which of the two John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The ruling states of the Republican and Democratic campaign were not surprised when they both announced their victory in a television duel that was watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, however decent, was not “brilliant” enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a decline in polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll released on Saturday gives Obama a five-point jump (49% vs. 44% for McCain), says the Democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters that matter, Obama is the winner for 39% of those polled, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% assigns victory to McCain.
Obama is expected to be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday through the supposed good performance of his co-candidate, Joseph Biden, during the first and at the same time the only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be wrong to underestimate her.
It’s a gift,” Bill Clinton said over the weekend.
Seventy-one-year-old McCain has consistently raised his undisputed experience in foreign policy, while at the same time emphasizing his opponent’s “na<0xC3><0xAF>veness” in the issues that formed the core of the first clash.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." sounded a repeated accusation.
“I don’t think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to be president,” he said.
In such an aggressive spirit, they have been carrying themselves since yesterday's Republican TV show.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that he represents the future.
He did not lose his head, and he proved to be brief and precise.
He has raised his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
“McCain still didn’t understand, while Obama did,” he said at the weekend, a Democratic poll that told Republicans he wasn’t sufficiently concerned about the impact of the crisis on the “ordinary American.”
“During the ninety-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama told a gathering of 20,000 people at a pre-election meeting in North Carolina for the heavy rain.
He did not even pronounce the words as "middle class" or "working". The financial breakdown clearly favors Obama, whom the Americans consider more capable of saving the economy on the brink of collapse.
“Next week could be a decisive turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic transparency" to what Bill Clinton had during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current impeachment is “the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, how George Bush ran it, and how Senator McCain supported it.”
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that, despite the unexpected surges in Wall Street, he should be able to reduce the tax rate of 95 percent of Americans, and also noted that the realization of the country’s eventual energy independence by promoting renewable energy is a priority for him.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided questions regarding the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial aid plan, which was adopted by Congress last night and which is highly unpopular.
"What, did you notice that there were elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of polling stations in Minsk's main square to protest against the irregularity of parliamentary elections.
Although no results have been announced yet, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, demi-mission".
Some admit that they didn’t even go to the polls: “What would it be like to do with my voice as much as they want,” says one young man.
He does not believe that this regime, which has been welcoming to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to turn to democracy.
Sanctions, which include a visa ban for 40 Belarusian prostitutes and the freezing of some assets, could be lifted in the event that the elections are considered pure by the observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
“We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the voting,” said Juri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," emphasizes Alexandr Milinkievic, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and the leading figure of the pro-European movement, "because it's important who counts the votes, and in us it's executive power.
If any opposition MPs get into parliament, it will be by being appointed, not elected.
However, their entry into parliament can mean a space on television, a meeting in regions, and draft laws."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to take part in political action, because "a dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
If our economy, which is deeply indebted to Russia, collapses and we do not reform, it threatens us to become the protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which monitored the elections, will not declare the elections in force.
He stresses that the turnout appears to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"What about you, did you notice that there were any elections?" said Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was no foot in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones that best suit the regime."
The silence of the night once again took place in the October square.
On TV, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Interview - The blood that's sure again
Héma-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly delighted, as Héma-Québec became one of the most reliable and effective blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained public confidence, which was seriously shaken after the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the state blood reserve administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Board was contaminated with the HIV virus and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994, due to this drama and public outcry, the Canadian government launched a public inquiry, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and to formulate recommendations to prevent such a disaster.
While Judge Krever hesitated to deliver the report, a committee was set up in some provinces to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this role was taken up by the Gélinea Committee.
Following the Gélineau and Krevere reports, two suppliers were set up in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was to be administered by Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Company for the supply of all provinces and both territories.
“When Héma-Québec started its activities in 1998, only 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system,” Dr. Décary recalls.
“The situation was overwhelming.
With a systematic effort to increase the safety of blood products and constant work in this area over the following years, we have regained public confidence," he says, adding proudly that by the beginning of 2008, Héma-Québec already had confidence in almost 94% of the Quebec population.
Dr. Décary, however, does not lose sight of the fact that “trust is something very fragile.”
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
"At that time, we witnessed in Europe the occurrence of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, new variants of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease," says the woman, who has led the company since its inception in 1998.
"And we had no idea if this disease could spread blood.
We therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Kreverov and Gélineau report, according to which, in the event that we do not know and when there is a serious disease at the bet of spreading, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by the degeneration of the brain, does not cause death.
In April 1999, we therefore turned down blood from people who have been staying in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease is transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that it made sense to stick to the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting the HIV virus appeared on the market: tests using nucleic acid (NAT) that allow the donor blood to detect the presence of the virus itself, and not the presence of antibodies on which the pre-existing tests were based.
NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the deaf period that occurs between the moment of infection of the patient and the moment when the first virus can be detected in our blood techniques, explains the specialist.
We have been able to shorten this period to less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without them knowing about it and without us being able to figure it out.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
One in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
In other words, it means that before someone gets infected with HIV, 12 million blood products will need to be distributed.
Because Héma-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products annually, it will take 24 years for the first case of HIV transmission to appear through the blood product.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe blood transfusions that are necessary for healing,” said Héma-Québek, head of the department.
“The challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
We never know what disease-causing element can occur in the system.
Just last year, a chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by insect bites.
It is necessary to be constantly cautious," continues Dr. Décary, stressing that, in addition to the safe supply, Héma-Québec must also consider the supply sufficient.
“Requirements are growing because the population is ageing.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which on average is made up of only 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate."
Every healthy person is at least 18 years old, meeting the eligibility criteria, but can donate blood only once in 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer blood are not accepted because they are, for example, carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited a country where they order septic tanks, they are excluded for a period of one year.
“With these 3%, we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Disadvantages are very rare.
However, the members of the donor network need to be complemented in proportion to how old they are and can no longer donate blood.
However, convincing people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unconnected today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart palpitations, eye bulbs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank in Quebec’s umbilical cord.
The umbilical cord, previously considered a biomedical waste, sheds blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our 1,000 blood sample from the umbilical cord to the bank, and we expect to collect over 1,000 a year.
At the beginning of next year we should start offering them for transplants," explains Dr. Décary, who describes the blood collection program from the umbilical cord as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they don't have access to it," Héma-Québec doesn't have enough resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-final round of the USL first division, thanks to a 3:1 victory (4:3 is the goal-scoring balance after both games) in the quarter-finals.
Antonio Ribeiro scored a decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the two-sided goalless first half, backup David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan in favor of Sounders.
Recall that on Friday, during the first of the two games, Impact suffered a quarter-final defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in the Seattle suburb of 2:1.
The impact will be matched in the semi-finals with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder faced a 3:1 deficit in the home game and eventually won 4:3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless advanced to the semi-final round with a total of 5:4 goals.
The impact is expected to hit the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the match series will be confirmed until today.
In short - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadiens are ready to start the season.
The unit consisting of Alexe Kovaleva, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekance and Andreje Kosticina last night in Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win Canadien 3:2 on separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the clash, shot a goal, Plekanec collected two assists and Kovalev scored one touchdown in this fourth three-color victory out of six preliminary matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring a single goal during separate innings.
"I'm not ready yet," Russ said.
"I need another game to make me feel good."
"In the first third, he tried to do too much," said Guy Carbonneau.
“I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice accent."
Charest bet on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out early elections by the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party (Parti libéral) ended its session, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today’s supplementary elections.
"Remove the boundaries of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually compelling way at the conclusion of the Liberal Party's meeting in Lévis, without giving details.
During his speech, images were projected behind his back in some sort of image mill.
On three curved canvases there was a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from the view "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great resources, as in the pre-election period.
At a press conference, the prime minister declined to rule out early elections in the fall, although he warned that he had a very busy schedule.
The “North Plan” is the fourth dimension of the “vision” that the prime minister envisions for Quebec, a “new economic space” that includes an agreement with France on labor, a treaty between Canada and Europe, and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern territory on the 49th parallel - the prime minister has recently often mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North is a "major potential cloud", but did not specify the term, the amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At the very least, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further developed: in particular, water plants, forests, but in particular the mining sector, driven by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
North, according to Charest's calculation, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "territory is twice as big as France is with us", "is in Quebec.
And it’s not just with us, it’s with us,” he said, as if he wanted to show that he was calling for a certain national founding myth.
Quebec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, raised by the prime minister: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after he was theatrically silent to look at a huge map behind his back.
North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister said during a press conference.
“This is a traditional attitude that has been repeated by all governments so far.
There is a single boundary line, for which there is no longer a convention, and if there is an opportunity, in the name of the government, I will take this position again," he said.
Otherwise, “it is also necessary to rethink our vision for the North in the context of climate change,” he said, speaking of the North-West transition, which will open year-round as a result of the glacier surge.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that taking over the territory becomes an obligation.
And what about the inhabitants of the territory, the original nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government will be very attentive to them and that the project will be beneficial to them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequistic MP from Hungary), have already begun negotiations with about thirty communities.
The work was initiated by an inter-ministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier in which he holds an important position as Julie Bouletov<0xC3><0xA1> (Transport and Natural Resources).
The prime minister does not rule out a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "a common vision will be outlined".
The development of the North should be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he said.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as a gradual follow-up to the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our minds to turn the challenges into a new opportunity for growth and development.”
Such was one of the still-overwhelming themes of the weekend, which was launched on Friday by a large cocktail celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s accession to the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to cross Beauharnois's headquarters at the Adélard-Godbout dam.
“From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who carried out the Quiet Revolution and nationalization of water power, to the Bourass, who created James Bay, our party has managed to shape the future,” said Charest.
At the press conference, he appealed to another authority, this time conservative, namely to John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, which premiered from 1957 to 1963.
When the series came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric power station, Charest stressed that its launch is scheduled for 2012.
"I'm just saying it between us, but I plan to be on it," he confided to his member base, triggering a considerable applause.
The same prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and no doubt not even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling the elections in the fall of this year, which allows him the law.
However, he stressed that his program is busy, especially with the Federal Council’s missions in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend assembly provided the Liberals’ chief executive with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain “efforts to change the constitution” that went very smoothly: the PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) demands, in particular, recognition of the “specificity of Quebec” in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint a number of members of the Canadian Radio and Television Council who would have the right to veto decisions made in Quebec.
From the opposition side, the North Plan was skeptical in its main features.
The head of the PQ (Parti Québecois) Pauline Marois once again drew up the Northern Quebec Development Policy, which the Landry government launched in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, the implementation of this policy declined.
If she were to stick to it, “we would be going on today,” Marois would mark the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are held today) by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"But we are praying that it is not just a theatre," said Sébastien Proulx, the leader of Maria Dumont, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - The Cursed Land
It was Vic Toews, the former justice minister (on irony) in Harper's cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that he represents "a disgrace" to Canada.
So to sink a woman who has waged a relentless struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration, it tells a lot about the Prime Minister's environment and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that, as the only one of all the Western countries involved, has not transferred back to the homeland of its state official, who was imprisoned in the Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo concentration camp.
The government, which does not take into account the fact that, at the time when the acts were to take place, he was a young teenager, Omar Khadr.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing of the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves it to rot in the inhumane conditions of a child soldier.
The only one who relies on the parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and, in particular, the Association of Canadian Lawyers are defending the repatriation of Omar Khadra so that he can expect a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes to torture: it cares little about the fact that this young man is psychologically destroyed, and this undoubtedly persisted, after so many years of harassment.
We don’t realize it, but we are witnessing the plunging erosion of our rights, our freedom, and our “democracy,” the words that Harper is so fond of and that sound so empty out of his mouth.
The time has come when there is no morality left: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him badly, to imprison him according to the will of the head of the minority government so far (as will be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation on the side that proclaims Dignity, Law, and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made up the reputation and seriousness of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Barrick Gold's Orwell Discourse
In a September 17 issue, Le Devoir printed a letter from Patrick J. Garvera, executive vice president of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic confirms that the world’s largest gold producer has launched a lawsuit against three authors and a poor small publishing house for insulting honours in order to spark a “transparent public debate” and demands six million.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it does not judge the truth, especially in the case of a lawsuit for an insult to honor, but the law.
It's no surprise that Garver completely ignores this crucial resolution.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to conduct a public debate, to bring to the fore anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the case may be, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums to be prepared to defend themselves and fight in a highly unbalanced fight against an army of lawyers backed by the almost bloodless pockets of mining society.
Tactics in these unbalanced battles, among other things, often involve the destruction of the defendants in order to enforce a conciliatory procedure that shuts the mouth in the opposite direction and in addition frightens anyone who dares to commit the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have to present her view of the whole thing to the public.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada there is a debate over normal circumstances in the exchange of ideas, and not in the wounds of a shoe.
So it was not enough for the mining companies to open their books, their documentation, and forge a real debate through newspapers, media, publications, and funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole thing.
Barrick Gold, however, seems to have no confidence in public opinion and succinctly rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could demand a "public debate", while at the same time dismissing the views of the same public?
It seems that this word in the vice-presidential world refers only to heavily paid lawyers, and not to all Canadians; that is a rather narrowed concept of the term.
In a democracy, people have the right to speak up.
Barrick Gold does not understand – or does not want to understand – that the public, which supports authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of a mining company.
The public is prepared to listen to Barrick and judge the matter, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not within the framework of what many perceive as a lawsuit, in which the defendant is to be caught in the mouth (within the framework of his lawsuit "public debate" Barri
If we ignore Garver’s surreal expression, the lawsuit initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university’s freedom to investigate and seek the truth that is essential to any democratic society.
In general, it denies the right to quote reliable sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are not liked by the rich companies of this world without facing repeated lawsuits, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have created it if it were guided by the scientific standards that the authors of Noir Canada use.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s over-appeal clearly shows that despite what he claims, he does not have the slightest desire to have a transparent debate.
For the university world, this is a loss, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures that would limit this type of unjustified lawsuit.
Operation to Save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans Understand
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic bailout plan since the great crisis of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to curb the $700 billion financial crisis that has been haunting Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it foresees: better control of elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the payment of deposited public money, new measures to capture the number of houses confiscated due to non-payments and also the right to monitor the amount of rents paid.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Representative of the Republicans at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, after the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
“We have made great progress and have reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” said Henry Paulson, the Bush administration’s chief executive.
"Everything has been done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis just taking place on Wall Street," he said.
“That’s a crucial point: if we don’t, the trauma, chaos, and disruption of Americans’ daily lives will be huge,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
During the last few hours, the negotiations have run into maximum reversals of fear of the effect, which should be another failure on the mood of investors.
The time limit set was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the U.S. president were invited to the talks later, and both expressed their dissatisfaction with the fact that they had to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has agreed to supplement the agreement on some measures, particularly those aimed at enabling homeowners to retain their homes, and measures to pay the state-run labor-saving companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is no need to congratulate.
However, these measures are necessary,” he explained on the television waves.
His Republican rival John McCain, who was asked by another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
“The rough features that I’ve read [show] that it’s something that we’re all going to have to spend and with which it’s possible to move forward.
Choosing inactivity is, in short, unacceptable,” he said.
The 700-billion-dollar plan aims to buy out questionable receivables and risk and non-sale assets of U.S. financial institutions for taxpayers’ money.
The plan comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by a bubble burst in the real estate market, which first led to the collapse of risk mortgages (subprimes), then transferred to other, more extended forms of loans (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of cash and bank deposits.
The failure of the first draft of the agreement from last week is well known to the Republican MPs.
Since the Democrats have come to the conclusion that for some “toxic” assets of troubled companies, the government will only handle them, but will not buy them back, there is a conviction that the non-Eastern situation is fraught.
In an effort to bring conflicting views closer to Congress, a measure has been added that the government will be able to introduce new fees to help it recover its deposit if it is required to take over losses over a five-year period as a result of the program.
The new plan will include the deposit of the first amount of $250 billion, to which an additional $100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
A further <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will acquire stakes in the salvage companies, which in case of profit will pay him dividends and which will be able to sell again when it is all over.
The federal government will be able to delay the procedures for the seizure of the property associated with the loans to which the plan relates, as well as to set limits on the amount of assessment and compensation paid to the senior employees of the companies affected.
The plan’s proponents would like it to be put to the vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet clear whether their plan will have a green one.
Yesterday, the votes against this project continued to rise, both in the Republican and Democratic camp.
"It's absolutely clear that Washington won't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, said in a statement.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But making money on taxpayers is not the solution.”
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen dubbed the "sceptic committee", presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred distinguished professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to rush too quickly and carefully examine which way to go,” he said.
At the same time, Europe has reaffirmed that this crisis is a global crisis.
After the end of the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which has been on the verge of collapse since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in a coup d'état following a coup d'état.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, ranks among the 20 largest European banks and among the ten largest insurers.
"We're not going to talk about this money," Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
“In return, we get the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And it is precisely the directors and the household in today’s uncertain time that can appreciate it.”
On the other side of the Channel La Manche so far, it seems, the British government has begun nationalizing another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all of Bradford and Bringley’s existing loans, of which more than 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) were loans for the purchase of real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, the branches and accounts of clients of the British bank will be purchased by the Spanish bank Santander.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalized by the British government since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of Socially Engaged Icons
His beauty with azure eyes long represented his trump, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American actor fade away with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The stydiness, sensitivity, and unflinching talent that he possessed also distanced him from the power category that breeds real stars.
What a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 on his ranch in Connecticut due to lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American cinema.
Less magnificent than Brando, who was similar to him and had long been some of his rivals on film, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly a fragile but also an apostle of freedom and the breakup of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often gives birth to beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots was born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
Without exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because the whole country was in love with self-made mana, a warrior at war in the Pacific, wounded in the battle, who in the early 1950s studied acting at Yale, then visited New York's Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in theaters, in television and behind bars.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer who placed second at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, and at the same time a sexual symbol, despite having formed a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it also go the shady places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the habit of their own show-business, which will remain mysterious to some extent forever.
An obedient man, in the most sublime words of meaning.
Paul Newman’s departure this weekend caused a stir for film lovers, while his big role together rivals on the black canvas of memory.
After it, it has been defiling for more than half a century the ever-changing American seventh art.
A charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Cat on a Fired Roof, adapts to Tennessee Williams in 1958.
From a less ancient past (1990), we are endowed with his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled at an advanced age by a marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a poisoned, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean, taken over after his death, introduced in 1956 by Newman in real life.
Sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's stunning The Hustler (1961), the same character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, will bring him the only Oscar with seven nominations in 1987.
This face traveling ages, it was him.
And him again.
In his professional career, he competes with different eras.
He is best known for his iconic Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977) as Reggie Dunlop, a non-traditional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
He then closed his career with the Irish mafia's role in Road to Perdition by Sama Mendese in 2003.
Unlike several film legends that left the craft fairly soon, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, though he condemned Hollywood with his exploits, appearances, and setbacks.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, to be "a living challenge to underplaying", to be too much pressure on his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, the role they came to as on the podium, the profession was not always so tender.
However, the first lovers played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lumps and despair, whose fall and revolts were reflected in his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known pages of his shy sensibilities.
His 1968 film Rachel (according to the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), which starred his wife Joanne Woodward, features a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
His son Scott, whom he lost due to an overdose, in 1984 he dedicated the film Harry and Son, a work full of study and sorrow.
In the wake of the riots that happened to Newman yesterday, his great friend and ex-combatant Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and the Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) lamented: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Grace, love of life, these are the main characteristics of a dead actor.
Forgetting his legendary career, he’s also a big fighter for civil rights, ecology, independent film, and an opponent of Hollywood’s downfall.
We were used to seeing his likeness on bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, which might seem rather untasteful to us, although at first it was a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to his Foundation for Heavy Childhood account.
So, rather than let him boast, Newman engaged in the company until the last moment.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing these words: "Always and to the end your father was grateful for his happy planet.
I was honored to be here.”
And it was an honor for us to follow the path of life of such a bright and generous American artist.
And besides, at the end of the day, an exemplary citizen.
What was produced in the factory for invoices Zuschlag & spol.?
Soon, on 8 October, he will begin his portrayal in the criminal proceedings against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his associates.
In addition to other criminal offences, including forgery of documents, the politician and his associates are accused of fraud by a long-standing and systematic criminal organization, as a result of which they have caused extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecutor’s office, they used the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and often proved the fulfillment of tasks by fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and the authorities - including about 65 million forints - traveled in part to the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, in part to the pockets of individuals.
The way in which the investigating authority was also informed was that the money obtained in public tenders was selected on the basis of invoices for which there was no actual counter-value and the undertakings accepted by the association were never received.
According to the complaint, most of the invoices were fake.
The prints for these invoices came from the Yozsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros market, the round stamp was made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision was made about which companies are to produce invoices, among other things, on the county road along the northern coast of Balaton, to which Istv<0xC3><0xA1>na Ladose J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag sent.
According to his statement, he had to look at the guesthouses and restaurants first named.
In them he asked for accounts for his consumption, according to which the invoices submitted in public competitions were then produced, among other things, by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, and the Self-Government of the capital.
The invoices were mostly exhibited by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados with his partner Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>rim, who, according to our information, most often wrote the messages needed to obtain subsidies.
During his "study trip", Lados looked out at one of the cellars.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this catering facility provided for a 90-member group from the Biztos Pont association.
However, according to the head of the company, so many people wouldn’t come to this facility at once.
In the same way, the formal and content errors of the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 were hampered by a foundation named Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>rét, later Egy<0xC3><0xBC>ttt and Third <0xC3><0x89>vezredt.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomaji had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet one hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
However, the authors of the manuscripts with a rich imagination exceeded this even when they listed on the documents a company dedicated to the same hospitality - Pigal s.r.o., in whose accounting according to the information provided to the state representative, documents bearing the name of Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>pov<0xC3><0xB6>.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the head of the company for hvg.hu, said that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that they were fake documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were in the wrong place."
In addition to the formality, he added, he did not agree that 100 people were accommodated by the bill, because they only have eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, food was also included on the invoice, with their restaurant not working for a long time.
The hot manufacturers of invoices did not even convince themselves that the well-known Budapest travel office organizes only foreign trips, and on the invoice with payment in cash, which also did not coincide with the invoicing practice of the company, said the fool as a service of mediation of the money.
In addition, as was the case during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, although the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
The four documents issued by the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation by Hotel Révf<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xB6>p s.r.o. did not agree, among other things, on the amount of VAT. The company’s activities are not subject to the above 25 percent VAT, but to the 15 percent VAT, in addition, the employees of the hotel would be subject only to the fact that the employees of the
In addition, the “issuers” have broken the invoice by stating to one company how it came about through an investigation by the state representative, as an activity carried out by road transport of goods that the company that was originally based on investment advice did not perform.
The fact that invoices are issued by the Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt Foundation and the Third <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Foundation and the 21st Century Cultural Association and the Biztos Pont are false, has also been caused by formal deviations - the incorrect format of the invoice and the incorrect stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehert<0xC3><0xB3>, whose representatives denied that the invoices would be issued by them.
For example, the counterfeiters did not even notice that HIB s.r.o. from Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>zy was at the time (2001), when a group from the Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért association was eating in the liquidation, which is why, according to our information, the liquidation commissioner of the company would also deny that he had eaten.
The invoices were made aware.
The second group of invoicers consists of those who knew they were supposed to exhibit a fictitious invoice.
The Esely Budapestért Foundation has issued accounts for about four million HUF for the Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Foundation at the request of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Socialist.
According to the complaint, one of the defendants, Ludovic Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rfi, was responsible for the issuance of a fictitious account.
Zuschlage and his associates also cooperated with Biogate s.r.o., currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation and the Atlasz and V<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>sfeny<0xC5><0x91> companies with invoices worth about five million forints, which were not real or were not real.
Neither the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which, of course, the organizations forgot to mention in their documents.
Another group of invoicing companies includes those that had links to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the authorised representative of the Ukrainian agent of Delta Trio s.r.o., dealing with the trade in propellant and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not to be found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computing equipment in the value of approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment s.r.o., which was liquidated from 14 September 2005.
A member of this company was a man from Romania, to whom he was to hand over letters concerning the company also Ivan Kubatov in the years 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that on behalf of the company he issued invoices to the societies Atlas, Hopp and the Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt and <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Foundation and accepted their counter-value.
At the request of Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatova, the Romanian companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get the job.
However, the companies were in his favor, because at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their founding papers, he issued an invoice on behalf of the companies to the societies Atlas and Y-Generation connected to Zuschlag.
On behalf of companies Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave organizations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The state representative ruled that Kubatov came to 10 percent of the amounts listed on invoices and VAT.
For the exhibition of fictitious invoices, this time for the selection procedure for the company Biztos Pont, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k. t.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation and Association for Modern Hungary submitted proposals to the public competition of the Mih<0xC3><0xA1>lye T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsicse Foundation (TMA), a publicly beneficial organization of the Socialist Party.
They gained 500 thousand forints, but did not spend the amounts on the targets set out in the proposals.
To avoid this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s.r.o.
These invoices were found at a home inspection in the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the indictment, some of the defendants are likely to describe the process of producing invoices, as they have already done at the prosecutor’s office.
It may be more interesting if the main defendant, J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag, decides to reveal everything himself.
His statement so far is not too detailed, and although he has promised several times that he will expound everything widely, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, with which perhaps the socialists have made a deal and Zusi will take it upon himself.
He could have been insulted by the rest of the time, as his request to relieve the conditions of his detention, that is, of being placed in a domestic prison, remained unheard of.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes, who have inflicted much greater damage, who have not yet recovered, can freely walk, or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
Trumping Psychology: Why Do We Spend More Money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate the goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known—and seemingly irrational—behavior have been able to reveal to researchers in the field of neurology and economics at the University of New York.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people don’t want to lag behind in an eBay auction competition, so they’d rather pay too high a price.
Research using an experimental auction tried to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group took part in the auctions, and using the method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were examined the active areas of the brain of the subjects.
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but during the auction game, the important element of which is to overwhelm the other side, began to function intensively during the loss of a whole located under the cerebral cortex, called striatum.
In addition to many other functions, this area of the brain plays a role in the “self-replacement” mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, it is possible, according to the researchers, to explain the effort to avoid a sharp striatum reaction.
To support their theory, members of the research team from a number of economists conducted a financial cross-sectional survey.
Under different conditions, three groups were bidding against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made bets.
In addition, the members of the other group were promised that if they exit the game victoriously, they will receive an additional $15 for the reward.
The third group, on the other hand, received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also lost this money.
The difference between the two groups, therefore, consisted of everything in the fact that one was emphasized victory and the other was a loss.
However, the members of the group playing "against loss" were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
“These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
They have so far explained the phenomena observable in the auctions of the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped us resolve the discrepancy between these two theories so that we have now reached the third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated. The reason is that the patient often does not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the generic name for the infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, it is characteristic of inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the causes of the disease and the diseases caused by them differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways depending on the underlying disease: hepatitis A and E by digestive systems (e.g. food infected, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood and body fluids (sperm, sweat).
In any case, travellers should be protected against A and B virus vaccination, there is no type C virus vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after eating an infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, and the urge to vomit.
Then yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, a light stool and dark urine will be formed. The treatment can take two to three weeks.
Every year, millions of people worldwide die of a more serious type of the disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only one in ten people infected with the drug are treated.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, the cause of the disease destroys the liver cells in a way that causes the first symptoms in many cases up to 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent premature, to carry out regular screening.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more frequently than on average: among people who had undergone blood transfusions before 1991, among drug users and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated worldwide number of individuals infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease may prove to be a routine laboratory examination, a person should, in the event that he or she records any signs of unknown origin, contact his or her practical doctor.
With timely detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing infections and preventing the formation of cancer.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, which was organized for the first time worldwide by disease-representing organizations in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its occurrence and the importance of timely recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God, doesn’t it hurt so much?
According to the results of recent research, faith in God acts as a certain analgesic that could ease the death of already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, exploring how faith in the god affects the perception of pain in a person, reported the British Telegraph.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and an equal number of atheists succumbed to electric shocks, while all observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
Thanks to a technique that examined the human brain in detail, it was also shown that Catholics were able to activate that part of their brain, which is responsible for regulating pain.
The research is the first of a series of studies, which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university participate.
The test was carried out precisely by attaching a flashing instrument to the left hand of the test subject, which produced electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to observe two paintings: the 17th-century Lady of Sassoferrat and the 15th-century Lady of the Border by Leonardo da Vinci.
The authors of the research hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would evoke a certain state of piety among believers, while da Vinci chose the image because it did not differ too much from the first and seemed to them a calming impression.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner and during this time received in four successive parts 20 electroshocks, while separately watching the image with a religious or general theme.
The Catholics stated that when looking at the Virgin Mary, they felt “safe” as if they had been “taken care of” and “relaxed, peace filled them.”
As they watched the religious-themed image, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonard’s work before them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any highly impressive image even among atheists, it is only necessary to find the right photo.
"We should find a picture that they will perceive very positively, from the position of a mother or father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it will also change our personality,” Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on regulating the pain of believers if they showed them a Madonna from Leonard or a painter of a similar caliber.
Would a look at the quality of the Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You are what you share with yourself
On his 10th birthday, Google can say that people can find him in their pockets at least as well as in the sky above their heads; they know where they were on vacation, what they’re looking for, and what they’re interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s chief executives, however, that’s still not enough.
However, as far as skeptics are concerned, paralleling Orwell’s dark vision, the very essence of Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary in order for the founders of Google to be able to stick to their original intention, which sounded: "Inform the world!"
According to a Google spokesperson, the company is only at the beginning of ten years of global work so that it can work with all the information.
Asked what would happen in five years’ time, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like “what should I do tomorrow?” or “what job would be suitable for me?” – to ask such seemingly simple questions, but the software will not be able to answer.
Not all Internet users are well aware that the search terms are accurately captured during the internet search, and also what IP address was searched from and to which pages the searchers moved after.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, users can, for example, save their browsing history on the server, look back on what they were looking for and what they clicked on, thanks to which, in the long run, they generate the searches that will be customized to them, and they will be able to log directly on the server.
What if my data is being used against me, what if someone looks at me, what do I do? - ask users who are afraid when looking at the data monopoly of Google.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company is rather dangerous, the counter-reaction does not cause in Internet users guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all search terms are not only captured, but in justified cases can also be issued by a third party, in such legal cases the personal rights of internet users are not protected.
The most well-known example of this was a coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that enabled the identification of paedophiles from the Orkut community sites established through it.
Internet users who worry about their privacy rights, however, were able to take a breather in May, when the firm in hand with the EFF’s electronic rights protection organization successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google may not even in the future be a whistleblower to inform the constitution.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully battled almost fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it obtained with the appeal for reinforcements years ago of the Children’s Protection Act, however, it failed to get lists of searchable individual items.)
The view on Google is so disconcerting: it is bullied by those who fear the provision of their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be by starting to use Google’s services, exposed to harm, and coming up against it with a crackdown on the likes of the confederacy.
And so far, American geek culture and its wild link, amassing around it enthusiastic computer fans, activists, and users, emerging in many countries, see in it a new generation of bigotry, "the corporation that now frowns", as opposed to its rival Windows vying for Microsoft, the nature of the game.
This may be due to the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require identification code from its users and does not want money for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs acts as a much more accessible, younger, older-age software.
However, this can also be caused by the fact that geeks understand exactly the very problematic relationship between the internet and personality rights, which has brought with them just one of the most revered keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing more than a collaboration, that we deliberately leave traces behind and use the communication channels that we have available, and although their scope is different for everyone else, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can upload a profile to several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect with other services, for example with Twitter or the application last.fm, recording the music they listen to, the system can connect to the
At the same time, we can learn about a lot of exemplary cases, from which she wakes up: the girlfriend in the morning looking at the flood of photos of her mutual friends will easily come up with who her funny friend spent the evening with, or the company can throw away his employee only because he is angry at his blog
The person who lives an online life consists of what he or she shows, so we could define the basic thesis hiding behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something or at least avoid a Google monopoly has the option (it starts with Scroogle, which uses Google’s search engine, but does not intentionally leave any traces).
For example, a small number of people do not register on community sites to be able to find them. Online Google applications from text editor to photo editor and news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions, which are not connected to large server parks and which of us may not be able to
Public opinion is not too secretive when Google will show its teeth.
With its current value of $156 billion more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense ad space threatens Microsoft’s design agencies, and Microsoft’s services are constantly evolving.
Critical observers, however, also find counterpoints acting in a disturbing way: the top management, for example, rejected employee protests after it raised twice the fee for corporate schooling, the employee's usual daily allowance, the employee's allowance, the employee's allowance, the employee's allowance
One of the internal rules of the company is that it will never be able to advertise new services in advance, it will only be possible to use them, but it is certain that the expected problems of the following months and years can be prevented by the world in new places: while some think that the project of Golu
The fact that Google is compiling a genetic database, then it can serve as a good starting material for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the famous novel by Cory Doctor "Scroogled" describes with Orwellian reminiscences the future, in which one can use Gobish to terrorize people.
A double killer from <0xC3><0x93>zd helped to remove the footprints of two young people
Two youths have been heard by police in the case of a double murder in <0xC3><0x93>zd, allegedly helping to remove traces of this criminal act, said a spokesman for the Supreme Police Directorate of Mayor Borsod on Tuesday.
People have learned about the activities from which they were suspected and are currently accused of aiding the criminal offence.
Both youths, according to the MTI's information two girls, are being sued for freedom.
Aiding a criminal offence is punishable by deprivation of liberty for up to 5 years.
Suspected of a double murder in Ozda, the 23-year-old man here, was taken into temporary custody on Sunday.
He's a suspect in a pre-planned multiple murders for malicious reasons.
During the investigation, it was revealed that a 23-year-old young man owed a larger amount to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so he dragged his creditor to a factory in <0xC3><0x93>zd last Wednesday, where he killed a man first and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the youth was preparing in advance for the commission of a criminal offence, which is also evidence that he committed the murder with weapons hidden at the scene of the crime.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy Prague stock exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a hundred percent package of shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party, although the Czechs had previously ruled out the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of its securities in a few months.
According to the Czech economic journal E15, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered to those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to Czech newspapers, they have so far offered the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche B<0xC3><0xB6>rse.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange Petr Koblic said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and did not rule out that this could lead to the collapse of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold out.
The largest shareholder of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25% interest, followed by the Czech Savings Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the perspective of the European sheets
In their Tuesday comments on the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European lists already remind us of "the second of September 11".
We can thank the President of the United States for the global financial disaster, the Roman La Repubblica accuses. The President has not even been able to shake his own side in support of the hastily paid bill aimed at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which reminded billionaire investor Warren Buffett, we could talk about the second 9/11.
Also part of the Madrid press sees the culprit in Washington.
According to the newspaper El Mundo, the global economy has brought a lack of political leadership to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is constantly growing, and the whole world will eventually pay for it.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but after a vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool to solve the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air – just at the moment when one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism takes place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, according to the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
So far, individual states have been able to throw a bailout ring at corrupt monetary institutions, and taxpayers have been able to save them from collapse.
However, if more banks are toppled like bricks, then neither money nor other improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to transfer themselves through their national egoism and to consolidate control over fragmented financial markets.
Just on Monday, the laying monetary institutions received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion, according to the Vienna Der Standard, according to which there are concerns that, like the Americans, they will have to reach deep into the pockets of European taxpayers in order to solve the crisis.
The European Union is facing a crisis that, like a tsunami, has not been seriously affected by the old continent.
The bailiffs don’t have to have billions of euros at once, but it would be good if they firmly determined in which case it’s reasonable to go after taxpayers’ money to avoid even greater harm.
Intelligent car mimics the plane of a butterfly
What, then, would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not the imitation of obstacles detectors occurring in the world of nature?
Take bees, for example.
The initial strategic idea of a surprise project, presented at the Japanese CEATEC fair, was inspired by engineers from Nissan, and how to build a new generation of collision-preventing systems.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan has built a biomimetic robotic control system BR23C, a robotic mini-car that is equipped with bee features, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all crashes.
“During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety protective packaging,” explained Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of the Technology PR and Research and Development brand at the exhibition.
An important role is played by complex eyes, which allow bees to see in all directions at a visual angle of more than 300 degrees.
In order to copy the function of the compound eye, the engineers followed the idea of a laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles at a distance of up to 2 meters before the BR23C in the 180 degree field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns into an operation aimed at preventing a collision.
The obstacle is caught during a split second, then the robotized car begins to mimic the movements of the bees and by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent a collision immediately changes direction.
In contrast to any existing system, this evasive maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If that were not the case, the robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology suits the most vulnerable and inner layer of the security protection package, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what bees do to avoid other bees.
This process should not take longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or downwards, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be rotated.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees when avoiding, in the case of a robotic car, only the possibility of rotational movement, acceleration and slowing was applied.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion variants.
According to Andoa, it is important to have an instinctive, intelligent reaction, not the ability to process, but rather the storage of data.
This mechanism must process and respond only to a few incoming signals per second.
It is not necessary to store and react to them using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it constantly uses only memory the size of a few kilobytes.
It does not need memory with gigabyte or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step in the development of a technology that is used to avoid the immediate impact that Nissan is expected to have on mass-produced cars within ten years.
Another possibility of application may be the connection of the unit to the satellite navigation system GPS, which, after avoiding obstacles in the way, would lead the motorist to the specified final destination.
Damn dear baby already has a name
The $700 billion economy bailout bill, which is to be divided into several installments and whose purpose is to buy back poor bank loans, is already in writing.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further negotiations, which ended only Saturday after midnight of U.S. Eastern Time, representatives of Congress reached an agreement in a few days of debate on the $700 billion bailout package, Reuters reported.
"We've made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, who said there was only one deal left.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson on the outcome of the compromise said: “The program will work and be effective, but further steps need to be taken.”
The written form of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. Washington time (that is, Monday at 2 a.m. Central European time), but no special stock market rises were caused.
The proposal for a legal norm hearing on the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 to be established by the programme will be put to the vote of the House of Representatives on Monday, followed by a series in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, after which the White House welcomed reports of the deal.
"With the progress made last night, we are pleased and very appreciative of both sides' efforts to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program differs from the original Bush administration proposal, in which it was intended that a total of $700 billion be spent on the purchase of non-quality mortgage-backed securities at once.
Now it is possible to spend a maximum of half of $700 billion in the first half, so that 250 billion will be spent immediately after the things are expected to be decided by Congress on Monday, and the Treasury will buy for them securities secured by mortgages valued at $100, which will be assessed as non-assessed.
The program will be controlled by a special committee, which will also be a member of the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Spending the second half of $700 billion will depend on the next congressional decision.
The Ministry of Finance can, in the sense of the law, apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy non-quality loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, or other "one-of-a-kind" loans.
The purchase can take place as part of the auction and directly, the competent representatives of the ministry said.
The legal norm will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee on funds that are a cause for concern, and the company will then pay a price corresponding to the amount of the damage expected.
According to Henry Paulson, the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent requirements of the U.S. financial system of up to $700 billion, whether it involves the large purchase of bad assets, their insurance, or the prevention of systemic fraud.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
The chief banks, who have gotten into trouble and are waiting for the state’s help, on the contrary, can count on the government to reduce their deviations – which in the offshore slang is simply called the “golden fall”.
In certain cases, their payment will only be limited, in addition, these restrictions will depend on the way in which the assistance provided by the Ministry is provided.
The restriction basically means that if the ministry is to buy in the auction, a tax cut will be imposed on gold falls if the bank directors are not sent straight to retirement.
In the case of a direct repurchase of non-quality loans, the government will aggressively step forward in the interest of ensuring that the money for management is not overstated.
It must be added that the existing gold fall contracts will not change, the restrictions only apply to new contracts, which is to be another incentive to participate in the programme.
"This is the first case in U.S. history where there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of directors-general," said Barney Frank, chairman of the House of Representatives' Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the State in the banks participating in the programme will have the right to acquire a share, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, because once the economy and the saved bank stand on their feet, they can also make a profit on this transaction.
The draft plan includes that in the next five years, the president must submit to Congress a proposal determining how taxpayers can recover the expected losses from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were also voices expressing themselves in relation to the plan of doubt.
“The American people didn’t ask us to do this, because it won’t protect taxpayers’ dollars,” said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio Mary Kaptur argues that the adoption of the provisions was urged by exactly those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise.
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, compared to August 2007 by 12.9 percent, the Central Statistical Office reported.
The export sales prices in the industry were higher by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent per annum.
Production prices in the industry were 0.7 percent higher as the cause of changes in domestic and export prices compared to the previous month, up 3.2 percent year-on-year.
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by only a minimum of 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month.
Also, domestic sales prices in the sectors of the processing industry increased slightly compared to July, by 0.1 per cent.
The biggest increase in prices occurred in August 2008 in the leather goods and footwear industry (2.8 per cent), mainly due to the monthly increase in prices in the bakery and saddle products industry by 4.6 per cent and the production of shoes by 2.5 per cent, respectively.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials has led to a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical and product production sector (1.6 per cent).
The prices were reduced in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), the production of electric machines and appliances (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum - in the woodworking sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices in the field of paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the processing industry, we have measured price increases in the range of 0.2 - 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sector, which has a high weight in the domestic waste industry, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the continuing influence of the officially established increase in gas prices from 1 July.
In the twelve-month comparison of domestic waste in the individual sectors of the processing industry, prices increased the most in the professional sector of oil processing (32.4 per cent).
In the metalworking industry it was possible to observe 13.2 per cent, in the field of food, beverages and tobacco products, which has a decisive weight, then an 11 per cent increase in prices.
In the textiles and textiles (2.5 per cent) and electrical machinery and equipment (0.3 per cent) sectors, prices have been reduced.
In other sectors of the processing industry, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the processing industry increased by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sector exceeded prices from the previous year by 18.7 percent.
In terms of division by sector, the highest monthly increase in prices (0.7 percent) in the sectors dealing with the production of tangible assets appeared in August in domestic sales.
In the sectors producing consumer goods, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, in the energy processing and further processing sectors, prices did not change compared to the previous month.
The largest increase in prices compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in August 2008 in the energy processing and further processing sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, we aimed to increase prices by 6.8 per cent, while in the case of tangible assets, prices fell by 1.4 per cent.
The export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, down by 3.9 per cent in the twelve-month comparison.
Over the course of one month, our domestic payment weakened by 1.7 per cent due to the euro, then by 7.1 per cent compared to August 2007 and by 7.5 per cent compared to the euro and by 15.9 per cent.
Next year in the U.S. without a visa?
According to Kingy G<0xC3><0xB6>nczov<0xC3><0xA1>, there is great hope that the U.S.-Hungarian visa-free agreement will come into force around January 12, the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago before the local community’s top officials.
According to her, "now almost everything depends only on whether an electronic system of road clearance, or controls, is being built behind the sea in time."
At the same time, she pointed out that part of the new system will not be allowed to enter, but tourists will have to be registered before departure.
The representative of the Hungarian diplomacy from today continues in the negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezzo Rice, who will hand over the Central Cross to the Star of the Order for the merits of the Republic of Hungary, and will hold talks with foreign policy advisors to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCrae.
Barack Obama and McCain are on a bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major U.S. parties, agreed on Sunday to secure their support for a $700 billion government bailout package for banks, but there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
After a several-day marathon of meetings with Congress and administration officials, it was announced early on Sunday morning: a basic package deal was concluded to save the banks.
The financial package, which aims to reinvigorate the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain have consistently called themselves the most suitable of the two candidates that would lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, at the same time as they got ahead of the economic question, Obama once again gained a certain edge, and McCain’s jump broke out, which he secured after the Republican Convention nominations of Sarah Palin as vice president.
Obama said at a pre-election meeting in Detroit on Sunday that he hoped the 700-billion-dollar package bill would be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages relating to consumer protection, which he also supports.
“We need to act now, responsibly ... on your places, on savings, on the entire industrial sector, on the stability of the entire economy is in danger,” he told a crowd of 35,000.
He didn’t miss the opportunity to call McCain’s ideas about the economy obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “It’s all going to be a bit of a hassle ... but doing nothing is just not a possible way.”
As stated by the Republican Senator, the draft includes the establishment of a committee overseeing the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the derogation for senior representatives to whom he insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a more significant role in the negotiations, but he was himself in daily contact with the minister.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Overview of the printing of the German language region
The legal camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more self-aware - so analyzes the weak result of CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria in order to prevent the red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU in his article entitled “The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Fathers”.
According to a well-known political scientist, CSU began erosion long before its office took over the sad duo Beckstein-Huber.
Christian socialists have been restoring Bavaria for decades – and now these modern citizens are turning away from it.
At the same time, changing the period is a problem for the whole Christian democracy, and thus also for Angela Merkel.
Debakl was not entirely surprising for CSU, but on Saturday ended a process that could have been predicted for almost exactly ten years: ended the indisputable hegemony of one state party.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, below the 50 percent limit.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, in the so often-remembered Stoiber period.
The reason is the modernization that CSU has consistently carried out in this country and that is being eaten by its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the same time they were very wrong. The secularization, the results of education, the settlement of Germans from the east and from the north in the developing regions of Bavaria could not, however, be without consequences for the loyalty of the voters of the CSU.
Modernisation is associated with the growth of opportunities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within it have become more self-aware, critical, and self-righteous.
It is also clear that in recent weeks CSU has moved away the most from the classical civic strata; people in the free profession, nutritionists, individuals with maturities and higher education.
The CSU support has already fallen below 40 per cent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese Diary, in its article entitled "Who, with whom? The Presiding Parties Are Detainable in Coalition Matters", deals with the confused internal political situation created as a result of the Austrian elections.
SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to deal with <0xC3><0x96>VP.
<0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the involvement of SP<0xC3><0x96> in its internal affairs.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> appears to be open to all negotiations, the Greens do not yet want to negotiate a coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the presidents of the parties did not have much time to look at their cards.
SP<0xC3><0x96> President Werner Faymann has confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
And the SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - in some federal countries and in social partnership.
The question of whether Faymann will be able to imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Malterer, the current chairman of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice-chancellor, has remained open.
As he put it, the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>ssel-Molterer course was voted on every fall.
The repetition of this direction is not taken into account.
Molterer responded to the red offers carefully.
As he said, the cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still completely open on the side, these issues need to be discussed decisively within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> President J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider once again appeared open in all directions.
“In order to prevent a black-and-red coalition, we are prepared to take on government responsibilities,” Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1>: It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
In Paris today, the European Summit for Equality, which this year hosts France, the current President of the European Union, began.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, Member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz Movement, as one of the main speakers of the professional yearbook in her message addressed to the plenary, drew attention to the segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children, and, above all, to their overbearing children.
The summit was launched by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir <0xC5><0xA0>pidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, on behalf of the French Presidency.
They sat for the year among the invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil society associations working in the field of equal opportunities.
According to Fidesz J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, the press office of the group of MEPs in the movement, she pointed out that in addition to the discrimination that occurs in recruitment of labour, Roma are being pushed out of the European labour market primarily because of their low education.
“The vast majority of young Roma do not have a high school education, and as a result of poor quality basic education, only a small part of them can achieve a higher level of education.”
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1> also stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investing in early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to establish awareness of these connections in the broadest circles - between Roma and non-Roman children.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the greater the chance of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and consumer taxes they contribute to the national budget.
"Rome is the right of their citizenship of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their excessive quality and separate education," L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
According to the honourable Member, the coherence of the European Union with the focus on the objectives and the negotiations is necessary in order to speed up the process of school dissegregation and, above all, to this end, it is important to properly comply with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to give Roma children the opportunity given by the democratic space, so that they, as full citizens, can participate in the future of Europe," J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1> demanded.
The aim of the European Summit on Equality, held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, is guaranteed to everyone in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", to provide a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of inequalities between Europeans and non-Europeans.
CSU: Temporary Grace
The fate of the listening duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the embarrassing electoral debacle, the debate on personal issues has so far been postponed by the tops of the Bavarian CSU.
The party president Erwin Huber and the country’s prime minister G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Beckstein may still be in their seats, the question is as long as this grace lasts.
The fate of Tandem, who suffered a disastrous 17% loss of votes, will be decided by the party’s extraordinary congress last October.
In any case, the members of the highly criticized duo were told that they would not be able to stand on their posts.
They tried to calm down the angry members of the faction and the bases, who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the "Bavorian tsunami" to produce personal consequences.
Five years ago - the truth, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career - gained 60.7 percent of the Christian-Social Union, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but only 43.4 percent of its strength.
In Bavaria, CSU produced 18 percent of Germany’s GDP as a “self-governing” for 46 years.
Still, the conservatives in the southern federal state, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, have a high position, but in the future they will be forced to form a coalition anyway.
One of the first signs of a reorganisation within the party is the fact that a member of a narrow intelligence team, who will initiate probe negotiations on the possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, or with the right-wing group of Free Voters, will be the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister.
It is ironic that Gabriele Pauli, whose speech against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out the coup, entered the House on the Free Voter candidate, but then with an ambitious communal politician they made a very short process.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transitional period, the active role will also be played by Stoiber, who has so far managed the strings from the background, the former prime minister and former CSU president called September 28 the most patient day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made several driving remarks to the CDU, according to him, they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become a chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in national success in 2005, is somehow put on its feet by the common forces.
According to Merkel, who was struggling to hide her disappointment over the failure, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which is, of course, relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier and the crisis of social democrats continues.
The SPD achieved in Bavaria with 18.6 percent of the worst result since 1946.
Lukashenko:positions - 110:0
In Sunday’s elections, not a single opposition MP has been elected to the Belarusian parliament.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the prosperity and stability prevailing in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE), by the illegalities that occurred in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-member legislature of 10 million countries has been missing the opposition for well ten years, the opposition united under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's elections seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who left the parliament in opposition to changes in the constitution in the 2006 elections, would be elected in the next elections.
The ODS has also abandoned the previously considered boycott.
In the background of the opposition's expectations, the anti-Russian economy was becoming increasingly dependent on Russia, and the European economy was becoming increasingly dependent on Belarus - which, in order to mitigate the impact of the constantly irritating Russian natural gas imports, took credit and contributed to the fact that Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipeline, was moving from Russia to Russia.
The release earlier indicated that when evaluating the pre-election campaign, the OSCE emphasized positive shifts rather than shortcomings - for example, the ban on the candidacy for a third of opposition candidates.
The OSCE’s Monday flash report, however, already had reservations about a campaign during which opposition candidates could not in fact appear in the press, especially since the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
At the same time, according to the opposition, there can be only improvement in the political system: political prisoners were released for freedom and Minsk is willing to let go with Moscow even in smaller confrontations, if it continues to refuse to recognize the deposed Georgian state of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevic told our letter.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that it remain so, even though "it was too late to let a single member of the opposition in the insignificant parliament".
Looking at the results of the opposition, he does not plan protest actions, rather he tries to deliver his message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"With this, of course, we have a lot of problems, we have to print opposition letters in Russia, the distribution is putting obstacles to the local authorities, yet I see that the change is supported by more and more people, even among the older ones," Milinkevic said, pointing out that Lukashenko's
"Due to the country's debt and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security 'instigating the silence of the cemetery' collapses," Milinkevic said.
In contrast to opposition politics, the Russian observers of the election rated the election as democratic.
The head of the Commonwealth of Independent States' mission, Sergei Lebedev, told Russian news agency Ria Novosti that "people do not believe in words but acts", so the absence of opposition is nothing more than evidence of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
This is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that a revolving door has been installed at the arrival and departure of employees.
But from now on, this new measure will work against people who are bloated, against those who sneeze and then go to coffee during working hours.
The anti-launch news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renata Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Maurem Masi.
“The revolving doors,” says Brunetta, “are a tool for better work, higher performance, more attendance and more services.”
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency is opening up.
It’s about reformism,” Brunetta said.
At Chigi Palace, we will complete the implementation of the Presidency of the Council in all buildings.
For Masi, “the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view.”
There were no objections on the part of the employees, the secretary-general assures: "It was a joint procedure with the employees and cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunette smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a regular cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning."
During a conference at the Higher Vocational School for Public Administration
In Rome, the minister will finally announce that in three months the absence of public employees for the disease has decreased by 50%, that is, by 60,000 more people per year at work.
And he adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
“In the last 8-10 years, its pay-out dynamics has doubled with respect to the private sector and is far higher than the inflation rate.”
In the meantime, thousands of public employees have come together to reject the norms of the Brunett Decree in accordance with a request supported by Codacons.
“While the Minister of Public Administration will present today figures relating to a lower absence from work due to the disease,” writes the Consumer Protection Association, “the nation of ‘poor lazy people’ is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct employees in public administration who have come together to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.”
In particular, Taru will protest against the exclusion of sickness allowance, which depends on the activities; the extension of the time during which it is possible for the patient to check the time-limit for control visits, and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Occupational injuries, Napolitano: "Resolution prevention"
Every day in Italy there will be 2,500 work injuries, three people will die, and twenty-seven will remain permanently disabled.
Inail’s figures confirm that in 2007 there were around 1,200 deaths from work-related injuries.
These values testify to the seriousness of the offense, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double the number of deaths compared to homicides.
To rekindle the attention of institutions, social and information media on this dramatic problem, Anmil today celebrates the 58th National Day of Victims of Work Injury in all regions of Italy, set for the second Sunday in October.
"The worrying data extended by Anmil and the same tragic reports these days confirm how important the issue of safety at work is," said President Giorgio Napolitano in a message sent to President Anmil, National Association for Frozen, Pfizer and Invalids.
The head of state expresses his living admiration for the continued joint efforts to ensure safety in the workplace, to protect injured workers, to help families of victims and to share public opinion.
"Naturally, a revolted 'enough' has been raised, frankly shared in the face of tragedies, which, by their extent, cause unrest in the media and the participation of public opinion, but the everyday reality again offers us dramatic cases, even in a dynamism of the opposite."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
It is of particular importance that numerous initiatives in the field of education are developed so that young people facing the world of work can gain a clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its worrying social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative norms.
President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini, for his part, stressed that "as it turns out that death from a work-related accident creates an absolutely critical social condition, as it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort to do what is necessary."
“As far as the data of work injuries appear to show a certain positive turn, but it does not deny that the number of deaths as a result of work injuries is both alarming,” President Anmil Pietro Mercandelli said.
“We don’t want this ‘dream of reduction’ to lead to less attention, because it is at the moment when the attention stops that tragedy erupts.
"We believe that in general there is still very little work being done to stop the problem of injuries and there are many activities that can have an impact on this problem.
In our view, it is necessary to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the area of training of workers, right from the school age.”
"There is still a need for further efforts in terms of communication and co-option of public opinion.
But above all, there is a need for greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon.
Mercandelli finally said that it was a progressive degeneration of the level of entitlement to compensation expected for the victims of work and "removal of supportive care" to which the system has been getting in recent years."
“The aim is therefore to return to the worker the guarantee of insurance, because the fate of those who injure themselves must not depend on the spontaneity or the gift of time by the legislator.”
Mp3 Players Accused, Exposed to Risk
Listening to music for longer periods of time and using portable musical instruments as an Mp3 player can cause lasting hearing loss.
According to today's announcement by the European Commission, which in an official report circulated in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Committee on Health Risks, which has recently emerged and been identified (Csrseri) by the EU.
“From this scientific point of view – we read in the notes – it turns out that 5-10% of those who listen to music for at least five years using portable musical instruments, for more than an hour a day, and keep the instrument at high volume, are at risk of permanent wear and tear.
“I’m concerned that so many young people who often use portable musical instruments and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unknowingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” Kuneva admits.
“From the scientific findings,” the leader continues, “there is a clear risk and a rapid response needs to be made.
The most important thing is that we have to encourage consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding, so that they become fully effective and keep up with the new technology.”
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem in view of the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Scientists - the EU's executive official concluded - confirm that there is a need to take care of themselves and now the European Commission will check together with the other members and parties that raised the problem, what measures could possibly be taken to protect children and young people from bullying, bullying and bullying.
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but concerns are growing about hearing loss, which can be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee states that users of portable musical instruments, if they use a volume of music (more than 89 decibels) for a period of only five hours per week, will exceed the currently valid limits corresponding to the maximum permissible threshold.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for a longer period of time risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and their amount can be calculated between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno leave free passage to the Commission for the future of the capital
We will start today, we will close in March, we will have sums in June.
Such is the calendar given by Campidoglie to the workers "Committee for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning in its new headquarters behind the Caracalla Spas.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the commission will draw up manuals for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglia and his councilor Gianni Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas - it wants to emphasize Alemanno - it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by the political decision-makers who remain the Giunta e Municipal Council.
It’s not about any change of function, but just about trying to have some place to process a big project for Rome.
In March, the work will be completed and then dissolved, because these institutions must have an exact deadline.
In June, the mayor announces, we will present a strategic plan and use the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome’s capital.”
To the one who accuses the Commission of negligence in view of the fact that its opinion will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are high-quality, as are the Attali Commission proposals, and I am sure of that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics will pay off on day-to-day problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to emphasize that "this Commission is neither an unnecessary undertaking nor a bluff: it is completely free, the Roman citizens will not cost either the euro and serve to rethink and involve the best intelligence that the capital has".
For Alemann, in essence, “it is necessary to have a strategic plan as a starting point, neither definitive nor immutable, in order to allow our city to rise to the level it needs, and to think in a united spirit about its future.”
The future, which, the mayor of Rome specifies, "will not be limited only to the current municipal borders, but will look much further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as the capital, but "also includes the role that Rome can and must play".
Obama? First anti-American president. Already know why
A well-known U.S. president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.”
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and maintained relations (as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on the website: “This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the courage: he thinks he will get to the highest post of the nation, which had two governors and five black senators in all!”
In fact, these attacks don’t say much”; they are attacks of clearly racial origin and don’t answer voters’ question: will he be a good president? And then we have surveys; they all say Obama will win and with a big jump.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
One newspaper in Mississippi, from the ruins of the southern United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the polling booth we know well who the American patriot will give his voice to.
There will be one page of the American mentality that has remained on top of it until the last moment.
“Tell me what you want, and we’ll take care of it ourselves, who we’re going to nail, if Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear that if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain success of a black candidate.
However, despite all these considerations for Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
1,500 people were asked: what mistakes did Bush make during his term of office? Eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home with a spear in its ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq has become, for the most part, Bush's weakness.
Whoever takes the place of Georgie W will have to perform a huge task.
The economic collapse of the United States has also been felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
The PEW Research Center questioned five hundred journalists on the status of their profession and the assumption as to the future.
Well, today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the questions did not say openly that they had less concerns about reliability.
He doesn't feel isolated like he used to.
The problem is money, the money, for American journalists.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put together the newspapers, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists interviewed, this is a problem that needs to be solved, if we do not want traditional journalism, as the general public understands it, to fundamentally change.
The American journalist is exposed to a clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press journalists and senior executives are convinced that journalism on a national scale is going the wrong way.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the website is going.
Larger publishers are paving the way for the Internet, which many see as a “killer” of the press.
"Economic pressure", which journalists are warning of, has increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred journalists admitted that they are turning to technology in the hope that they are “doing something good” for their journalist.
The biggest downfall in American journalism is between those who run newsrooms — that is, the leaders — and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level, the value drops to 23%.
This has something to do with the "safety of work".
Leaders who think they will lose their jobs within three years are at the national level 47%.
As far as journalists are concerned, they are moving to 30%.
When it comes to "certain work" concerning staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on the contract.
In a nation as huge as the US, with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and so it’s a matter of taking or leaving.
Managers are almost always paid huge salaries, and the editor can earn tens of thousands of dollars a month out of pension payments and insurance.
When it comes to vacations, the argument becomes complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year, to reach fifteen days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, according to their own confession, will often get sick within a year.
It is just a question of climate.
UNIPOL: SOUD IN ROMANS, DANILO COPPOLA STILL IN GROTTAFERRAT<0xC4><0x8C>
The president of the Second Criminal Court Chamber, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to refuse to submit the businessman with the realities of Daniel Coppola, who asked him to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with a counter-offer on the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense, he was released from house arrest last week, which was converted into a forced permanent stay in Grottaferrat.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the entrepreneur with the realities be able to change his place of residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against which PM expressed himself) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
A few days ago, the House of Representatives voted against a $700 billion bailout plan submitted to the White House: a significant portion of Americans were more interested in and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is plunging the Republican party, increasingly divided between its old soul of the East Coast, more moderate, sympathetic to the federal institutions and the business community, and that its new soul, which, on the contrary, is in a state of flux, is in a state of flux.
A soul that was arrogantly expressed by the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, this just quoted thing is just an example of the big changes that the current economic earthquake already shows: not only in the United States, but in the entire West, and perhaps not only here.
Both in the US and in Europe, this crisis seems to act as an accelerator of phenomena that have been incubated for a long time, which are being absorbed into the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-evaluation, the extraordinary revival of the market, the dual categories of State power in relation to a certain re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but which are mainly involved in the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
Which at the same time created a political problem for those who run it: it means how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears to be economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be substantially out of the game or that it has little to add: obvious evidence has been given by the European Union, which, as always, is divided between different interests and different state strategies and which cannot decide for a single common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, the rescue plans, the revival of the market, the new rules and, above all, the distribution of funds: at the moment when we are in a state of emergency, only the states have the economic means, the amount of financial resources to be put into place, so that the resources can be put into place.
And it also owns the necessary resources and permissions to use them: two sources of immense value, under certain circumstances, which perhaps no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose of to a similar extent.
This new emphasis, which the crisis places on the state-national element, is, after all, in absolute harmony with the ever-increasing importance which attempts to attribute the latest economic progress to a single factor closely linked to it: territorial competence.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of Sita, increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance had already been destined to rule the world, we would have realized from nothing that our
All things that would have been said can be carried from one place on earth to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to the limited space, the territory.
So who will become their ruler has certainly much more cards in his hand than who is not there and who has the misfortune of living in a place without grain, oil, and water.
I'm getting to the second novel, which, however, predicts a breakdown.
Whoever speaks of territory, of the state, of the government, inevitably speaks of politics, that is, of leadership.
Given the economic crisis, it seems that two convergent phenomena are being created.
On the one hand, he realizes that there is an objective need for authoritative leadership, a request for someone who can grasp the situation.
On the other hand, there is a wave of discrediting the existing leadership, especially the economic one, which has proved to be equally unsuited and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and, in a sense, disturbing: discredited, impatience, a sense of incompetence and absenteeism, which seeks to control the whole ruling class in more and more Western countries.
For it seems that it is becoming more and more widespread in the broad masses of the population of convictions than so that their actions are the same as those of the popular elites, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already surpassed their time and their indifference to ours.
The demand for leadership is short-lived from the ground of a single branch, but also a strong movement to eliminate the ruling classes and traditional political order is manifested in the recent electoral "refugees" or in the unexpected changes of the collectives.
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have ever greater problems to understand, that is to represent, which, not from today, is being created in the deep layers of the Western economies, is being torn apart by the rifts of the Western economies and that
Before that, it would be overwhelming to talk about a permanent "mass uprising".
But we certainly can’t say that it means having a properly open eyes.
Super glue for walking on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk the walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various U.S. research centers and now a team of four institutes is very close to it.
The scientists managed to keep a one-hundred-kilogram body glued to the vertical wall using a label of only 2.5 cm square.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Daytona, in Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is the development of materials already existing that use a special carbon structure, called carbon dwarf tubes.
“The base of the adhesive can be imagined as a series of tubes placed as an organized pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of the gecko, covered with microscopic furs, which allow the animal to provide a perfect fit.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the feet of these plazas and at the same time "just stick away from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton.
“This material could be useful as a temporary glue,” adds Liming Dai.
Is it possible to walk through walls like Spiderman? Perhaps so, but researchers are thinking of a far less fascinating use as a connection of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon pipes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering . . . . .
So far, no superheroes.
OVERVIEW – The University of Berkley, California, is also engaged in the research of a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists presented a glue formed from microfibers like hair that themselves cleans from dust by moving to the surface to still maintain perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never with juices
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving drugs, their enjoyment changes to enhance or reduce their effectiveness with serious health consequences.
For David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, to highlight the risk of sneezing the juices of both finished and fresh patients in combination with the consumption of some drugs, at the current 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, squeezing their squeaks and squeezing them with a new chill.
Flu juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing the effects of some antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs to a toxic level.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM – The Italian Medical Agency itself announced this in an information bulletin two years ago and urged doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger posed by this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink in case they take drugs such as melatonin.
NEN GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that dilute drugs.
A long list of the effects of grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the State University of Milan, said: “Such discoveries are usually immediately announced to the most diverse international and national drug agencies, which may arrange and exchange informational instructions.
So always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines you get and if you encounter something unclear, don’t worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification,” Ansa said in a statement.
Nobel Prize in Economics by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novoke<0xC5><0x88>an who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration’s foreign, economic, and political moves.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron crashed, Krugman predicted in a commentary published in the New York Times that the second event would be, in terms of consequences on U.S. history, far more important than the first.
The prediction, which caused a lot of controversy and was calculated over the years, but which proved to be accurate.
"I'm surprised and shocked at the speed at which the collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from the public interest," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is "an economy of great importance", but also a popularizer who has "a very aggressive style, especially critical of the excesses of Bush's liberal administration".
Open Office, we have here the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
Open Office.org 3.0 is an open source personal production package that aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more well-known Microsoft Office.
After about a year's work of volunteers controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office appears to the general public with various news: to the welcome screen and to the revised and improved opening window, additional, far more substantial, such as compatibility with the operating system for Mac OS X.
Emphasis is also placed on working with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open the document with a new Microsoft file extension (.docx,.xlsx,.pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of a PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for transferring electronically, or the ability to transfer a PDF file to a graphic design model and maintain the original appearance of the page.
Still from this point of view, we can create "PDF hybrid" documents that look like typical Adobe graphics and have the properties of a table processor or text program.
Collaboration is an element that has gained many improvements within application programs: in excel, it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts of change, in the text program, one color is assigned to each collaborator to the comments in the reviewer, so that each contributor is assigned one color to the comments in the reviewer.
Some companies are also working on transferring some of the Open Office features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should stop the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, has been added to the English version, which has been in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also the installation cd can be sent home or to the workplace on request.
And if the topic of free will can be a drag on the expansion in the home, it is in the Open Office business area that the package invests a lot, and it can already count on a variety of projects implemented in public administration and in schools.
And there is also a lack of training, consulting and assistance services that are ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a table processor that is aimed at replacing Excel; Impress for presentations similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases, Draw is a model;
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5ti million downloads, and when we consider that to date we are almost 3 million and 600,000, with the release of a new version it is possible that this predicted number can also be surpassed.
Also the results of Kohla are positive, it is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: this is Rakusan Bernhard Kohla, from Gerolsteiner, third-classified and winner of the best jumper t-shirt.
The report was cited by L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer positive for Ceru, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonard Piepoli and the Germans Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohla's blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control analysis confirms the positivity at Ceru, Raku<0xC5><0xA1>an will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the set two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohl’s positivity at the third-generation EPO is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced to the Associated Press that he had already informed the result of the Austrian government authorities.
26-year-old Raku<0xC5><0xA1>an was placed on the podium behind Spain’s Carlos S<0xC3><0xA1>stre and American Cadel Evans, he also won a punctuated top-scorer shirt.
IMMIGRANTI: NEW YORK TIMES IS ITALY RASISTO?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has only become the preferred destination of immigrants" accepted with resistance in the last house.
It turns a beautiful country into a nation of racists? That’s how one long article in the New York Times that devoted this article to a debate on racism in Italy, and started with the case of young Abdul William Guibre of Burkina Faso, who was murdered last month in Milan, was stolen because
This case illustrates what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are at the same time those that register "more integration and more work", but also "the strongest anti-immigrant thinking in the country and the strongest support of the Northern League".
To confirm the growing tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
Also, the new legislation demanded by Lego, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of a changing climate in Italy.
A tendency emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: “Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedict XVI in Quirinale, asked that the state and the church work together to defeat racism.”
Students with victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunia, specialists for tenants, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
“It appears that he has already reached such a level that the entire student population has lost their right to study because of the generally too high prices that their families would have to bear,” explains Laura Mariani, the head of the Sunia studio, who is demanding a lot of money from students in this city.
In most cases, the rental offer contains several violations: contracts in a free way, unregistered, without a limited lease, with related leases.
For Sunji, there is a need for exceptional action that could regulate prices thanks to the tax review.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, it takes about 450 euros for one bed, for a single room is paid from a minimum price of 650 (the Bande Nere zone) over an average value of 800 (the Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room costs about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the university, 250/280 euros per bed in a double room is needed, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double room.
Values are slightly lower (550 euros per single bed) in areas near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 euros per single room in the zones Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples, 300/450 euros is needed per bed, 400 to 600 euros per room, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 euros for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities such as Perugia, where it is the most common phenomenon for students from countries outside the European Union, there is finally another anomaly: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want for foreign students, compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities are ruining the historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinema is like a blind man, like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in large Italian city centers, but also in rural towns.
The process of restricting cinemas, the birth of large multi-seaters in the suburbs and the subsequent disappearance of mono-seaters in the central zones of cities is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of a real cultural crime.
“It’s like we lost a friend, a friend with whom we’ve shared a lot of paths and a lot of emotions,” says the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that won a movie from the Oscars, a movie that was released 20 years ago, a movie that starred in the Cannac<0xC3><0xAD>n film, and a great deal of emotion.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years closed the doors of 316 cinemas of the traditional type, and the highest account paid mainly the halls in the most important cities: about 5 in Florence, about 10 in Naples, and 9 in Milan.
Among the regions most affected is Emilia-Romagna with the loss of 82 cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the arrival of the multiplex, is these three Italian regions, which recorded the highest number of new cinemas: by 195 pay more in Lombardy in the last five years, by 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian procedure has evolved irrationally,” says Paolo Protti, president of Anec,” it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that those already existing will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all of its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Let us not even talk about insufficient funding for the fund for the benefit of operators: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is shameful that the government does not respect existing laws.
It would require between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 million and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million a year to support the sector.”
An interesting case is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to worry about closures and which decided to find the starting point with the signing of the protocol between the municipalities and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in the historical centers and in the suburbs.
Among the planned standards are tax relief measures in favor of operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to year to the zone with limited transportation and will have special prices to stop and in some parking lots.
“I like this initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna’s example by introducing other measures.”
However, it is certain that in order to be able to stand against the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today’s audience is more demanding.
Defending traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: the closure of Super cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was a spark that convinced me to establish a "New Cinema Paradiso", which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I’ve been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the already closed Rialt or Quirinal on Nazionale Street, where I’ve shared so much emotion that I don’t have to look at the inscriptions with black dust, I turn the other way.”
The connection between politics and the dranghet mafia group, Mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the election to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group."
The charges brought by the Directorate against the Mafia in Calabria against the mayor and vice-president Gioie Tauro against Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosario by Carl Martellim, who was arrested this morning for cooperating externally with the mafia, are organized.
Gioacchino Piromalli, an old middleman between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson a lawyer, the name of the boss, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia character, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
“They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense,” state officials wrote, when two local administrations expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with lawyer Piromallim.
“Thus, the mafia group would be able to officially enter the city authorities and thus facilitate the enormous possibilities of controlling and managing public administration.”
The president of the Calabrian Regional Commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and organized criminal underworlds are many in his region: "There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have a lot of local politicians who resist the pressures of ‘dranghets, heroes who are still uncorrupted.’
This morning’s arrests follow the July arrests, which showed police that the Piromalli mafia group had received a final strike.
Since the end of April last year – the city council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason why even at that time the link between organized crime and local government was assumed – local politicians were deprived of their functions in public administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, president of Christian Democrats, who was elected the head of the right-wing coalition after a narrow election in May at the time of the dissolution.
He was screaming over the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called for the responsibility of then Deputy Interior Minister Marc Minniti and accused him of plotting everything for political reasons, but the judges in the prison order signed this morning explain that the mob group had even reached so far that it had asked for a change.
Other hearings ordered against Dal Torrion, writes the public prosecutor, revealed "the desire to move the claims of the entrepreneur, the representatives of a larger group very close, as is generally known, to Piromallim and to adapt the choices of the public administration."
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones enter the game.
It is an infinite bearing that covers more than 70% of the earth’s surface and is now beginning to be discovered by large global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, and tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy, upon which the eyes of colossal entities such as Chevron, who are now trying to raise their hands on these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for more than a hundred years and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
As the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went sideways. But now ecological organizations and a new increase in the price of oil gave the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that approximately 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea waves.
that amount would be twice as much energy as is currently produced in nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are currents and tides and tides.
Giants are attacking.
The company that invested in marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it seemed to be a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of investing in marine energy, more and more companies are investing in marine energy rather than traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technology,” a spokesman for a company that is linked to the U.S. oil industry in the Wall Street Journal’s economic daily newspaper said in a statement, “and they’re thinking about the possibility of working with us.”
The cooperation we are considering is about obtaining permission from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of a project on the use of marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially when we consider that in Alaska, the United States is still extracting oil, and recently President Bush has come up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevrolet, both Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and the amounts invested so far, although not known in detail, show growing interest, according to observers.
Technology, kero needs to be developed.
Experts are talking about the technology that is still in its infancy, because it is not known what impact marine energy will have on the environment.
For now, the facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small and do not seem to cause major problems with the ecosystem.
However, in order to produce more energy, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the average.
Methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fears that are interconnected.
The power of the wave, which moves with the fights up and down, is changed with the help of cylinders and cylinders at the hydraulic pressure inside these fights.
The pressure rotates the turbine, which supplies energy to the generator.
Energy gets to the shore by submarine cables.
For now, there are four such facilities at the project stage, which are only waiting for federal approval and part of the energy could be used for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is now producing energy for the mall and parking lot using six PdM turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of water during the inflow and outflow causes the turbine to rotate, which by this rotational motion feeds the generator.
Verdant stated that they have a long list of customers who are waiting for the necessary authorization due to the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
At this point, special interest deserves the potential of inflow and outflow, they say at the Institute for Electrical Energy Research.
Although this is an independent factor, inflow and outflow are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
States such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and predicted investments of up to 35 million dollars in 2009.
