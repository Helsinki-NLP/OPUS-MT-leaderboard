Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech: Moving on to the last moment?
It's all possible
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transition.
Another chance will come in the winter.
Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, currently Chelsea's replacement goalkeeper, is now not sitting above a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits at the Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chovsk<0xC3><0xBD> NH Hotel, talks to Czech journalists and is going with the Czech team to play with the Americans and then also to the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualifier against the Netherlands.
In the new Premier League season, Thibaut Courtois takes the lead in Chelsea, the Czech side for the first time in ten years at the London club.
It has long been speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech Republic.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup at the start of the season in a match against Atlético and failed to enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He scored two wins and two draws for the French league season, scoring St. Etienne 5–0 on Sunday.
Relatively the shoe is pressed by AS Monaco.
He has a 1-1-2 balance in the league so far, and on the weekend he broke up with Lille 1:1.
On the English boulevard websites today, there were reports that the Czechs might want to go to the Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, Chech’s departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet gave him a 4:1 course.
Peter, is it possible that you will change your shirt in the next few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never anything 100 percent in football.
Perhaps during the day there will be an offer that will not be refused.
What would such an offer look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know yet how such an offer, which can't be rejected, actually looks.
It would have to come to an agreement between all sides. First of all, it would be up to Chelsea to decide whether or not the club would deal with the offer.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transition when you are in Prague?
Wouldn’t it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new establishment?
So I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation, there are a lot of players today, all are somewhere on representative matches and certainly a lot of crossings will be closed today.
So somehow, it would be feasible.
How many clubs are there on the planet that you can afford?
Well, I really don't know.
So you don't want to go?
The situation where I didn’t want a new season in the first three games is new to me after fifteen years of career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack and go somewhere.
I want to continue to take part in the fight for the position of Chelsea goalkeeper and it is up to the coach to choose who will make the decision over the next few weeks.
What role does your family play in your decision-making?
I take into account all the factors.
It is of course a sport for me, but I also look at it from a personal point of view, to which the needs of the family of course belong.
Is it possible for you to catch another club in England?
That's a question that I thought would never concern me.
In football, anything is possible.
I don't want to exclude anything.
I don't know the answer.
Presidents of India and Japan to meet in Tokyo
The new Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Tokyo to meet with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe on his first major visit since May’s victory in the elections to discuss economic and security commitments.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to establish economic ties with the world’s third-largest economy.

Police in Karrat arrested a 20-year-old boy after motorcycle chase
They stopped the engine after a zone with a maximum speed of 70 km/h fired at 125 km/h and entered the bush to escape the police.
In the morning, the traffic police in Karrat tried to stop the blue motor when they noticed that he was driving 125 km/h at the exit of the Bathgate Road pumping station.
According to police, the driver did not stop and continued along Burgess Road and then went into the bush, so the police lost him out of sight.
The motorist and the person who corresponded to the driver’s description were then seen in a house in Walcott Way, Bulgaria.
Karrath police have accused a 20-year-old man of failing to comply with the call for arrest and impeachment.
He will appear before the court in Karrat on September 23.
The bike was amused for three months.
George Webster Accused of Rape in Hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
The man will be put on trial on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was indicted during a hearing at the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
On June 7, 2013, he allegedly raped a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire.
Webster attacked her while "she was unconscious, asleep, and unable to give her consent," according to the statement.
Webster is also charged with raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date of the translation on 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
The restoration of a very American ideal that labor rights are at the same time human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law that is designed to protect the organization in the professions as a civil right.
“In terms of how the departments work, middle-class jobs work,” says Ellison, a Democratic Senator for Minnesota who is the co-chair of the Congressional Committee.
That is why I am so proud to be able, together with John Lewis, to introduce a law that strengthens the position of employees.
This breakthrough legislation will give workers the same legal options as preventing discrimination in the organisation of professions, as in other forms of discrimination – and will stop the anti-communist forces
To amend the Labour Relations Act so as to enable all employees who face discrimination, if they want to engage in the professions, to stand trial before a civil court - and to judge damages or damages - is a correct and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative – at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other proposers in the bill is to re-attach the American ideal.
Despite the professional struggles that have taken place in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states — Americans once supported countries around the world to accept, expand, and respect labor rights.
There have been times, and millions of Americans still remember them when the country, with one breath, promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Toja's military autocracy would be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their departments were playing a role in shaping a new Japan, including language, and openly recognized that "the right of employees to assemble, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, and therefore included a clause that says openly: “The right to create societies that will guarantee security and better working and economic conditions will be a choice for each and every professional.
Agreements that will restrict this right or seek to damage it will be terminated. Measures leading to the fulfillment of such a purpose are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, the drafters and the drafters of Roosevelt's draft included them in the draft.
Americans throughout the generation have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When countries worked for other countries to create civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create labor unions — and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as equal partners — must be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the power of the nation has not diminished, but expanded it.
They have raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry, and raised production to an unprecedented level.
Those who attack the profession forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and we shouldn't either.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights – and the extension of the protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination in the organisation of professions – is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have lifted America and made it a true promise to democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that, according to lawyers, is likely to shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
A regulation signed by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is due to enter into force on September 1, would require doctors performing abortions to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge’s decision means that doctors can temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions and, in the meantime, must obtain this permission.
“The proposing party will be able to legally operate its activities and in the meantime will get permission,” said federal judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a longer-term resolution concerning the law.
Activists for the right to abortion, which is the latest in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said that it will give doctors more time to get permission.
“Today’s decision assures women in Louisiana that they will be safe from the toxic law that is supposed to prepare them for health and their rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who filed a complaint on behalf of three out of five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also concerns physicians from the two clinics who were not among the plaintiffs, and also ask for this authorization.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures unconstitutional.
Key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Women’s rights advocates, together with the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need to have this permission puts on doctors requirements that are not necessary from a medical point of view.
Opponents of abortions have argued that the measures are aimed at protecting women’s health, and some have also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed because of the measures.
According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, only one doctor in Louisiana is allowed to perform abortions.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure out of fear of his safety, the group said.
The Louisiana authorities said in response that they would not punish the doctors who perform the abortions while waiting to settle the application for the granting of the rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, they kill more often on rural ovarian cancer
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video with their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
The researchers analyzed medical records of more than 1,100 Australians diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived five years after diagnosis.
Research lead Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
MAL<0xC3><0x81> STUDIE: New drugs may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The women’s researchers followed the treatment for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate was found in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that the factors may be a late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
“The disease is best treated by gynecologists who usually live in larger cities,” she said.
Despite the improvement of remote medical services that are to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transportation services that will allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are healing far from their years.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of geographic location, highlighting the need for better treatment and preventative programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, Gold Coast’s young mother, Elisha Neave, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret a reduction in the number of homeowners
According to the HTA study, published by the Financial Times, a decline associated with the extraordinary loss of homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to the fact that up to today’s young generation of consumers reach “the main age group of gardeners”, the garden centers will reach a million acres.
According to the report, people who rent housing will spend an average of 55% of the amount that people who live in their homes spend in their gardens.
As a further threat to the industry, which earns an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion a year, it cites an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas where there are no gardens, a preference for irrigation rather than for pre-garden used as a parking space, and a decrease in the size of the garden.
In the Greater London area, where the share of owned homes has fallen from 61% to 43% over the past six years, the lowest spending on garden products in the UK is for one household.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society said that living in a house or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardener for RHS, said: “The tenants have a very popular growing plant in flower beds – when they move, they can take the plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the ‘golden age’ of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
Also this year, he predicted a higher turnout thanks to better weather, which came after unfavorable conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern Dictator speaks of democracy.
After Putin, at the meeting of his youth organization, which most reminds me of Hitlerjugend, saved me with nuclear weapons and basically showed everyone that their opinions were stolen from him, he gave us today a lecture on democracy.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia shows many features of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can control both drunken nationalism and the fact that the inferiority complex can transform into imperialist guinea pigs.
Time seems to be different in the east than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of the wars of domination over Europe was long gone, in the East, on the contrary, it thinks that they have been overlooked for a long time and it is necessary to regain its international position.
Such a mood and frustration prevailed in Germany in the 1930s, just before the seizure of power by the Nazis, and then followed an explosion of nationalism unlike today’s situation in Russia.
And then the very similar cult of a strong leader, the slaughter of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, is indeed quite similar.
Vladimir Putin and certainly most Russians are probably missing out on the time when Russia ruled half of the world and the second part was trembling in front of them.
Perhaps the Western politicians blamed it on themselves, perhaps little Vladimir was crying on his shoulder, maybe they didn’t invite him where he wanted to be, and maybe they started to underestimate him, and he just behaved like a typical Russian man.
He made a deal at home, pretended that he didn't want to go anywhere, and brushed his knife at home.
Now he has decided to return to the lost position.
It starts slowly, it has time.
The leader's probably on life, so where would he hurry?
He smelt the Caucasus, now smelt the Ukrainians, then there are a number of dwarfs from the Baltics.
You've been stabbing a Russian bear in a fur coat for a long time.
China will surely notice this, too, which somehow jumps out too much and is certainly making its mark to the far east.
And the Germans of that Vladimir are also pretty proud of how well they're doing, and I gave them that ass in 45.
How to make a new Novorossiy in Karlovy Vary.
That would be the foundation and ours are a lot there, and how they print them there and the dacha they already want to spoil to the reader of them.
After all, our veterans still remember how they used to be in Czechoslovakia.
Well, their prime minister, Mr Sobotka, is so soft, can be peeled like onions and I eat their whole EU.
It would play so much that they could jump on the big Russia.
They need to be reminded where their place is.
And as explosives, we'll use our privateers who live in their territory.
The Russians are everywhere, and if they say they're pushing them there, they're just pushing them there, and we're not going to let that happen, we're going to protect them.
And again, Russia will rule, for to what else it is born.
After all, Europe is only as good as a presenter, on which proud Ivan can dance a Cossack.
Turkey calls for U.S. diplomat over spying report
Turkey’s foreign minister has called on the country’s highest-ranking U.S. diplomat to explain the report on U.S. and British espionage activities in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. charge d’affaires and Turkish state officials had been negotiating the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept said that according to documents provided by the former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target of the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has downplayed the importance of the report and said that all major states are watching each other.
An earlier report, which the German news service also focused on Ankara, prompted a more outraged response from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones series introduced other tricks of the fourth series
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth series of the cult series.
At the same time, they praised the way in which the fourth series of tricks were created.
The most visible are the computer adaptations of the serial environment and the mass scene, when the great army of the famous Daenerys will become from the sound of soldiers.
Magaluf police chief accused of corruption
Complaints on Friday presented the Mallorian State Prosecutor’s Office with evidence of extortion by police officers and state officials of the town hall in the Calvia Autonomous Region.
The director of police in Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested on charges of high-profile businessmen and bar owners in the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after he was accused of corruption by several Punta Ballena businessmen, the street where most of the bars and nightclubs in Magaluf are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, on Friday, the complainants presented to the prosecutor of the Mallorcan Office for the Suppression of Corruption evidence of extortion by police and state officials of the municipality in the autonomous region of Calvia.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish state police for their involvement in the corruption charge and, together with Navarre, the judge will hear them.
The Spanish national daily ABC quoted disgruntled owners of night businesses as saying that the benefits of public actors have a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money a long time ago, it's about surviving," one of the entrepreneurs told the court.
Don't mess with our lives.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines around the world after an 18-year-old British tourist video appeared on YouTube that provided oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to monitor the drunks and extortionists in a number of participants at the holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of infamous alcoholic tours around the bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where an oral sex event took place, was forced to close for a year and together with the organizers of a tour of the Carnage bars to pay a fine of 55,000 euros ($73,000).
The Magaluf tourist resort, which is popular especially with the British, has also witnessed many alcohol-induced accidents including fashionable waves known as "balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring marked by rain and storms that had an impact on flight at Adelaide Airport
JARO brought the South Australian ice surprise, came with heavy rain and strong winds, which seriously hit the airport in Adelaide.
Another 5 mm of precipitation is expected to fall in the city until nine o’clock in the evening and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night on Sunday.
The last rain came along with a few short overhangs associated with storms and gusts of wind that began about eight o’clock in the evening and in about ten minutes brought almost 4 mm of precipitation.
After several early doses of spring arrived after winter last week, temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to just 15.8 <0xC2><0xB0>C.
The storm weather is believed to have contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a change in speed or wind direction and was forced to delay landing.
Wind gusts at the airport in Adelaide at that time reached the ground at a speed of about 50 km/h.
The flight data showed that the plane had to leave from the second landing and finally arrived at about 20:40.
The delay in the aircraft subsequently caused further delays, including Emirates flight from Dubai and Qantas flight from Sydney.
According to the forecast, temperatures in Adelaide on Tuesday will reach a maximum of 16 <0xC2><0xB0>C and one or two thunderstorms may occur.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in anti-bomb shelters, while during the fifty-day war between Israel and Hamas, rockets and mortars attacked their homes. However, schools in Gaza are fighting back.
The beginning of the school brought to communities in southern Israel noted attacks of feelings of joy and excitement, but signs of fighting are still visible.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, the school staff hit by a rocket removed the remains from the walls along the rooftops and are slowly waiting for the children to return.
"We're a little scared, but we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a kibuco resident of Saad and an English teacher at the local school.
A lot of kids in this area really need to go back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it was "a bit strange" to go back to school at once.
"We had a couple of difficult moments and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
Kibuc, located near the Gaza border, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the people.
Until the ceasefire last week ended, thousands of border settlers such as Saad stayed inside their homes or their homes and set off to safer areas away from Gaza to avoid rockets and mortars.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a village near the Gaza border, in which she shot a four-year-old boy from a Palestinian minomet, with a return of weight.
The Minister of Education said that about 12 families still did not return.
Their children were temporarily placed in secondary schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town on the Gaza border that was heavily hit by a Palestinian fire.
He instructed the children to study diligently, adding, “We will ensure your education and safety.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on a timeless peace on Tuesday.
While the ceasefire led to an immediate end to the fighting, it did not resolve key issues such as Hamas’s demand to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopen airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers who fell in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel questions these figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were radical, although there is no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortars during the fighting on Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli military has again carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have been hiding in hundreds of UN schools that have turned into temporary shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people who still remain in hiding, and because of the ongoing fighting, last week, school officials postponed the start of the school year.
“I hope they will open the school soon so that we can complete our education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from the school in Gaza’s largest city.
I'm behind the curtain, I'm behind the curtain.
The Lafatu disturbs the temperature
The Czech national football team met in Prague before Wednesday's preliminary match with the United States and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualifier against the Netherlands.
Of the thirty-three members of the cadre, the Spartan striker David Lafat has problems, which is plagued by temperature.
David isn’t here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players and David still has a little bit of those problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"Whether it's two or three days or it's going to be fit tomorrow, it's going to be seen according to his medical condition, which our doctor will decide," he added.
The other players are fine.
“Of course, someone has some kind of pain, but it’s not that they can’t train or participate in the game on Wednesday with the United States,” the Czech coach said.
On Sunday evening Vrba called as the last player of the Spartan reserve Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> V<0xC3><0xA1>ch.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision to make, and other midfielders seemed to consider it.
I decided based on the fact that Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> is a promising player, who is 25 years old.
It was a very difficult decision, but I am behind it," Vrba told V<0xC3><0xA1>ckov.
What about Shural?
We'll see what happens to Latata
It is not excluded that in the case of health problems, the nomination could still change.
On the weekend, for example, the libertarian Josef <0xC5><0xA0>ural, who gave the hattrick, performed brilliantly.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
We'll see how David Lafayette is doing.
In the event that there is no power available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot nominate any of the players who were interested in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon there is a training session at Strahov, then on Tuesday a classic pre-match training in front of a duel with the USA on Summer, which will be open to fans and followed by an autograph.
The match with the Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team in it will strive for a premier victory under Vrbo.
In the previous three pre-match games, he scored two draws and lost once.
The qualifying match against the Netherlands is then on the programme on 9 September from 20:45.
Pe<0xC5><0xA1>ice goes to the Netherlands to Italy
Vrba is happy to have more time for training, unlike previous encounters.
There is an advantage when you have players eight days and you can train with them certain things that we may not have had so much time for before.
Now we will be able to focus only on getting ready for the Netherlands as best we can," Vrba said.
Before the match in Prague, the Dutch will present themselves on Thursday in Italy and the duel will be personally followed by former temporary representative coach Josef Pe<0xC5><0xA1>ice.
He'll give us the information that's out of the game.
But it's not just about him, we're going to have a match and a shot and we're going to pick him up.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes there will be," Vrba told bronze medalists from the recent World Championship.
According to the highly monitored statistics, the price of apartments in the winter period has increased the most in the last seven years.
According to the Housing Value Index in the Australian capital, Data CoreLogic Hedonic rose by 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual increase in prices amounted to 10,9 %, more than double for one year until August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
Data Tim Lawless, head of research at RP, said that Sydney and Melbourne are leading the market.
RP Data figures show that prices of apartments in Sydney last year increased by 16.1%, while prices in Melbourne by 11.7%.
Among the other strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with prices rising on average between five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale, Canberra was placed, which damaged the state’s ordered spending cuts and where prices increased by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has begun, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the continued high rate of auction sales, generally high rate of sales and low interest rate, it is likely that the value of housing will increase even further over the next three months,” he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said to me, "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
They had a colder relationship with their father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked at the factory.
Henry tries comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary interview with his father and is part of the Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with a few unpleasant memories from his childhood.
After his mother's death, Henry underwent "in-depth" therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You’ve never seen his face, you’ve just heard his voice: “Stop that frame.
Leave your sister alone.
Get out!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton – when I was a kid, they were already adults – went to the bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a kick in cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
For most of my life, he was a serious guy in a corner reading a newspaper.
Henry had recently visited the Dudley Brewery, and although the conditions were better than in his father's time, he looked at what life must have been like for him.
Today there's a little more light out there, but it's still a dark, smoky, cloudy labyrinth where flames erupt and there's a lot of smoke and sap.
My dad always went into the bathroom and just lay there, and then he could hear him slowly start singing for himself, because he was washing the sink away.
When I walked around, I realized that I had been doing this for years to enjoy the family, and I started to appreciate it more.
Yet Henry lived a childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hug anyone, he didn't say, "I love you."
When Mom was sick and dying, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, who he has with Dawn Frank, allowed him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Don't keep hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
With Frank, whom he has been married to for 25 years, they are still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had sugar.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of excess weight, and the symptoms of diabetes started to manifest, the doctor told me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to the big fitness center and also I had to follow a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tiresome.
No one wants to eat the same carrot.
A change in the direction of Henry’s career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut chin.
After receiving recognition from critics for his Othello, he plunged into the theater.
It was followed by a comedy full of mistakes and plots by August Wilson.
It’s a different experience than sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ noticed him on the stage as he parodied someone and wrote about him in the New Faces talent competition.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: “For a long time I was the only black impersonator/comic on television.”
He learned to walk.
In addition to having to be noticed by the public, I also had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to come up with functional jokes, be a star and perform on television and it was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Because his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors dressed as blacks, Henry eventually performed in it with his comedy for five years.
My family was already sick because of this.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was “the award-winning major product of British television for years and years” was also “a grotesque parody of blacks.”
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedic circles and introduced characters who at the same time ridiculed and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known, among other things, as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
The next decade took him advertising, documentaries, television shows, and roles in movies, but after he aired his LennyHenry.tv show on the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what you're going to do now, Lene, it's kind of like you're stuck in one place."
Next in line was a documentary series on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy to Shakespeare.
We didn't learn it well in school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we had an interview with on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get involved when you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented twenty lines of Othello's final speech for the document, and he was already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it gives me courage.
“That’s about it. It’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, learn something about it.
So the test was tough and I've been reading this game for months and months.
And it was a success.
It looked like they were waiting for a breakthrough, which didn't happen.
Soon he began to play in a comedy full of mistakes.
All of a sudden, I was at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point I thought, “You’ve changed.”
There was a technical breakdown, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for entertaining the audience.
“The voice in my head said, ‘Before you fix the computer, you have to have ten minutes of fun.’ ”
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Hmm, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve this for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry v Plotech v Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of the Plots was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it delivers determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like a sign from God that says, "This is what you should do."
Of course, that's what the loud voice says.
So I'm staying with that.
I really like it.
I'm happy in the rehearsal room.
Henry, however, remains the brain of the comedian – all the while our conversation interrupts with humorous performances as he enters and exits the role of the impersonator.
I decided not to do stand-ups, because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, I would say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into the blind alley.
Sometimes, when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I don't enjoy it as much as before.
I asked him if he ever planned a stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in one room with a director who helps give outlines of the beginning, middle and end of the road – I don’t think I’d ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I like acting.
It's fun.
You're still telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya Registers State Officials to Enlighten Non-Existing Employees
Kenya began with the biometric registration of all its state officials to try to remove non-existent employees from the payroll of the government.
According to a statement by the government, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will no longer receive a paycheck.
The government believes that thousands of people are getting paid even after they leave the state service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to prevent corruption in the state administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the state is coming at least one million dollars a month (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) in salaries of non-existent employees and other abuses of official power.
The government suspects that payments are still being deposited into bank accounts even after the death of an employee or after an employee leaves the state administration, said Wanyama Chebusiri, a BBC reporter from Nairobi.
All state officials will be required to arrive at identification centres within the next two weeks, where their data will be biometrically recorded, the government said in a statement.
Furthermore, he says that anyone who fails to make a sufficient apology will be excluded from the bill of lading.
“By identifying the actual employees of the public service, this measure will make a significant contribution to its under-employment and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees,” said Anne Waiguru, Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Dozens of Turkish Police Officers Arrested for ‘Shut Up’ Against Government
According to local media, a total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of “insulting against the government”.
The police have not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, there were 14 high-ranking officials among those detained.
Some of them were involved in the December corruption investigation, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and telephone interception.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time the prime minister) described their actions as part of the actions of the Islamic cleric Fethullah G<0xC3><0xBC>len against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine.
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yace<0xC5><0x88>uk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that it was decided to defend the country for the next generation:
Not all schools had a traditional ceremony on September 1st.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk, visited by Jacenuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Ron Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for tough times
Take with you the clouds of fame from the world of banking, media management and the internal conclave of the conservative party.
He has experience from the front lines.
She began her career at Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and into the media world of Pearsons.
She served as Executive Director of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when the highest position in Pearson's parent company was held by her younger colleague.
It is said that her distance was close to a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Brown, the former BP director, when Cameron in Whitehall needed private expertise: she became an adviser to the government.
Her husband is a former member of the City Council.
In May, I described the director's job as a horse-drawn carriage.
Not only is the BBC a vast and online entity at the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation is turning in two directions: inside the top layer of the hierarchy of the BBC’s own leadership, but also out to the voice of the public in times of turmoil when things don’t work.
It is an almost unsustainable monopoly that demands a thorough reform.
Which director, however, would risk coming to a company complex like the Chinese dynasties, will distribute it and thus prepare himself for work.
It's a tough challenge.
Had it not been so difficult, many people would have liked to see the BBC shrink – its power, its finances – and how its status is being revised.
With the expansion of the competition and the new technology questioning the old security, immediate negotiations on concessional fees for the BBC are in grave danger.
For a modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British public buys a stake in something that is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of the household and costs only 40 pence per day.
In addition, the BBC’s popularity is clearly rising: 53% of fans versus 31% ten years ago.
BBC service usage models have changed: Today, news headlines appear to me on my mobile phone and on the shows I’ve been through, I can watch on the iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very loving and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Gov. Perry Says He Didn't Approve the Ugly Tweet
A tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, which was released on Sunday, contained an offensive image of a Democratic State Representative who initiated Perry’s criminal charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another one was posted on Perry's account, which was distanced from the previous one.
There was a tweet from my account that was not authorized.
"I disagree with the tweet and I downloaded it," he said in another post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the questions right away.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry’s official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet published a non-harmful, humorous picture of Travis County State Representative Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay the money for her office, which led Perry, a possible candidate for president in the 2016 election, to a grand jury in Austin this month.
The tweet read: “I don’t always drive with three times the level of alcohol in my blood than the limit is allowed... but when I do, I complain to Governor Perry that I am responsible for that.”
I'm the hottest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by Lehmberg's office.
He was cared for by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and called the indictment a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked the supervisory judge on the case to reject the charge, because the use of laws to prosecute the longest serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry has suspended the $7.5 million disbursement from the state fund for the public interest advocacy department, which is based in Travis County and is prosecuting corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The refusal caused a formal complaint by a left-wing group of civic activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it's even celebrated.
After finishing fifth on his party’s committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might have ended up tweeting his own photo of him running near the lake and saying, “Here I am, South Carolina!”
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning “to normal”
One of London’s most prominent development companies has warned that the housing market in southeastern England has “returned” to a normal level of activity.
Living in the capital was the subject of high demand and rising prices, and widespread concerns about the credit bubble prompted the Bank of England in June to introduce limits on mortgages.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the developer company for Berkeley’s demanding clients, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned from a peak in 2013 to a normal level of transactions.”
The London housing market was doing well during the downturn, as buyers from abroad flooded the capital.
According to the cadastral authority, prices in the city jumped by 18.5% last year alone, far exceeding the average of 6.7% in England and Wales.
The average selling price of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about five per cent last year, and by the end of April it was <0xC2><0xA3>423,000.
However, because of the amplification of the books, they are not so attractive in recent months for foreign buyers of London real estate – some of them have also threatened the introduction of new property taxes and talk of possible “residential taxes” with which politicians came before the parliamentary elections.
London-based real estate firm Foxtons last week warned that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter rules for loans, would also slow the pace of market growth in property sales and prices during the second half of the year.
The new data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of mortgages approved for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate office, has reduced its forecast for London real estate prices to 3% in 2015 due to the fact that home prices have already begun to fall.
The volume of transactions, according to the real estate office of WA Ellis, has fallen by a quarter each year in London’s most expensive districts such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington.
Still, the demand for housing in the capital city of Berkeley was a blessing as it increased cash for forward sales to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, well-looking housing in a good location remained the same and as a result the forward sale was maintained.”
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million, revenues by 18% to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
On Monday, ahead of Pidgley’s annual meeting, he said that Berkeley’s annual revenues are expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
The stock of Berkeley stopped at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 at the London Stock Exchange this afternoon.
Hacker posted nude photos of Jennifer Lawrencov<0xC3><0xA1>
Jennifer Lawrencov<0xC3><0xA1> is coming to the Academy’s 85th Annual Prize.
Oscar holder Jennifer Lawrenc’s photos have escaped to the internet because of a hacker who claimed to have a “list” of photos of hundreds of other beginning actresses.
A spokesman for Hunger Games confirmed that Lawrenc's photos were correct and criticized the hacker for "a blatant violation of privacy."
The authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrencov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Hacker photos, which were originally published on the 4chan image-sharing server, reportedly got thanks to the gap in the Apple iCloud web storage system. The alleged list of photos of the hacked victims by BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of Karshidan stars,
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, however, the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim Against the Rest of the World" Winstead also criticized the action on Twitter.
“I hope that those of you who look at the photos we took with your husband years ago in the privacy of your home are happy with each other,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known from Nickolodeon's cable TV series "iCarly" and "Victorious", denied that the photos were true. On Twitter, she said: "These are my alleged nude photos are PODVRH, people."
It's better to tighten it up even in the crack.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday evening that pop star Ariana Grande’s spokesman denied that the alleged photos were true.
An extraordinary example from Howard Jacobson’s acclaimed new novel about love and the letter “J”
They disintegrated, it's the best way to describe it, gradually dissipating like a cardboard box someone left in the rain.
Only from time to time did a woman tell him that he was too serious, complex, sharp, isolated, and perhaps a little lazy.
And then she shook his hand.
He admitted it to himself.
He could pee, like a rat, yeah.
The last victim of this ability was the beginning of a love quarrel, which more than usual promised to ease him from the lonely boredom of life, and perhaps to give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild gray hair and a flying heart from the village on the northern island, which was even farther and more hospitable than Port Reuben.
To the south came an older companion, whom Kevern thought to be her aunt, who inherited property in a wet but beautiful valley called, conveniently, the Valley of Paradise.
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes said, there were dead spiders in the baths, the slugs signed in a slip on the windows, as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled the huge heads of the deer.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, scary and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
A further selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on the folding chairs in the long grass and held their hands, enjoying an unexpected warm spring afternoon, unpretentiously setting up a public station, which supplied the region with pleasant music and soothing messages, which sneezed at him in the blink of an eye.
You've got too big legs.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they no longer played such songs on the radio.
They weren’t banned – there really wasn’t anything banned – they just didn’t play.
They helped them get into desuetuda, as did the word desuetudo itself.
People’s taste has proved what regulations and attitudes would never do outside the law, and just as people, as far as books are concerned, choose memoirs in which the poor become rich, cooks and love novels, so ballads are chosen in music.
Kavern let the day go by and began to play the imaginary piano and with a rough, comedic voice he sang the Serenade with Aillin's big feet.
The family didn't understand.
"It was a favorite song from jazz pianist Fatse Waller," he said, automatically adding two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started out as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him that he was playing the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth at the words that started with j, it cost you pennies.
It wasn't much fun at the time, and it wasn't funny even now.
He just knew it was expected of him, it was the whole thing.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn never heard of anyone.
Even jazz, even though it was not built directly outside the law, did not play.
Improvisation came out of fashion.
In life, there was only one place for “if.”
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where it would end up.
It's the same with humor.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the humor of the song.
Even though he hadn't heard of Sammy Davis Junior for ten years, Kevern knew jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to say Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn’t remember the time when popular singers weren’t black.
Also without laws or pressure.
A lazy society is one in which every part of it with gratitude – with gratitude of those who have been fortunately saved – agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin with temperament and constitutions were good for fun and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if it were nature’s gift to electronics, took responsibility for the fact that no family would be without a functional phone.
The Poles who stayed were the installers, the Greeks who stayed, they washed the dishes.
Those of the states of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose ancestors did not quickly leave the land, while it was happening, what it was, why it happened - they were afraid that they would accuse them of putting them in the fire, in fact they feared that the fire would consume them, and they were afraid that the next time the fire would consume them, they would burn them,
To each according to his talent.
Since she was just listening to the ballads, Ailinn could hardly understand how music could have arisen from the loose words that Kavern had just sung to her.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really frivolous," Kevern said.
Maybe only for people who have too big legs.
My father never hit anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden provided an illusion of security.
Even a word could not escape from the sound of the leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he dared to put two fingers to his mouth again in her presence.
She already thought it was weird.
'He seemed funny, 'he said at last.
Unbelievably, she shook her head and overshadowed Kevern's view.
All over the world, nothing was seen but the mess of her ravenous hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you think so," she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
She didn't walk like that.
Maybe some anklets...
You say you hate me because I have too many fat ankles?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles are just attracting me," he tried.
I'm a little shy.
That didn't work out.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he often got into trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to be able to tame the cruelty that was lurking in jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe he was deliberately cruel.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons sneezed and got out of the bed, hit the radio and poured unscented wine.
No wine, so he couldn't drink it.
She seemed to shake in her excitement like palm leaves in a storm.
"I'm mad that you're a fool," she said.
Except it doesn't appeal to me.
He felt sorry for her, both for her unkind words, and for the fear she had in her eyes at the time she stood up against him.
Did you think she was going to shoot her?
She didn’t talk to him about living on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but she didn’t doubt that it was basically the same as here.
The same wide and icy ocean was shaking over them.
The same confused men, then, CO SE STALO, even more invincible and crueler than their ancestors, smugglers, and casseroles, were furiously bloated from the pub to the pub, preparing to lay a hand on any woman who would dare to refuse them.
Blbec?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
To smear her first - to smear her became the most common expression for erotic irritability between a man and a woman: an antidote to the soft ballads of love, which the radio was whispering - she was first smeared, then a murderer.
According to Kevernov, over-cultivation, because breastfeeding was an act of violence in itself.
Ailinn Solomons unverbally suggested that he leave.
He got out of bed like an old man.
She felt herself blushing, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She was watching him leave - as if she were watching him from a window on the floor - a man who was haunted by what he had done himself.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart was shut for him and for all the men in general, no matter how few of them beat her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders bowed, disgraced, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she think she knew this view well, even though she could not equip herself with a single moment, until today, that she would ever see it?
Ailinn Solomons, again alone, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic twenty-year-old energy researcher working in Ofnow, a non-statutory monitoring system of Public Mood, prepared a short article on the persistence of light and medium-heavy forms of violence
"A lot has been done, and a lot has yet to be done," she wrote, "to calm the innate aggression of people who fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in crowded, hard-to-reach places of the land, where the swirling swirling from the peaks of the peoples only swirls over the peaks.
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the puddles.
The inhabitants breathe over sentimental ballads, swallow unhappy stories, and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas the old brutality is held as hard as in urban agglomerations, but also in the streets and streets.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too Mayan-style," said her superior.
I would suggest that you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum shook her head.
I have to ask myself, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme has once again reaffirmed her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
"That's why I'm not asking," Rabinowitz said, "that I should have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We have no prejudices in this workplace.
We serve an unaffiliated company.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which is entirely acceptable and praiseworthy in itself, can sometimes distort the judgment as you have shown it.
Obviously, you yourself are preoccupied with the Church — things you call “cruel” and “brutal” could also be interpreted by others as an expression of natural strength and energy.
To continue to solve what has happened, if it has happened, as if it had happened, yesterday, prepares the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was speaking, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head was a rose on the light board, a recommendation that Ofnow had broadcast to the world over the last quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
To speak is better than to be silent, a sung word is better than written, but there is nothing better than love.
"I completely understand your reservations," Esme Nussbaum replied quietly, as she was sure that her superior was finished, "and I do not claim that the morning did not go as we say it did.
My concern, in particular, is that if we are not warned in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what happened, if it happened.
This time, however, we will not vent our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz tied the ends of his fingers.
This should have meant infinite patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “when the steps that they may have taken and may not have taken by your grandparents are described as mistakes.
You’re also acting too far away from talking about venting your “wandering” and “untrusting” to “others.”
I shouldn't remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and protecting the present, we're not talking about "we" and "them."
There were no “we” and there were no “they.”
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
“During which, if we are honest with each other,” Esme said, “we are not without guilt.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened, it happened.
That was before.
There is nothing to add - we agree on this together.
And just as there is no guilt that could be blamed on anyone, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the correction was appropriate and possible.
But what does the past have to do with anything other than to learn from it?
The past exists in order to forget it.
If there's anything I can add to that--
Luther Rabinowitz cut off the ends of his fingers.
"I'll take your report into account," he said and let her go.
The day after she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hired her on the sidewalk in a way they described as “brutal and furious.”
Accidents happen.
The army of the Kingdom of Lesotho says no coup is planned - the prime minister remains in South Africa
Military officials in the Kingdom of Lesotho have denied that they would organize a coup to overthrow the government, claiming that they were acting against police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and says the army surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
After he declared that he was threatened with death, the prime minister went with his family to the neighboring South African Republic.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not actually a coup, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm.
“This morning, the command of the defensive units of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there are several groups in the police ranks planning to arm some radical political fanatics who were going to make a move in the country,” H<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> said.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
“Although no one has claimed to have seized government power by force, they are all said to have carried the actions of the Lesotho defensive components of the sign of the coup,” he said.
Military officials from the Kingdom of Lesotho said the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and there was peace in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjo Metsing will be in charge of the government.
Thabane said that in his view, the aim of the attack is to fight corruption in the country because of its efforts.
Since June, when Thabane has suspended parliament because of internal disputes, there has been tension in Lesotho.
He said that despite the contrary, he did not undermine his actions by the government.
Production in the euro area is at a minimum of 13 months
Production growth has slowed to a minimum of 13 months, according to a painstakingly monitored survey in the euro area in August.
The final index of purchasing managers in the euro area (PMI) from June 51.8 fell to 50.7 in August.
A number greater than 50 means expansion.
There have been new orders and factories have damaged the growing tension between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from a Thursday meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
The markets will want a clear plan from the bank on how to deal with the eurozone’s remote recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating to 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have hinted this week that he is considering the quantitative easing of the eurozone, similar to what the United Kingdom and the United States have joined during the financial crisis.
“While at least some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect that the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty have on the manufacturer is still more visible,” said Rob Dobson, Markit’s chief economist.
Germany’s manufacturing PMI, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to a 11-month low of 51.4.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, and Italy has gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force for growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands has disappeared are also not too reassuring,” Dobson said.
A slowdown in the industry is likely to put oil on the fire for analysts expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing about the production overview of purchasing managers in August is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “Manufacturers in the eurozone are living a very complex life at the moment, as increasing geopolitical tensions – especially between Russia and Ukraine – add even more uncertainty to increasingly challenging conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty has demonstrably impacted the business – especially consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially the costly ones.
He said that as "even more likely" it appears that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative easing, "although we expect it to be only limited."
10 years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: 10 years since the horrors of the busy school children still suffer
Ten years ago, thousands of people were held hostage by Chechen radicals at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
During the three-day suffering that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We went back to Beslan to look for some of the victims who escaped death during their school ferrets.
Exactly ten years after the terrible occupation of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people including 186 children, the surviving heroes were warned last night of the new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When on September 1, 2004, at the start of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to the tragedy combined the East and the West, which in this catastrophic accident led to negotiations and the future.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to look for some of the victims who escaped death during their school ferrets.
We have found amazing young people who have resisted misfortune, even though the memory of the hell caused by the terrorists in them will live on.
What is their greatest wish?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which the children as they were dying - is over.
Girl trying to get back into the destroyed gymnasium
She was captured by the leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov, as she was only trying to get back into the bombed-out school gym after a bomb exploded in her underwear.
The confused Aida desperately sought out her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
They were worried that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"Some woman told me to run away and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
I had legs from blood.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
She was rescued by a soldier.
After several surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said: “Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to have another operation.
There was a lump in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people as doctors have helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it definitely didn't destroy it," she said resolutely.
“It just happened to me and it can’t be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to our friends about it.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate, Jerry Gapoe, were killed there.
As a child, we played together and imagined how we would go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she didn't forget about the arrest, but the memories are a little pale every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture on the Internet as I walk down the school window, I say to myself that a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster, and stop it from happening again.
The boy who escaped the ball rain and believed his mother was dead.
It was his first day of school (in Russia the children begin school at the age of seven) and he survived a three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, “My mother told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the floor and hold her hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Flee."
He feared that she was dead, ran away and saw a crying baton along the way, grabbed the child by the hand, and ran away with a shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, “Damir told me his mother was dead.”
She says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was on her way to freedom, lying in the hospital with her injured leg, and on the contrary, she thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said, “I was crying with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and surrounded me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the missing News of the World) where then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie were declared the winner of Bernardo's Children.
"That horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are already pale.
I remember that right after that, I threw all my guns into play.
But today I can play the computer games in which it shoots, and I have no problem with that.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember the kids I used to play with in the yard who didn't get out.
We will never say that they were killed or that they died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
On a trip to London, I remember well, especially how I was able to choose whatever I wanted in the toy shop, and how I was riding a convertible.
But now he fears places like Ukraine, where he suffers from the war just as he and his friends suffered.
That horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
“I am terribly sorry to anyone who has to go through such a terrible ordeal,” says Damir, who took part in volunteer activities at the monastery last week.
I want to help a lot.
One day I want to work for the police, and I hope they'll take me to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children in our neighborhood, can you imagine that?
I remember the silence right after the attack, and there were no children screaming and running around, and it took a few months of silence.
He vividly remembers his journey with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say in person that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember how Damir had a taste for bourbon, and so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shooting at them from the water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month since the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world hasn’t changed for the better in those ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, every day people are dying and I think a lot of children will be killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something in the news that they listen to when they get bored or while they're doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a terrible thing it is.
I still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a nice and quiet boy from him, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn’t want revenge, he doesn’t care about it at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's very close to six colleagues, and from time to time they go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he had problems with it - I remember he used to lie on the couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes lay there for hours.
He didn't sleep, he had his eyes open.
I also remember that he threw all his guns or other weapons at play. Damir's 17 today, he's taller than me, nice, smart and healthy.
I can't believe I was sure for a few hours that he was dead and that I'd never see him again.
When I woke up after the explosion and stood on my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, pieces of human bodies lay everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my boy didn't have this damn chance to survive.
“I remember screaming, ‘Damire, run, run!’ but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life is different from the others.
Grigori Ilyin, 17
The boy whose photo was taken after the attack became a symbol of horror in Beslan
Rest: Beslan survivor Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatimou after the 2004 attack, right Grigory today
When he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his comrades, there was a deep fear in his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the Beast in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, planted him at school on his first day and hurried to take his older son Vladimir to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists broke into the court, so my boy stayed there for three days alone,” she recalled.
Not entirely alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it is increasingly difficult to think about it and talk about it.
There will not be a single day to remember this tragedy.
It doesn't feel like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back to me.
I promise that no one will ever forget.
Still-returning memories: Grigorije's Photo (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember the day Grigori was so excited to go to school, he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
That he's alive, I found out when I saw him on TV.
In San Marino, there is even a statue of the weeping Grigori.
Grigory dislikes this picture and at home we have it hidden in the library.
I understand that, but I also think that thanks to this picture, people around the world know how much pain we feel.
Today Grigory says: “It is important that this does not happen again.
“I doubt we’ll ever find out the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they're investigating the boeing accident in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what the cause was?
This world is waiting for something very bad.
“I don’t understand why it’s happening because when people ask, no one wants war as much as possible.
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To at least forget a little, it takes decades.
It had an impact on my health, and I still feel it.
I had three or four years because of a nightmare attack, but then it got better.
When I went back to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and colleagues who were killed.
That's why, as September 1 approaches, I'm going to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is the past.
I don't remember it, but I don't regret it.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiosurgeon.
First, I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't work.
Gorgory Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived despite being held at the feet of a murdering terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full force, he was captured trapped in a gym as he sat next to the bomb at the feet of a murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It feels like it was yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but was unable to do so due to injuries sustained during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I've been putting on my head.
Now I’m older and it’s said that children with bad experiences can cope better – I have to say that’s not true.
“In 2006 I went to a psychologist and then I felt a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I'll never go back there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting on that well-known picture.
Surviving: Gregory Farniev today, on a laptop with his photo taken in hospital after the attack
This pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know that I don’t like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me at school.
When it comes to physical health, I'm fine.
I have to be careful with my knee, which I hurt myself, but I'm already walking normally.
But anyway, for health reasons, I couldn't attend and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical records, and they told me it wasn't possible.
My other favorite are the animals, so I went to the vet.
I did it the second year.
Learn how to treat all animals from "cats to cows".
He said: “I know I will never tell my children about it.
It’s not something kids should know about, and it’s not something they should experience at all.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “The pain will always be here.
It's inside and it's getting worse with the approaching anniversary.
I will attend the commemorative ceremonies.
I know Grigory's not going.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was there unlike me.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me, and here in Beslan, there are footprints everywhere.
It stays with us.
Gregory's an adult today, but he's gonna carry on with the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I'd say he's already outdone that fear by 50%, but he can't completely outdo it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbors were killed, and the pain only worsens.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift God could give me, but it hurts me the loss of the dead.
I know families in which other children were born, but also widows who were not married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now getting closer to our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past we were one friendly country, so how did we get to the fact that we are fighting together now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If we could just pick up all those rebels and throw them away as soon as possible.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who took a special command to safety
Saved: Alyon Tskaev is taken to a secure Russian special command (left).
Now she is ten (right) and she does not remember the tragedy at all.
In 2004, the world caught its breath when a Russian policeman took Alyon out of Beslan’s custody.
She was released by terrorists, but she was detained in the school gym by her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhara.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan is married again, and they have a daughter named Kristina after their dead daughter, Svetlana, with their new wife Svetlana.
The neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, does not remember the attack at all and has grown out of it a bright and happy girl.
A close friend stated that "it's a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids."
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep children away from the memories that the tenth anniversary commemorates.
You can understand why.

4 tips on how to get better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in taking photos or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment available.
The cheapest option is a compact such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition outdoor camera, which costs around $300.
I took these photos at a family celebration of several photographers, all of which cost less than $350.
It doesn’t matter what equipment you use, but a few rules apply to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are firmly closed.
Next, set the camera according to the type of photos or videos you will take.
Some cameras and camcorders have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes exposure to a dark underwater environment.
And before you get into it, find out how deep you can immerse yourself with your equipment.
Some cameras are designed only up to 5 feet, others up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide to the purchase and evaluation of digital cameras in both conventional and waterproof design.
Always make a few pictures - a lot of them won't come out.
Compact cameras have an LCD that helps you with the composition of photos, but outdoor cameras don’t have it.
Even if you have an LCD, underwater it will be poorly visible and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
So always make more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with a slightly different range of exposures, use it.
Stay close to the level.
With a deeper depth of light, it fades significantly.
If possible, stay in the pool, lake or sea close to the level when shooting.
This will also allow you to capture more light in the photos - the deeper you sink, the less colors you will see.
Get close to the photographed object.
This is great advice if you’re shooting on land, but underwater it’s even more important because of the dimming light.
This is especially important when shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide angle of the lens, which means that if you want to fill a photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality power was able to change things even in such a huge organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to relieving the sick from the pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an officer of MI6, who had to live with the consequences of torture that frozen him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnoses and disease, treated patients in the throbbing majority are interested in something completely different: pain.
However, one day in 2007 it was he who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He struggled with the symptoms of the flu and found out that he was impatient and included his wife Juliet with rashes.
He said, “I want everything to happen sooner rather than later.”
When Juliet went on a week-long service trip, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something wasn't right.
A colleague made him an X-ray of his chest.
He had been skiing in the French Alps for two weeks.
The results of X-rays came.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the cervix or if the lung protrusion.
For most types of cancer, it is difficult to determine what their cause was.
Although some smokers will get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer have smoked.
Mesothelioma is different.
Almost in all cases, it is the cause of exposure to asbestos - a building-fiber material that was previously referred to as "miracle", but today it is known to be fatally dangerous.
For most of us, it was not difficult to ignore the mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when it came into force to ban the use of asbestos in the industry.
Even at the time asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as the insulation depositors, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers.
The toxin used in the industry in a different era today hardly appears to be a cause for concern.
But this kind of self-pity is not there.
As it turns out, there is a mesothelioma epidemic in Britain today.
The number of deaths from mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per year are more than twice as many as the number of victims of car accidents.
Number of deaths due to mesothelioma annually since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in the UK
The reason why we are only now feeling its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades before the mesothelioma develops.
The mess in the form of mesothelioma does not concern only veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases still is, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the shops we shop in.
Mesothelioma, therefore, does not respect the social layer, wealth, profession or age.
Privileged gardens from London’s commercial houses to public schools do not represent a hideout.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we should be treated are the repository of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He didn't even think of isolation.
He was trying to figure out where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
“It’s possible that a lot of asbestos was in Guy’s Hospital basement corridors, where I spent six years in practice,” he wrote.
Everyone – students, nurses, doctors and returnees – used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question that he was able to answer in part.
“Of the four doctors who have been in practice at Guy’s Hospital and who have then been exposed to mesothelioma in the past five years,” he noted in a 2010 letter, “I am the only one still alive.”
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis for so long is not common.
55% of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always deadly.
Now, then, we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us have the same disease?”
According to the leading British expert on the mesothelioma of Professor Julian Pet, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain takes place, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die in this way.
Asbestos mines in Quebec, Canada
In a casual look at the records from the archives of the courts, to which the handicaps often turn and require equalization, it shows how much the mesothelioma has expanded.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted to exposing asbestos to Janice Allen out of concern.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she supervised two stores in the clothing section - one of the places was the company's flagship, the Oxford Street store.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today, she has two children, over 20.
"Before that happened," he says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never even thought in my dream that he could touch me in any way.
There are not many people who know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
It is named for its fibrous structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in construction.
Most often it is possible to find chrysotile in buildings today, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals, and even in brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, yet the EU and WHO consider it a “great health risk” that can cause death.
But the most dangerous is the brown asbestos (amosite) and the blue asbestos (crocydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos and experts claim that "there is convincing but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom]."
An employee of Marsk & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in a flagship store on Oxford Street in London.
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but the work of Juliana Peta suggests that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients claims that “a significant proportion of cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A significant part of this exhibition is caused by the "common use and ventilation" of buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even people in the center of the government may not have the slightest idea that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that service elevators and pipes behind the parliamentary committee’s rooms are contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fiber could be broken by something as harmless as a “strong stream of air.”
Ministers are often accused of caring only for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although the Parliamentary Services Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster receive a "good medical certificate", it is now expected that it will take <0xC2><0xA3>1 million and several years of work to have Parliament thoroughly examined, modernized the Westminster Palace and removed the electricity in 2015 and the electrified it from the ground.
The Goddard report states that “the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations.”
It is not possible to say whether this discrepancy will cost lives.
Now everyone can just wait.
One of the people who have never been able to determine when asbestos exposure occurred to them is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
As well as Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos was proven,” he says, “but in my case I can’t prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he managed to do something like a refrigerator.
He was 45, it was evening, and he was right in the middle of the operation.
All of a sudden, I'm upset.
It came at once.
I was awful.
I didn't think I'd get home by car.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from the groin, swelling around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to think it was mesothelioma.
He finally spent a month at home.
The mixed doctors made his chest X-ray and introduced his chest catheter to remove the fluid they sent for examination from his lung.
However, they did not identify the diagnosis.
His condition gradually improved and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, symptoms returned to him, often after he exercised and sighed.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients with similar symptoms came to the operating room and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and at work he came into direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray scans with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the space between the chest cavity and the pulmonary cavity.
I'm an optimist.
I tend not to take much,” he says.
To be honest, I wasn't too worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy came between Christmas and New Year: “They told me it was mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott: Diagnosed with Mesothelioma
Abbott began to meet with the sisters of the Macmillan charity, and one of them advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings that often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipe,” he says.
In people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, the disease is now beginning to manifest.
Mesothelioma, therefore, is now beginning to affect younger people who do not have a risky profession.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated tubes were found in hospitals in the basement, so it was unlikely that they would endanger patients.
However, members of staff who walked through buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) through the basement corridors or ate in the basement dining rooms (such as often Graham Abbott) definitely came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, several decades after the war, the hospital was a place where patients could save lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who treated them.
Asbestos has been eliminated to this day.
Students build Bunsen's kahan on asbestos substrates
It's not just a hospital.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and town halls because of its excellent insulating and non-flammable properties.
In schools, too.
In fact, many people have already been exposed to asbestos in school.
Somewhere in countless hours of chemistry, students built Bunsen's kahan on an asbestos substrate.
A web site has been created dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools.
Non-hazardous things like floor tiles or roofs of roofs on tools in our homes usually contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison built into a large number of homes,” said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma was able to remember was in the 1970s when a garden house was drilled.
So be careful how you paint a garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is huge.
“It takes a while for it to happen,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found that I can’t focus on what I’m doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized that I was going to have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I can't wait for another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from a doctor’s position to a patient’s position.
Like countless patients before him, he also remembers how confused he was by the amount of information he had to deal with.
“It was hard to understand all of this,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have left?’
I was told it was 12 months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I don’t have another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive, because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive – breathing itself – is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is a small fiber.
When the asbestos breaks down and the fiber inhales, they can settle in the groin, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers in the cornea irritate and can cause a mutation in cells.
“The problem is in the form of inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac surgeon who joined Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
In the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is paradoxically the leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson also knew and treated other patients who were likely to have been exposed to asbestos during hospital practice.
Asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, says Treasure, and “alone breathing pushes them to the edge where the protrusion is located.
It has been invasive from the very beginning.
On mesothelioma, the usual treatment options used in other types of cancer do not take as much.
The effectiveness of the operation is discussed, for example.
Some say it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the skull," he says.
You don't get a scalpel around her.
The cancer "does not respond too much to chemotherapy", which "has some effect", but does not cure.
“Sometimes there’s someone who survives lung cancer,” says Treasure.
But in the end, they're all gonna die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After discovering mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual supporter and adviser to equally affected people.
When they called, he was happy to say, “Good morning, you’ve reached the cancer center.”
“It was very positive,” Abbott says.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and was still very active.
At the beginning Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months, and would probably extend his life by only a month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give it up.
Lawson, however, “has shown things in a more optimistic light.”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the Department of Breast Surgery at Guy's Hospital.
“I had the advantage that I didn’t have to wait until they sent me to him, but I just called there and they looked at me,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get an application and they would have to approve the reimbursement.
In order to get the best treatment available, the money issue is key for patients with mesothelioma.
But when different treatments inevitably fail in the end, many patients face other financial worries - about the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they turn to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Since 1898, it has been known that asbestos is harmful to health,” Morgan says.
However, in the 1960s, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we meet with the company's negligence.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled, but Morgan said it was not a "full-fledged settlement" because Lawson could not definitively prove that the mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
However, after investigating the case, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed that "the asbestos in the incriminated subterranean section was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
Reducing exposure to deadly asbestos to a single company or workplace – usually decades after it happened – has proven to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
A lot of former jobs have changed the owner or failed.
The evidence of the insurance was lost.
And those who are now defending themselves have time on their side, which their plaintiffs certainly do not.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation has been passed this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to cope, even if it is not possible to track their former employer.
The law created a $350 million financial reserve, which is being guarded by insurance companies and is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos, but have no one to sue.
In this case, they will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally assign to them as compensation - approximately <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Each year, 300 successfully completed applications are expected to be submitted.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mesothelioma, thinks that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million is “good work.”
“It’s an agreement written by insurance companies for insurance companies,” he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if they didn’t take the time and people with mesothelioma would be able to look at former employers and make them normal.
Even Mike Penning, the former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law “had gaps.”
But Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths each year, a speedy negotiation was needed.
"People are suffering too much and need help right away," Penning said in December of last year during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Act.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunskiho for 19 months.
After initial consultations, he recommended the Lang-Lazdun operation, which, unlike Tom Treasurer, he thought had a positive effect.
Radiotherapy and chemotherapy were followed after the operation - a triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski could boast a five-year survival rate of up to 40% of patients.
Abbott made it stronger.
“Of course, that’s not the most important thing,” Abbott says.
You see it in patients all the time.
There is something that drives you.
When you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The control examinations showed no signs of the disease.
I went to another check in March [2014].
In the chest, I had a few spots [cancers].
My 50th birthday has just arrived.
It's not life threatening.
Take it.
Abbott re-entered six cycles of chemotherapy.
There are currently no traces of the tumor in his body.
It is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - about financial security when I die, or about showing a woman how the alarm clock works on the boiler.
When you hear bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look ahead.
As for Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it’s not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition means that I will never be old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She said it to her friends and suddenly a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations must be faced by all patients with cancer.
However, in patients with mesothelioma, such interviews do not relieve hope or just a sign of a chance of survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brought to Stephen Jay Gould) an unhappy certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma does not threaten life.”

Prohibition of the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful health claim as a result of exposure to asbestos in the UK.
Global production of asbestos is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tons per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139,000 tonnes.
The UK Institute for Health and Safety requires that all asbestos suppliers have a license.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the United Kingdom.
In the UK, the use of all types of asbestos is prohibited.
In the United Kingdom, the Mesothelioma Act comes into force.
A 350 million compensation program has been launched.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, white asbestos is still used as a cheap building material.
World production is held at two million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - protesters promise revenge
Despite the growing debate over democratic reform, China’s parliament on Sunday decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election.
It is likely that this move will trigger long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began organizing and arresting just hours after the announcement.
China’s People’s Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to nominate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
“It didn’t surprise us, but it angered us,” said Emily Lau, the Democratic Party’s president.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it is clear that we are dealing with the authoritarian regime.
In defense of the Chinese decision, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Fei said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong's leadership elections would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain returned China to Hong Kong’s administration, Beijing has promised that starting in 2017, the people will be able to vote in power.
China’s leaders presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong allows direct voting, but the decision also makes it clear that China’s top officials are firmly in the hands of the committee’s nomination process, which is tightly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which saw some of Hong Kong’s biggest and most watched protests in a few years.
For most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong, the Central Occupation Movement stands with love and peace, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial district if Beijing does not give them the general right to vote.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the occupation movement gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement is entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that in the coming weeks there will be waves of protests.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organisers said that the movement “considered the occupation of the Central just as a last step if all possibilities of dialogue were exhausted and there would be no other choice.
We must announce with regret that today all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and that the occupancy of the Central is inevitable.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing’s announcement for days, strengthening the protection of the government’s headquarters and displacing police officers and barricades on Sunday.
Inciting unrest is, according to many Hong Kong residents, a sign that they are slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in the area of products and services.
There is also growing concern that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being undermined by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Central Occupation Movement and say that their demonstrations threaten the trade - the Hong Kong lifeboat.
“The protest he’s talking about could cause far greater economic damage depending on how many people are participating and for how long,” said Regina Ip, a longtime critic of the movement.
We do not want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such a perception could hurt your investment.
China’s state media has also come up with reports in recent days that Democratic activists in Hong Kong are portraying them as Western-run agents.
In the summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which was attended by 780,000 participants - more than five percent of Hong Kong voters.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
Pre-election Agitka?
The league in Jihlava is named after the political movement
A small kick is played in the regional town of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina by about 1,600 amateur athletes.
And their highest competition is newly named Together for the Jihlava League.
It was named after one movement that goes to the October municipal elections.
In addition, the head of the small mine in Jihlava is Jan Mr<0xC3><0xA1>k.
"There was a rally where there was no problem," Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka said.
The situation around the first league of small miners was already addressed by the lawyers of the Jihlava City Council and recommended changing the system of allocation of grants.
Last year, according to the city’s website, a small mine received about one million crowns.
This year, there are hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure of a minor is not contrary to the law or the directives of the magistrate.
The situation, however, is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules for the allocation of grants and grants," said a spokeswoman for the Magistrate Radek Tulis.
To draw grants from the city and at the same time express as a small amount of support in the elections of one political party, it probably will not work anymore.
A similar demand from politicians has not yet come to the high-level "big" football.
That the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Regional Board, ODS Division or KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL 1 should be formed.
What about class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be pro.
On the contrary, I would like sponsors from a number of companies to turn to us," said Miroslav Vrz<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, president of the regional football association.
The head of small football of the other side and the movement to the name of the league does not let
According to the players of the small mine, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own area with six playgrounds, clothing and social facilities.
"For example, the pitch on the Stairs is not ours, we are there for rent," said Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Lape<0xC5><0xA1> of Starlet Jihlava.
The most suitable location would be the Czech mill.
But there will be, in my opinion, a meaningless area for skaters, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava," Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka said.
The mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that a small miner uses a field of artificial grass in the streets of Ro<0xC5><0xA1>ické and Na Stoup<0xC3><0xA1>ch, which are the property of the city.
We want to build playgrounds that have maximum use.
We are going to modernize or build sports venues at schools, which will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think there has been tremendous progress in the last few years for a little digging," Vymazal added.
Other political parties in the name of the league will not appear, according to Jan Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka.
We have limitations.
If someone from one field joins us in the partnership, we don’t give the other one there anymore,” he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Vold<0xC3><0xA1>n, a member of the City Council's Sports Committee.
"But let the voters judge whether Mr. Mr<0xC3><0xA1>k is using the Little Mint Jihlava Society and the city's funding for political purposes or not," he added.
U.S. Tradition Breaks Into University Life - Beginners Can Fly on a Jet
We are pleased to be able to respond to your request by launching the first luxury travel service for students in the UK.
In order to leave the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transportation options including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that the service also has its own security page.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to haul their stuff across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We are pleased that with our VIF (very important fresher - very important fresher) options this year, we will ensure that students arrive at the university with minimal nervousness and maximum luxury.
A spokesperson for the company said that due to the services have just started, they do not have any reservations yet, but added: "Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks."
The company also said that although students pay an annual tuition fee of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000, it expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today’s students are different in terms of expectations and wishes – it’s more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the right way to do it.
The National Union of Students, however, criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, said: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
A lot of students who attend university this month have to cope with the financial crisis before they throw away thousands of pounds for something as simple as getting on the track, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants can’t keep up with rising costs.
Feminists stand up to racism and police behavior after events in Ferguson
At the beginning of the month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed young man.
Those who are waiting for the funeral with their hands up are chanting, “Hands up, don’t shoot!”
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of unarmed young Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz recorded a shift in the online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer sex to race.
With the growing tension in the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perézov<0xC3><0xA1> noticed that the reaction of whites is 100% race-focused.
Compared to the reactions of the Negroes soon after the August 9 shooting, personal articles with headlines such as "thinking white over Ferguson" or "Feminism is not just about oppressing women" appeared relatively late.
According to Peres, this is an important change.
“I don’t think there are a lot of people in the feminist movement who would talk about race and superiority at that level,” she said.
People felt that what had happened had to be expressed.
This is characteristic of the crisis we are facing, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially defeated that they had to pay attention to it.
According to a professor of English at Ohio State University Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson highlighted the problems that African-Americans face every day and that are not perceived as “women’s issues” in the cultural sphere.
“I can post funny stories from my life with my partner on Facebook and it will get 150 characters from people from all over the world,” Mitchell said.
When I write something about the fact that the colors are in their own country in the trap, it is silence that is deafening.
“How is it possible that a woman can speak publicly about relationships, but not about security in the public space?” she asked.
For blacks like Mitchell, who have dealt with the issue of race, gender, and sexuality in American history, there is no difference between questions of race and sex dichotomy.
According to her, the Negroes could not afford the luxury to clearly divide these problems: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although whites today coincide the question of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor teaching women’s question and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched and the reason was, in almost all cases, the rape of a white woman,” Hattery said.
To justify the lynching, you needed the cooperation of the whites.
According to Hattery's split between whites and blacks came when campaigners like Susan B. Anthony explored the field at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or blacks - could have the right to vote.
“They decided to put the cards on the right to vote for women and the right for blacks to focus later,” Hattery said.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why colored women don't believe in white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We've never helped the blacks protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years before they began organizing against lynching in the Association of Southern Women to prevent lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after the blacks first spoke of help.
According to Mitchell, the reaction of white feminists to the questions that happened in Ferguson—the question of police behavior, racial discrimination—reflects the time when white feminists had to “reach out” the questions that blacks had to contend with for generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if activists in these areas [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child just as seriously as they took the right to contraception?”
The second wave of feminists who have made a career of fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now figuring out what it means.
Major feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot by a Facebook attack, where they published a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian, which demanded that white Americans protest more vigorously against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society - and opinions on race, which differ markedly in public opinion polls - will strive for change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem’s remains inter-sectional feminism, which includes questions of race and gender, her comments on the question of race in America are haunting some people.
Christina Sommers, an expert at the American Enterprise Institute, author of Who Stole Feminism?, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are “much more vulnerable than their sisters,” but the remarks from Stone’s side of Ferguson’s face are slanted.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program called My Brother's Keeper, which was meant to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it caused many feminists, including Gloria Steine's angry reaction.
The police’s relationship with the black community is not the only problem that comes to the fore of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the southwest of the country this year, the issue of immigration law reform once again arose – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercadov<0xC3><0xA1>, co-chairwoman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration law reform, said that to be able to raise the issue as necessary for women, the only thing she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"He speaks for himself," says Mercadov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Since most work permits are granted to men, the women who come with them find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
“These stories have been reported in women’s organizations,” she said.
Pigs for sale in Ipswich
The real estate office removed the image of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, it rested in a pig house.
A one-bedroom detached house for sale for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000 stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The informational photos included a picture of the living room, in which he rests with his head on the sofa of the pig.
Connells said the pig in the photo was the pet of the owners.
"The photo felt wrong there, and that's why it's already been removed," a spokesman for the office said.
In the property information, Connells’ real estate office described the former prayer hall as “a single, single-roomed house.”
Although the photo office has already removed it from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the southwest.
Harvey's lottery player gets a million.
The search for a new millionaire in southeastern Perth is underway, with one lucky man taking home $1.1 million from Saturday’s home draw.
Harvey's traffic was the second time in five years that he had been lucky enough to split, the last time he won a million dollars in November 2009.
But the honorable winner has yet to sign in.
The owner of the store, Steve Forward, said he was talking about winning the entire city in southwest Perth.
This is the main topic and everyone is upset.
We thought a similar win was for the touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia shared one win last month, ending a few happy weeks in a row.
Last weekend, a player at Canning Vale became one of five August millionaires and just a few weeks earlier, a couple in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning pair have been betting for twenty years and said that winning will allow them to process the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th single lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning a total of $85 million.
Deutsche Bahn trains will not depart at night.
Drivers want a higher salary.
In a press release, the GDL called the protest a warning strike, for which it agreed to choose time outside of the transport peak.
The GDL takes into account the timing of the strike for many people who return by rail from the weekend until the first working day.
At the same time, we are also thinking about people coming to work during the day," the union said in a press release Monday morning to announce the strike.
"Our first strike should primarily affect freight transport, less already passenger," the GDL added.
So far, DB has not released an official response to the strike announcement.
It is not even clear how the protest action will affect international rail links, including with the Czech Republic.
The professions require an increase in the salaries of the drivers by five percent and a reduction in working hours by two hours per week.
At present, the average salary of motorists is between 36,000 and 46,000 euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) per year, depending on the years worked out.
Drivers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuse to approach wage growth in a reduction in working time.
They stress, however, that the salary assessment of the drivers must be developed in the same way as for the other railway staff, at which DB is not calculated by shortening the working week.
There was a danger that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why the Barum rally is over.
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was completely new, so I didn’t even think that such a thing could happen.
Couldn't the exhaust be temporarily repaired and continued at a slower pace into the service, where the mechanics would replace it?
If we were to go straight there, yes.
But we were still waiting for two more eras, and it didn't work.
There is a high temperature in it and the risk that the car would start burning was great.
I can't afford that.
At full speed, you've passed five speed tests.
How did you feel about them?
Very good.
I felt like a young man.
We were fast, and I didn't go over the wind.
Everything was caused by the fact that the car we drove for more than half a year to be on some level.
The race showed that we were able to do it.
You designed it in such a way that you could really think about winning.
I made myself and the car so that we really had a win.
The job didn't come through.
On the other hand, the result we could have thought of did not come to fruition.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one of the top guys who stepped down early from the championship fight.
He was also a favorite of Breen, Abring and Lappi.
Are you surprised that so many of your favorites have left?
Yeah.
It was a pity, especially for the spectators, because the race ended prematurely.
Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r Tarabus, who you are about to drive, has been at the tip for a long time.
But he paid to fly out of the track and picked up an almost two-minute shortfall.
How were you satisfied with his performance?
It's a shame because he could repeat the degrees of the winners.
He was driving the first two times.
But Mira also confirmed that the car was well-maintained.
He was driving very fast.
Just a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you showed up at the start of the Barum rally.
Can a good feeling of driving make you a regular participant in the rally races again?
Certainly not at this time.
Last year I said that Barumka is my last race and I didn't keep it.
I decided to eat it again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance in a year, I'll probably go into it.
But I'm not thinking about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
To a certain extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking me if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's waiting for you after Barumce?
The team goes on.
Next week we will go to Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't do much damage here.
In addition, he wants to borrow from us the Fabia Honza S<0xC3><0xBD>kora for this race.
With Miro we are waiting for the European doubles race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We're going to have to get things done next year.
Can you suggest anything yet?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsican Rally was part of the World Championship, you reached the fifth place in the series.
Doesn't it make you want to try your tracks again?
Nelkaka.
An oral agreement with an employer may be a problem
Regrettably, you have not been exposed to a doctor’s certificate of incapacity for work, which serves as proof for the organization that you can’t perform work duties for health reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately notify the employer of your absence.
After all, it was agreed that the given days would be recorded as holidays, but the agreement only took place orally.
Although the Labour Code does not oblige the employer to confirm in writing the employer’s consent to the drawing of the leave, in practice this procedure has been proved.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have a confirmation agreement.
Later, the stated consent to the withdrawal of the leave, as well as in your case, rejection and absence at work can be considered as a long-term unforgivable absence, therefore the reason for the immediate cancellation of the employment relationship pursuant to <0xC2><0xA7> 53 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
In the case of a legal dispute about the contract, the employer thus lacks demonstrable evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been cancelled pursuant to <0xC2><0xA7> 53, only you have the dates specified in the balance sheet as an unforgivable absence.
Unforgivable absence in the financial statements does not have the same consequences as <0xC2><0xA7> 53 (e.g. the inability to obtain material security in unemployment), yet this makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and let yourself be confirmed in writing that there has actually been an accident, as a result of which you have been unable to work (it is not a so-called "incompetence", it is only a doctor's certificate).
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.

Tony Stewart's accident on return to track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just a half way behind the Atlanta Motor Speedway racetrack.
Stewart came into play for the second time after his right front tire broke in the 172nd round, and the race for him ended.
Stewart brought the wrecked car into the garage, didn't tell reporters and left.
His team boss Chad Johnston said the 14th car team is disappointed, but will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
“I’d like to have a better performance and a better conclusion,” Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond, and we're hoping we can do more.
Stewart came into play for the first time in a Sunday night race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required the right side of his car to be repaired.
“We put hope in today’s race for a good finish,” Johnston said, adding, “It just didn’t work out.”
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to get a place in the table.
He returned to racing during an investigation into a tragic accident in which twenty-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who took Stewart on the road during the race, died.
Authorities said the investigation into the cause of the accident will last at least another two weeks.
So far, it has not been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion was warmly encouraged before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the beginning of the race he finished in 10th and then even in 4th place.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, Busch's car no.
18 got out of control, got out of the second lap and hit Stewart, sending both cars into the play.
Stewart went on, but retired to 21st place.
Prague has chosen a new taxi station manager, will earn 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedure for the new manager of the taxi service.
For 103 parking lots, it will receive approximately 12.3 million crowns per year.
In recent years, 150 thousand crowns have been collected annually for the same places for taxi drivers.
This was reported by Councillor Lukas Manhart (TOP 09).
Previously, the city used lotteries when selecting administrators.
The winner then received a rent for a lump sum of 1000 kroner per year.
But the rules have changed.
He is currently deciding on the amount of the offer.
"The year since the cancellation of the original leases and the start of the selection procedures has proved that the new rental system is far more advantageous and generally fairer for Prague," says the council.
The most expensive spot is on Per<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n
The highest price was offered by the interested parties for a location in Na Per<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n street.
He will pay 2.1 million kroner a year.
Approximately 1.5 million kroons were paid by new administrators for seats in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new rules of rental of taxi services were adopted in the autumn of 2012 and in the summer of last year they announced the original leases.
The selection process was carried out in four waves and the new manager found 29 positions.
For the second time this year we had to clean the well.
We released it every time, creating practically a second pond around the cottage.
Then we raided Sava.
Unbelievable shot!
Our well in the cellar has always provided plenty of wonderful scented water.
And it wasn't professionally done, my grandfather was handing it out.
It's been a long time.
It was just like three rounds and totally weird, like everything else in the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until next year.
When we started the season, of course, we ran out of water.
When she stood there for a number of months, she deserved it.
But even then, it seemed to us that the water didn’t smell.
We were wondering if something had happened.
In the place where the pump was passing, it was possible with a bit of dirt, there the plate was not quite leaking, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspectors confirmed that the brick was moving.
There was nothing else in the water, and we lit it up to the bottom.
So we let her out again and cleaned her up.
Of course, we improved the improvised seals around the pump pipe.
In the basement, we noticed strange things.
On the ground lay an elegant package with some bones.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little more.
Now it looked like a stray mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where there are leaks, the invention of grandfathers, there were remnants of fish!
It's hard to drive!
Our shop is also quirky.
Someone would say that my grandfather was short-circuiting the chat.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are only sand, only the ceiling is submerged.
There are mainly ships there.
And the car.
And a deckchair on the beach.
The door with wide gaps was usually open as someone walked there in one piece.
At the ceiling of several of the above-mentioned passages.
Without a net, so the birds usually land there and build a nest on the trams.
It is unnecessary to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to fight, and that's it again.
But even the air didn’t help.
The whole store smelled.
So we cleaned up the whole shop.
Especially the fish on the grass was nutritious!
We also threw away things that were around: boards, heraclitus boards, and so on.
Our remote cabin welcomed the next-of-kin disinfectant.
We've been wondering, who could have swallowed the disgusting remains there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
It would be hard for her to go to dinner with us.
My grandfather was attacked by a neighbor who was not well.
What if he didn't sniff at us the crap out there?
He's been here practically all year, stupid ideas, that's what he has.
We decided to watch the cellar and the well and check regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far only for washing and washing before the finished tests, but it was already good.
Pulling water out of a forest shed is not something I'd like to do for a long time.
One day we heard a terrible scary crackling of our fenugreek.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw in the grass beside the veranda a long strong black hadith.
The fox jumped over her and peeped like a madman.
Her mother hired her because she thought Reza was digging a garbage can out of the sink.
But all of a sudden, the hose partially slipped into the club and partially straightened.
There was a snorkeling on the balcony.
Reza got a hysterical seizure.
We ran down.
The owl, long over a metre and fat as a bull, was about to swallow a huge towel, and Réza defended it.
It was not clear if she wanted to save the oil or if she wanted to eat it alone, but it was irrelevant.
When the curtain saw the force in the form of our whole family, she probably said to herself, "Let's eat it when we're that level, and stretch elegantly through the air into the cellar."
We flew after her.
It's like a flash of lightning for a well.
Just by the way, we recorded another fragrant package on her plate.
It smells like fish.
She wasn't there last night!
Our new security around the pump was a little shady.
And we closed the shop all day.
I wish...
We went out, and there we all went for a walk.
We didn't wait long.
It's a shame about the well.
At first, a flat head appeared with yellow moons on its neck.
Then the entire belt rolled into the well.
She swirled around the pump and began to get inside.
An ex-employee got fired, bought laptops from a company and sold them
After his release, he bought a lost employee from a computer company and then sold them.
The money was spent before the police were arrested.
In a short period of time, the man bought in twelve cases a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"After taking the notebooks, he took them to Olomouc, where he was selling them at the bazaars," said Rostislav Br<0xC3><0xBC>ckner, the top commissioner of the Schumper police.
The reason for the fraud was the employer’s salary for dismissal and also the profit of money.
"In the hearing, he told us that he used the money to pay off the loans," Br<0xC3><0xBC>ckner said.
The police also found out that the fraudster is a pathological player who has been repeatedly treated in psychiatry.
Thus, the money could also end up in winning machines or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money with him," the commissioner said.
The perpetrator, who has already been convicted of theft, is now in danger of being jailed for one to five years.
The police have not yet announced whether the punishment is also threatened by the bazaars, which the laptops bought and sold below the price.
"It's true that they've taken over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious," the commissioner said.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar have been charged so far.
Come on, a little more, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have made a few changes.
The biggest change was the route that brought the target to the nave, instead of leading back to the Yellow Spa.
I was looking forward to the race together with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a little bit from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the stand, where we photographed and filmed videos together.
In order to achieve perfection on the other hand, I accepted the role of personal guide.
Together with my friend K<0xC3><0xA1>t<0xC5><0x91>, we were obediently placed at the end of the corridor 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We said good-bye to the friends who walked around us into the fast runner sector.
There wasn't much time left.
A few steps to warm up, turn on sports tests, countdown and start!
Shouts of jasmine, but instead of a quick start followed the dripping to the start line.
After five minutes, we reach the gate, turn on the measurement and break it down at a rate of ten.
We fly with a yellow snake of runners, who, like K<0xC3><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xA1>, run their first race.
So far, they all look fresh, slowly falling sun in the sky provides a view of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad almost to a pinchy feel.
The pulsating mass stretching along the coast looks like the whole of Prague is running here.
On the coast between Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad and the National Theatre, it traditionally begins to show who has the strength.
A light stroller on Palacké Square forces many runners to slow down or walk.
Just before moving to the Theatre, I see a police escort and immediately behind it V<0xC3><0xAD>tek Pavli<0xC5><0xA1>ta flies at an incredible pace to the destination.
I can hear the strange snoring of other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's going to cry with me, but just before that, my leg is going to rot and our hands are going down.
Running down the Theatre Street gives you a chance to relax and unwind for a short time.
There's a need, there's places in front of us where my views will take my breath away.
The arch on the Manes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the sunset.
I can’t breathe and my feet are almost alone.
The moment of truth comes in the first supper.
When crossing the road, K<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA5>a scurrys about the curb and shows the jump by swimming.
I'm watching if she doesn't need help, and I'm launching a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It rises and we continue on Koz<0xC3><0xAD> street, it is one of the lowest places on the track, at this stage of the race there is no such navel, yet it is necessary to observe the surroundings well.
I have no idea that the concept of the lowest place will get its true meaning later.
Behind the Pra<0xC5><0xA1>na Gate, tourists and friends of other runners encourage us freneticly.
I'm trying to make a splash with anyone who offers a hand, and I'm also recommending K<0xC3><0xA1>ta, because ten splashes with fans is like half the energy bar.
The fact is, we're speeding up again, and even though we've failed quite a bit, now the race has begun.
We run dozens of runners, when I have someone especially tired, I try to encourage him a few words: "Come on, a little more, you can do it!"
No one cares about us anymore, we're speeding up.
So far we've been running for an hour and a quarter, we add, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the target will hurt, but you really need to get rid of it.
The sun is already slowly setting and the day ends symbolically slowly ending the race.
The last exit to the bridge, the turn and just a straight line to the finish.
The pace we're running at, I wonder where the girl's at?
"Come on, let's go in at 3:00, let's do it!" I cried.
We're trying it, we're sprinting, and here's the goal.
Thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
The coach set a limit of 20 hours.
So seven minutes under the plan.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the target, the Cat's legs are folded, helping her to relax for a while.
It is on her to see exhaustion, but also happiness from a well-executed performance.
After a while, I slowly take her out of the target area.
Euforie doesn't let us think about the pressure in the passageways to the dressing rooms.
Here it can be seen that Koz<0xC3><0xAD> street was not the narrowest place.
Thus, it is only here that the target of the flood, which is under attack of almost ten thousand runners, is trapped to collapse.
If someone doesn't like the crowd, that's not the place for him.
After a while, I also lose my head and wonder if the wonderful views and more interesting route compared to the last years were worth what was going on in the destination.
From my own experience, I know that running a race is no fun.
Adding to this ten thousand people, a rich accompanying programme and the closure of the entire center of Prague for all transport, is a huge challenge.
This year’s change of route showed the runners many interesting places, but it also brought a few really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped in the Yellow Spas was transferred between the runners and in the race itself.
The organizers around the track and the random spectators graded it on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, the city’s historic centre has to face obstacles that cannot be removed, but the goal of the mass race in a place that is bordered on one side by walls and on the other by a river, I do not consider the best solution.
If I say that the race has ended with a goal, I consider it to be very guided.
I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but in the end everything went well.
Write to us in the discussion if you liked the route and what you say about the situation in the destination.
Prison Guards in Bulgaria Organize Protests
Hundreds of prison service employees across Bulgaria attended a nationwide protest rally in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
At the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the restoration of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
The list of demands to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov also includes higher salaries.
The month’s overseers symbolically protested against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the committees of the prison guards and the representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
“The negotiations are still going on,” said Rosen Zhelyazkov, the head of the Directorate General of Prison Service.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Professional Organizations of Employees in the Ministry of the Interior will also join the protests of employees of the prison service.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we don't see them
Physicists usually don't write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University managed to hit a black box in 1999.
His book Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laity to get into the hustle and bustle of problems that a number of theoretical physicists deal with today - an attempt to unify two excellently functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum relativity and current theory.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that in the case of the search for a unified physical theory, it is not a boring story.
The physical fundamental problem between the two key theories (for at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) has been solved and so it is so imaginative that it is worth re-evaluating even the laity.
In addition, Greene advised himself with complex material so freshly and convincingly that he could not count how much interesting he did not include in his book.
In addition, he corrected his "mistake" for the most part in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object to his book getting old faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years there will only be something more alive in this area (perhaps because the LHC accelerator will finally go to "full gas"), so it is a good time to enter Green's nonviolently opened door to the modern physics world.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound silly, fantastical, strange, or mystical.
Yet it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let’s turn our eyes from the universe as a whole to something more subterranean, specifically to a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine pulling the stomateur garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the whole scenario from a half-kilometer distance (as in the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you can easily record a long stretched hose in the horizontal direction, but if you do not suffer from the sharpness, the thickness of the hose is hardly noticeable.
Given its great distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on a hose has only one dimension in which it can be traversed: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ants were at the time, you will answer them with only one answer: the distance of the ants from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from a half-kilometer distance, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has a thickness.
If we enlarge everything, we will suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle of a hanging hare.
In such an enlarged view, it is obvious that the ants can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "size in/against the direction of the movement of the clock handles", i.e., in the circle of the hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small ants, you need to enter two numbers: how far from the end of the hose and where there is a hanging hose on the circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note: experts will notice that this chapter focuses purely on the faulty theory of strungs.
The non-recovery aspects are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.)
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a direct arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked by a circular arrow, is short and curved.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The length of the hose is long and easily visible.
The size of the coiling circumference of the hose is short, "turned" and less noticeable.
In order to realize the existence of the circular dimension, we had to examine the hadith with a significantly better resolution.
The above example illustrates an important property of spatial dimensions.
The fact that they are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, large, and therefore directly visible, or, conversely, small, curved and much worse observable.
Of course, in this case, we didn't just pretend to reveal the "sliding" dimension surrounding the thickness of the hose.
It was enough to take the help of a telescope.
But if the hose were thinner - like hair or capillary - we would only reveal the curved dimension with great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent Einstein an article in which he elaborated with the astonishing idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three known dimensions for all of us.
Kaluza's radical claim was justified by the fact that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be dragged into a single, unified conceptual structure.
The question immediately arises as to how this view of Kaluz goes along with the obvious fact that we are seeing three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein made clear and clarified in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and curved dimensions.
This means that, just like the dimension in the length of the hose, our universe also has a large, large and easily visible three dimensions, whose existence we realize at every moment.
But analogously to the circular circumference of the garden hose, the universe can have an additional dimension, firmly bent into a space so shallow that it has remained hidden even from our most perfect experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of the nature of Kaluz’s remarkable proposal, let’s stay for a while at the hose.
Imagine drawing a fairly dense series of circles on the circumference of the hose.
At a distance, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope now, thanks to the drawing, we will reveal the curved dimension even more tired, because we will see the motif in Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, so together it has four spatial dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
In order to help our imaginations a little, let us note the illustrations on Fig.3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture we enlarge the view of the geometry of the space similar to how we enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of magnification) if they are rolled into a small enough space; thus we explain that we have not yet directly observed them.
The square grid represents the commonly known "big" dimension, while the circle is a new, tiny, and curved dimension.
Just like the loops of threads in the densely woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of ordinary dimensions - only for the sake of the attention we have drawn them only into the diameters in the square mesh.
The background of Figure 4 depicts the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - on such common scales as meters, shown by the side of a small square in a square grid.
In each of the following images, we will focus on a small area of the previous image; we will enlarge it to become visible.
At first, there is nothing special happening, as we see in the first few levels of enlargement.
However, if we proceed on our way behind the microscopic properties of the geometry of space further - on the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we will suddenly see a new, curved dimension in the shape of a circle, similar to the loops or in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of large dimensions similar to that of a hose having a circular circumference at every point in its length.
In the interest of attention, we have rounded up only in some, regularly-displaced points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluz and Klein’s idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also notice important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-spreading spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), while the hose has a large size of only one.
An even more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object within the universe, such as our hadith.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularly curved dimension is extremely miniature, it is much more difficult to recognize it - as well as the circular circumference of the hose - than to observe obvious, large and large dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will in fact be revealed even above the strength of our most modern magnification tools.
The most important thing, however, is that the additional dimension is not just a rounded bush within the ordinary dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration erroneously indicates.
A circle dimension is a new dimension, which exists in each point of three common diffraction dimensions.
It is the dimension on the remaining three dimensions independent as well as the dimensions of the top-down, left-right and front-back-independent (and triangular) each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions, and in determining its position we would need four data, except for the three usual still positions in the circular dimension; if we count even the time, then the data five, in each case more than one, the norm.
Did you get excited?
You can buy Brian Greeena's Elegant Universe here at books.idnes.cz.
The price for an e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, therefore, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluzova and Klein's reasoning shows that this does not exclude the existence of additional curved dimensions, if they are small enough.
The universe can have more dimensions than how many of them we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The state-of-the-art technical equipment can recognize the structures of a large one hundred billionth of a meter.
We can hardly see the smaller curved dimensions.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluz's original idea with several ideas from the newly born quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that the additional circular dimension could be about the size of one Planck's length, i.e. the size far behind the distinguishing capabilities of today's devices.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions the Kaluz–Klein theory.
Housing Honza Homola advises how to practice on an electric guitar: 5th part
The whole essence of the "twelve" consists in a twelve-stroke harmonic form, which you can repeat at will.
Anyone who taps into music theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By educating the puppeteer and puppeteer, whose Facebook profile can be watched here, he has been living as a graphic artist since he was a teenager twenty years ago.
He's a guitarist for the band Wohnout, which unfortunately he can't leave.
Kytarist is after his father, as is brother Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j, leader of the Wohnout.
Start with the training on one line.
“The rhythmic model is just for you, you can invent anything, then just apply it to the harmonic model of the twelve,” Honza advises.
When you add another string, you can change the figure again.
All you have to do is listen and watch Honz, what you can do with the 12-string harmony on two strings and how well it starts to sound.
When you add a third string, you can already flirt with the melody of some songs.
When you finally add a fourth, pay attention to the change of tuning, notes Honza in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to the pentatonic and you will try to put her together with the twelve.
So practice it honestly.
Best of all, you can read this in an interview with Jan Homolo at his first lesson of his school playing electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for the big celebration, admits the castle Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k
We take the point and we like it.
The first half we had more chances, the second home," said the assailant, who scored from the penalty kick this time.
You weren't nervous when he played it, were you, just accompanied by a huge whistle?
Somehow I didn’t notice it, although at the second gate, where there are domestic fans, it would probably be worse.
You've dealt the penalty after half an hour, but you've also got the goal out of the penalty after less than four minutes.
What's the matter?
We fell asleep at the beginning, we were passive, arose from the corner, and then the penultimate.
After that you got up and in the first half you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
Hard to say.
I agree with the fact that we played well after the incautious goal until the break.
In the cabin, we thought we wanted to keep pace with the game, but we couldn’t.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it’s also probably true that the housewives said something to their game about the break, maybe they weren’t too pleased with it.
You have only scored on the opponent's field for the first time, while at home you may not have even got a goal yet.
Why is there such a difference?
I wouldn't say that's the difference, but it's up to us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Pilsen, that's another category.
You've been waiting four games for the goal, weren't you afraid that it might be similar after the last match?
Maybe not, but of course we are glad that we don’t have to talk about waiting for the goal from the last match.
Now we have added another one without waiting, but there are still only three in six matches, which is not yet a big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from a kilometer away crater.
Lava flying on the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnaj<0xC3><0xB6>kull glacier, flows through an underground tunnel from the kilometer away crater.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact now worries scientists the most about...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still flies out of the crack about the same amount of lava.
Contrary to the original estimates, however, its amount is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
In contrast to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x bigger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could open even in places where it is located under the ice.
If this were to happen, with the same intensity as the current eruptions, it would mean huge floods, both on the J<0xC3><0xB6>kuls<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC3><0xA1> Fj<0xC3><0xB6>llum River and on other rivers.
In the vicinity of the eruption there is a strong smell of sulfur, clouds of steam and gas rise from the crack.
It is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the eruption at Fimmv<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>uh<0xC3><0xA1>ls in 2010.
This is much larger and there is also a lot more gas there," says volcanologist <0xC3><0x81>rmann H<0xC3><0xB6>skuldsson.
However, the weather has improved significantly since yesterday, in the early hours there was almost no wind in the area.
Footsteps after a sandstorm were muddled by rain.
Scientists can continue to do their job.
For air traffic, the orange (second highest) level applies to B<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB0>arbunga and the yellow (third) to Askju.

Flight day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 was introduced the aircraft acrobat Peggy Valentinov<0xC3><0xA1>, which flew from the cockpit to the castle on the upper wing of the biplane and also between the wings.
There it is only attributed to the strength of the muscles.
Flight day in Cheb was already underway this year and the organisers managed to prepare a few interesting flight pieces again.
The premiere took place at the oldest Czech airport not only "walking on the wings" in the submission of the German acrobat Peggy Valentinov<0xC3><0xA1>, but also the legendary fighter P-51 D Mustang or aircraft Beechcraft 18.
He drew attention to himself with his radiant sweat.
The acrobat called Wingwalking originated in the United States.
After World War I, many former war pilots tried to fly.
However, due to the large number of fatalities, it was banned.
Today, however, he is slowly returning to the aviation program.
Peggy leaves the cockpit on the top wing after the start.
There he performs a variety of exercises.
At the end of the performance, she moves to the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues," said Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from the Czech Ultralight Club and the organizer of the flight day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main staple of the program, then the next performance of the Mustang was a famous cherry on the cake.
The legendary fighter landed on the surface with the Grippens of the Army of the Czech Republic hanging (also called in numbers).
This is the first time that aviation fans in the Czech Republic have seen such a composition.
The pilot Miroslav S<0xC3><0xA1>zavsk<0xC3><0xBD> then showed everyone the breathing acrobatics with a 1945 aircraft.
He was made during the war, but probably never participated in it.
He was included in the military reserves.
Since 1963 he has been active in the civil sphere.
As well as a racing plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>ta.
At the same place is also another pearl of the Cheb air day, the two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
At the airport, a huge machine didn't go over.
His polished aluminum roof lit up in the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colours of the French Air Force was also awarded accolade.
A small transport aircraft jumped behind the abandoned Turbolet and brought part of the German delegation from the German Hof to the air day.
German neighbors showed up in Cheb with reconstructed aircraft such as the 18T or the three-member formation of the B<0xC3><0xBC>cker Jungmann biplanes.
Lucie Borhyov<0xC3><0xA1>: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
Parental care has been replaced by Lucie Borhy for at least tonight's work.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde moderator obviously doesn't know anything about it.
The moderated TV news was good for her, as if she hadn’t stopped with him for two months at all!
It’s only two weeks since the blondes ended on the sixth Sunday, during which women experience the greatest stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not appear regularly in the main news report of TV Nova.
According to the information Blesk.cz waits for her regular return for up to a month.
After all, only her daughter Linda needs her now more than television viewers.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a hit in black.
Exhibitions for the year in Prague?
Hala would sell out, plans to divorce J<0xC3><0xA1>gr
It would be a good idea to do something like this during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the alliance is built,” he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called the Golden Match, in which a stunning Nagan team met again.
And the players who participated in the golden hattrick.
The players would have a taste, wouldn't they?
I'm sure.
In short, it would be good to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
In my opinion, you can find one or two days during the tournament, when it is completely free and where such a match could be mixed.
Let's say it to Gum (Jiri <0xC5><0xA0>légr) or Bed<0xC5><0xAF> <0xC5><0xA0><0xC4><0x8D>erban (the organizer of the Jihlava match) who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play with New Jersey play-offs?
So when I get there...
You don’t want to play in the team.
Or did the Jihlava meeting change your decision somehow?
The representation and the exhibition matches are two different things and in the representation there are decisive performances.
One thing is, people would like to see me there, but the performances are decisive, especially at the World Cup.
There should be players who have it there, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed at all.
How did you actually enjoy the Nagan meeting?
It was a great meeting with the players.
Man revived his stories and experienced a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for us hockey players.
The most important thing, however, was the honor of Ivan Hlinka.
And it’s good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that one generation is leaving, which really was worth it.
Slavom<0xC3><0xAD>r Lener, Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r R<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ka and Petr <0xC4><0x8C>echm<0xC3><0xA1>nek on the switch.
Will you still be able to play your first team match?
He doesn't forget things like that.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three young people: me, Robert Hol<0xC3><0xAD>k and Robert Reichel, we entered in one trio.
It was the first start for everyone.
Well, if we were to dominate in some way, it can't be said.
In Jihlava, Dominik Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek was captured for a long time.
What did you say to his performance?
Hashan will never surprise me on the ice.
I wanted to return it to him with that criticism, but I can't (Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek criticized J<0xC3><0xA1>gra for why he decided to finish in the national team).
Hnili<0xC4><0x8D>ka also performed well.
He was training with me once a night, and there was a hole.
And now he's getting famous.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, the qualification for the footballers begins
Prominent guests were visiting the Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chovsk<0xC3><0xBD> NH Hotel on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, goalkeeper Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech from Chelsea, representative coach Pavel Vrbu...
And there, that character in the black khiltovka, that's Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosick<0xC3><0xBD>!
The Arsenal defender and the captain of the team reached a meeting of about half a dozen of the latter.
We are looking forward to a beautiful match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn’t be happy?” he said as he appeared before the press in the representative’s office.
Programme of the Czech national team
Monday, September 1st: the start of the match, the first training
Tuesday 2 September: Training open for fans (18:30, Summer) Autogramiada (20:00)
Wednesday 3rd September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday, September 9 Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of match
Russian and spol. can support fans even before Wednesday’s game against the US (20:15).
For them, the team opened a Tuesday training session, which starts at 18:30.
And it will be followed by an autograph, which neither Russia nor the Czech Republic will miss.
Otherwise, however, this meeting of the national team will be more peaceful.
This is a tribute to coach Vrba, who has been complaining about a lot of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now we will focus on the Netherlands.
There is an advantage when you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to train things that haven’t been there for so long,” said Vrba, who has been officially leading the national team since January.
When entering the new qualifying cycle, the Czech national football team will be accompanied by a musketeer image.
Under Vrbo, the team has three games behind them, all ready.
Norway and Finland lost 2–2 and Austria lost 1–2.
However, these results were not yet important.
That's it now.
The match with the Netherlands will kick off the qualifying round for the 2016 European Championship.
It would, of course, help the Czech men if they could also manage the general against the United States.
The first half was to get to know each other.
Now there are important results.
We have to think about being successful," Vrba agreed.
The only player with a twenty-three-member nomination who has health problems is the forward David Lafat.
He's been hit by the temperature.
If he failed to recover to Wednesday's game against the United States, coach Vrba would have called another striker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed.
A woman from Britain describes how she thought she would die after a bad diagnosis for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she only had a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, because very little is known about the disease.
It is estimated that around 23,000 people suffer from CMT in the UK, which can manifest symptoms in the area of motor skills such as muscle weakness, restless walking, and crooked toes.
Insensitivity or pain may also occur in the affected person, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that over time the symptoms worsen.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Friedreich's ataxia (FA) - a disease that has a very poor prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her 18th birthday, she would be hanged on a wheelchair, and she would be dead before she turned 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as everyone else.
I fell down every day and it took me longer.
“I could never ride on skates or skateboards with the other kids, and I was bullied at school because of the way I was walking and running.”
When Rodgers was thirteen, and after several surgeries that were supposed to loosen her Achilles tendons and straighten her legs, she took advantage of the fact that her doctor left the room, and looked into her documentation, where she learned that she was suffering from the FA.
“I felt guilty because I was stalking, and so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home, I searched for information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” she says.
When they told me I was in shock, I panicked.
I thought before I was eighteen, I'd end up in a wheelchair, and before I was twenty-five, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd gradually lose all my skills.
I was on my own and planned a funeral.”
When she was seventeen, she realized that her walking ability had not deteriorated as much as she had expected, and she asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up and hugged her and said, "Sweetheart, I don't think you're sick here, otherwise you'd be in the cart already.
I think it’s going to be a lot less life-threatening.”
After taking several genetic tests, it was found to have CMT.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a lucky kid,” she said.
The charity CMT UK has launched a month of CMT awareness to warn about the disease.
Entrepreneurs in the Washington area: with the reversal of the economy, taxes are rising
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes, too.
According to a new survey published last week, the state and local taxes on companies in the country accelerating the recovery of the economy last year have risen slightly and companies in Washington have been no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia combined spent $27.6 billion in state and local taxes for fiscal year 2013, which is 3.8% higher than the $26.6 billion selected in 2012.
Last year's tax burden - state and local - rose by 4.3% to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year, and was the third consecutive year since 2009 and 2010, when taxes fell.
According to a study conducted by Ernst & Young, a professional firm and the political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes rose faster by 4.3% than local deductibles by 3.9%.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56%, is from property taxes, and 36% of Maryland's income is from corporations.
Virginia, with 28%, shows the least tax revenue from the business.
The researchers claim that the majority share of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of real estate owned by companies, which has increased property taxes this year after three consecutive years with a growth of -1%.
Although most of the profits come from major states such as California, New York and Texas, the same situation seems to be in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland and Virginia paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, a year-on-year increase of 4.2% compared to $9.6 billion in 2012.
The apparent increase in the value of real estate, however, does not amount to a rise in state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the property tax represents less than a fifth of the company’s taxes.
For businesses in Virginia and D.C., real estate tax accounts for almost half of the state and local taxes.
“Maryland owns a lot of real estate companies, especially the tax base around D.C., a government or non-profit organization that doesn’t pay taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
A recent increase in tax revenues from businesses cannot be attributed only to the recovering real estate market.
According to the data, business revenue appears to be increasing as well.
Companies in the region have posted a $2.3 billion corporate income tax, which has risen from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland chose $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the region’s highest in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden of entrepreneurs does not grow in these three places as quickly.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average of 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher at 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, the tax increase was below the average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax of all three counties (all of which have the same taxes) of 6%.
The rate of taxation of commercial companies in Maryland is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and a generally more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
The D.C. study did not evaluate.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state continues to meet the revenue targets in the coming year, the statutory rate of income tax could be reduced by up to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study with small business owners in Washington, Washington, it leads better and therefore pays higher state and local taxes.
The pet tax levied by small businesses as a personal income tax - the structure of compensation for increasing costs by price increases, according to which the majority of companies are organized - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia grew by 20% last year to $2.4 billion, much more so than last year.
The researchers claim that the trend and nationwide increase in the income tax is likely to continue next year, with total tax revenue from sales to state and local governments being compared to the same period in the previous three quarters of 20142 on the top 6 percent of the year.
However, Washington may lag behind others, as reducing government spending picks up its tax on the labor market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin’s Novorussia and Lafayette’s scissors
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin called for talks on Novorossiysk
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government units have been clashing with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions they will have a difficult return to the Russian market.
According to him, the support provided by the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine is against democratic values.
The end of the conflict, he said, depends on Kiev, so he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
Any other sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic has the right to disagree with the parties
The European Commission, together with the diplomats, is due to propose a form of further strengthening of anti-Russian sanctions in a week, the EU summit decided on tonight.
This was told by the permanent chairman of the meeting of the Member States Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals to shift the form of sanctions should be prepared as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuye to be replaced in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the European Council at the European Union summit, the so-called EU President, who heads the summit of member states.
He will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years from December.
As head of European diplomacy, Catherine Ashton is replaced by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
Italy, which will become the Vice-President of the future European Commission, has yet to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, but it is not talked about
Helping an incurable and long-term patient with a life-threatening illness?
In Czech conditions, where the laws do not allow euthanasia, this is not legally possible.
However, the statements of the doctors who spoke to LN indicate that they are hearing about such requests.
ALS: The hardest chapter in neurology, says doctor about sclerosis
The Czech Republic suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) of approximately three hundred people, 21 patients undergo experimental stem cell treatment in Prague's Motole.
We don’t know 100% if it will be successful.
But if we don't try it, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, a motor neuroscientist.
It's about knowing the CIA manuscript, they needed a war, Huml writes about shooting down MH17
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD MP Stanislav Huml has made it clear who shot down a Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "the heavy sanctions, which were imposed in view of the shooting down of a civilian aircraft with almost 300 dead, were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army."
In addition, according to the lawmaker, the CIA manuscript is known.
Unfulfilled promises.
Elections are approaching and the parties are again offering the impossible
End of homeless on the streets, parking for each family and a cable car over Prague.
This is repeated before every election: the parties promise the impossible.
Even now, with the upcoming municipal elections, politicians are ahead of who likes the voters the most.
The server Lidovky.cz has chosen unfulfilled promises from the present and past.
Seventy years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed in Dunkerque.
A horrible siege has begun.
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak independent brigade moved to France.
Its commander Alois Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka has consistently requested the addition of technical equipment and the dispatch to the front.
The British party eventually complied and classified this ground unit as one of its forces at the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of the German troops.
SOUHRN: Plze<0xC5><0x88> leads the league ahead of Prague's "S", Liberec declassified Ban<0xC3><0xAD>k
Viktoria Plze<0xC5><0x88> is the new leader of the football league, who leads the point in front of both Prague "S".
The changes in the table led to Slavia's 1:2 defeat in Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav.
After two defeats, Sparta recovered in the home league, defeating Jablonec thanks to two Lafat raids.
The record win in the year was attributed to Liberec, who shot Ban<0xC3><0xAD>k Ostrava 6:0.
62,000 spectators on volleyball?
The Poles say yes
The introduction of the MS volleyball players in Warsaw brought a spectacular record.
At the football stadium under the covered roof, 62,000 spectators watched a smooth victory over the Serbs.
Tickets were sold out in 100 minutes.
How to survive a return from vacation?
Don't rush anywhere and get some sleep
The last days of vacation are ahead of us.
Getting used to it after returning from a sunny beach or cottage at a normal working pace can be for many nuts.
It can even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are proven tips on how to cope with a changed situation: to hurry up and get a good night’s sleep.
Joan Rivers Family: “We hold our fingers”
Joan Rivers is unconscious for three days, from the moment she was taken to the hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today that she is not losing hope that an 80-year-old comedian will recover.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a phone call to the emergency department said she had a heart attack at a Yorkshire endoscopy in the Upper East Side, the source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains “serious”.
Reactions to themselves did not last long, including unreal online support from personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is a cross-title
The fact that the media, with its headlines, are crossing reality, is (unfortunately) no news.
I know that the headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who don't read anything else.
And that's the fact that I've been in a lot of pain lately, the word "stupid" is more of a catchphrase.
This is especially true of articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
It is quite common for the headlines to be "Israel attacked Gaza".
Only in the text will you learn that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the announced truce.
This will be followed by the title "Both sides have violated the ceasefire".
Is the journalistic community aware that by doing so, it is directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing across Europe (and not only there)?
It has not been more than 60 years since the end of World War II.
So far, there are people who have survived the Shoa.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd chanted the slogans "Jewish swine" and the like, I was stunned.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed to do?
Do our journalists realize that after the Jews were destined for the extermination of the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please devote a little more attention to your work.
You're often referred to as "watchdogs of democracy."
So defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided that the Czech nation would be liquidated and the Czech Republic would be wiped off the world map?
Perhaps you should also be aware of one more fact.
In the territory of the State of Israel, almost 20% of Arabs live with Israeli citizenship.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them why they don’t go between “theirs,” like to Gaza, they’ll answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security, and top-notch health care (I have seen for myself how the top private Hadassah hospital, which is funded from sponsorship gifts from Jews from around the world, is usually also attended by Arabs and is, of course, treated there).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with its missiles.
The only real help for Gaza, and thus this troubled region, is to get rid of Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, even if indirectly in the titles.
Inform about the practices of Hamas, about its abuse of people as human shields.
Inform them that Hamas aims to liquidate the state of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Inform us that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Inform us that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area could have flourished thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, which, however, the administrators of Gaza do not pay for and are even upset that at this time the supply of electricity is sometimes interrupted.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that they could penetrate the suicide bombers in Israel, but, perhaps, in the construction of residential homes, hospitals and schools, its Arab brothers from Gaza would have lived much better.
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed Monday morning's statement: The Internet retailer - a video producer and hundreds of other things - is buying Twitch's video streaming service for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement came as a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because it was expected that the buyer would be YouTube.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google looked like one billion secure, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago by Justin.tv, had become a widely used video streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast on it online broadcasts from games - the words Business Insider "YouTube for Live Streamed Play".
Interface Twitch.
YouTube already has popular videos "Let's play", the kind where the wise (mostly older) give the games processing Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube comes to a lot of shock when describing Twitch, so reports that YouTube is buying Twitch, didn’t excite anyone much, it was a textbook example of how the established company will pay off potential competition.
The problem is why the deal with YouTube didn’t come out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we currently have is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Sheara: “We chose Amazon because we believe in our company, have the same values and long-term vision and want to help us meet it faster.”
Another mystery is – frankly – the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who say sport is better than watching, it’s hard to understand what’s so amazing about watching games instead of playing real games.
One thing is to watch a friend across the shoulder at three in the morning as Resident Evil plays, and quite another thing is to watch someone else get 20 hits in the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you might be looking at right now.
Another problem is that a lot of today’s most popular games are from a player’s perspective, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective itself is quite a good recipe for how to get kakalav.
I admit that speed run games, in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic era complete the game in record time, is fun.
But if someone isn’t a master of play or humor, his channel on Twitch probably won’t be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million monthly visits and is the fourth on top of Internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon use it?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch is meddling in Amazon Instant Video just as elegantly as it used to be.
But Twitch has something every company would like to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Twitch Shear said, Amazon and Twitch “believe in the future of games” and the media don’t seem to be getting along, nor as – a hug – viewers.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by American atheist vlogger Arona Ra.
This time on the theme "Holy Scripture is the Word of God."
Added the original video.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by actual human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that are contrary to their religion, they often ask us: Who will you believe in?
The Word of God, or the Word of Man?
It is as if the human inquiry is absolutely nothing compared to the authority which they imagine to have their doctrine.
But when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God," they refer to the myths about God written by people.
If there really is an intelligent creator with some purpose, then it is he who has created a fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who has invented the genetic patterns that corresponded to it, and it must be he who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will give the next series of clues to evolution.
Why else would all of these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn’t create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fable.
And they were the people who wrote all the texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by people, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictation of angels, but these texts were written by none but mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and no longer gods.
If there really was one true God, it would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the super-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the whole cosmos.
If an entity of this size had ever written a book, there would be only one such book, one sacred letter.
It would be known all over the world, without precedents, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors would not be able to measure themselves with such a work.
And people would not have to blindly believe it, because it would be consistent, subject to verifiable and truthful evidence, and would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would constantly inspire every reader to the unity of the common faith.
If God had written it, we would not have expected anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without a common origin, and all of them are constantly falling apart on a more and more separate denomination, looking for the disputed truth, and in some way turning aside from each other, claiming to be indifferent to God.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospel, the Islamic Koran, the Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'u'll<0xC3><0xA1>h's Kit<0xC3><0xA1>b-i-Akd<0xC3><0xA1>s, Zarathustra's Avesta, the Sikh Ad<0xC3><0xAD>-Granch, the Mahabharata's Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Book of Urantia, are all considered
The only logical explanation is probably that all of them are to some extent on the descent.
None of the above-mentioned books has any advantage over the others.
None of them has any evidence against them, and none of them can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I am a professor of ancient history at the University of Western Michigan.
I’m not saying that I’ve proven the Bible to be reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it isn't.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apologies (defenses) because they contain incompatibility, absurdity, and primitive notions once considered to be true, which have already been overcome.
So you can't claim to be proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them are proselytizing disgusting superstitions instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy - with the fact that everyone can also contain prophecy that was not fulfilled.
The leading theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion have been written by human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often bound politically-motivated authors, which they explain in many of the verses of the Bible and do not contradict.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, rather a mutual comment.
We need to point out again that here we have two different authors whose work has somehow been mixed together during some editorial review.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is definitely not a story of an obvious witness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e. five Books of Moses and Moses do not attribute authorship to any of them, because it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezdr<0xC3><0xA1>s) of several mutually unrelated oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
Other documents were refiled at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believer thinks.
The Scrolls from the Dead Sea are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, and yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druidism, and Cults.
Christianity began as a Gnostic religion, followed by the Doctrines and Ebionites and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually merged into a compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups such as the Luciferians were disfellowshipped and discredited by further Bible revisions.
One of these modifications relates to King Ugarit, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a fundamental threat to the young Moslem religion, the authors of the New Law decided to laugh, and Ba'al Zebula, "Lord of the Mountains" changed to Belzebub "Lord of the Many".
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what became the New Law was canonized in the 4th century A.D. in a series of commission decisions at the House of Lords in Nice.
The four Gospels were accepted, and the sixteen others were rejected by simply raising their hands, as if the reality of some thing were allowed to be accepted or rejected by voting.
The manner in which the canon developed depended on what was being read about Sundays in the then Christian centers.
What happened on the second Sunday after Easter in the Church of Jerusalem?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually they found out that they were getting close to the same evangelical stories.
And so the core of the canon evolved from the desire of the original church.
So the council simply accepted as the gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at that time.
But they also knowingly removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they referred to them as approved books.
Among the rejected items are the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should the Word of God refer us to books that are only the words of some people and/or are no longer even available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God were the real author of this random mixture of fame, likeness, and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by people and certainly not too enlightened, rather, on the contrary!
That’s why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, whether it’s almost anything from start to finish.
We’re talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys can speak, believed in superstitions, bloody sacrifices, ritual magic, magical objects, fiery lecterns, astrology, and five animates of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic wand that someone was spraying with blood, it would cure him of leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were cockroaches, and bats were birds, and whales were fish, and pee was the whole number.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cow striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could anyone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the errors it contains.
If it came from a feather of a truly superior being and was conceived as a literal story, then it would contain nothing of what it contains at all.
As a moral guide totally fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings have been written in oriental and bigoted savages who have overlooked or supported cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, abuse of slaves, exploitation, exploitation
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God’s will.
But the creationists still ignore all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the truth must be ignored!
And why?
Because if the creationists didn’t have their favorite books, they wouldn’t have a god either.
In their world, one and the other are the same.
It is ironic that they reject God’s “work” as “creating instead of the Creator.”
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and God himself, and even insist that the repudiation of their supposedly "holy" books somehow repels God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians believe that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and the Bible could be mistaken at the same time because it cannot separate the doctrine from the deity.
So it’s a kind of prayer where believers worship man-made compilations, as if these books were God Himself, because they think they are His word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the scriptures of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected in their supposedly "invariable word" of any god has been invented, assembled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often deliberately altered and crossed by mere human error.

Participant of the bee challenge knocked out her jaw
As she leaned over the head of the ice water, Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom screamed, damaging her facial bone structure.
This bee challenge didn't work.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed at the bee's call, dislocating her jaw.
While she was licking ice water on her head, Isabelle Roberts screamed so loudly that she damaged the structure of the bones in her face.
“The water was so cold that I had to scream, but at the same time my jaw started to swell,” she told The Mirror.
A 20-year-old girl poured water on herself.
Isabelle Roberts's moments before the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but it didn't work, it was stuck, and I realized something was going on.
Then it happened to my mother and sister, they might have laughed, but I had to hurry up."
A 20-year-old girl had to be hospitalized to get her jaw back to its original location after she took part in a fashion viral wave on Tuesday.
The video became an internet sensation, and thousands of people shared it on Facebook and Twitter.
Chinese school gunman stabbed nine people, three of them dead
A man named Chen, according to the New China News Agency, broke into the elementary school building in the morning and attacked around half an eleventh of the local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in the hospital.
Chechnya was later killed by a jump from a height, New China said with reference to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
Therefore, the public is calling for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where many married couples have only one descendant in line with government policy.
Zeman showed the first boys in L<0xC3><0xA1>nek how he had to sit in school
The smallest schoolgirls took the nine boys to their class, where they and the teacher were waiting for the president's arrival.
He then showed the children how he had to sit alone in school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, it's fortunately not waiting for you anymore, you're free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then handed it over to the first-born as a gift to the heads.

The Minister of Education Marcel Chl<0xC3><0xA1>dek started the new school year in a private sports school in Lithuania.
"This year I want to connect Czech education more with Czech sport," said one of the reasons why the first school day was held in the north of the Czech Republic.
The head of the school spoke to him a while ago at a hockey match in Litvinov.
"They were the first, so I accepted an invitation to participate in the start of the school year," the minister added.
The Minister of Education Marcel Chl<0xC3><0xA1>dek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) started the school year in a private sports school in Lithuania.
This year, there were 115,000 first-year students in the first class.
A total of more than 850,000 children will attend primary schools and more than 405 thousand students will be educated in secondary schools, the Ministry of Education estimates.
The new Art Director of News is David Fiala
The new art director of news and advertising of Nova TV has been David Fiala since September 1.
Alan Z<0xC3><0xA1>rub, who has led the creative department of the entire Nova Group since June 1.
David Fiala has previously worked in the graphic department of Z1 news television.
For the past two years, under the leadership of Alan Z<0xC3><0xA1>ruby, he has been involved in the realization of a complete visual transformation of the news reports of Télévisionn<0xC3><0xAD> noviny, St<0xC5><0x99>epina, Pr<0xC3><0xA1>sk! and other publicist TV shows Nova.
David Fiala has very well mastered the synergy of communication between editorial, studio management and graphic department, which is the essence of the work of the art director of journalism.
He has a sense of typography and a clean elegant design, which is the way we want to go further in the visual news of Nova," says creative director of Nova Alan Z<0xC3><0xA1>ruba.
Apple’s iCloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, getting naked pictures of celebrity to the public
Screenshot with printout of escaped files
So far, an anonymous user on the 4chan server has posted nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, the American server Mashable.com has warned.
It has reportedly gained unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple’s servers, where disabled users have been recorded through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet addressed the problem.
Some celebrities reject the images as falsified, but have already acknowledged the authenticity of the images.
Actress Jennifer Lawrence is best known for her role as Katniss in the film series Hunger Games or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who starred in Death Eater 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the obtained images and videos to enrich.
The footage allegedly showed interest in American magazines, according to reports on the 4chan server, but the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web, it’s very likely a weakness in iCloud security.
Two days ago, a tool appeared on GitHub, which made it possible to obtain passwords to user accounts by means of brute force, i.e. by automatic repetition of login attempts with different passwords.
This tool was demonstrably working, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the release of this tool.
iCloud users should therefore, for preventive reasons, change their password associated with Apple ID.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
Suitable is the length of at least 12 characters.
The leak of nude images celebrities consider a reminder of the safe use of online services.
While company servers such as Apple, Google, or Microsoft are secured multiple times better than computers in households or smaller businesses, uploading sensitive photos in unprotected form is a waste of risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt the files before uploading them first.
It is also wise to set up automatic backup of photos from your phone so that it only runs on Wi-Fi and after connecting to the charger.
So you will have the opportunity in time to move sensitive images "to safety", and mainly you will have the space to delete undirected images, so they will not unnecessarily take up space in the online storage.
Instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, we offer readers HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altaira Val<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ka in PDF format.
A Smart Way to Save for a College Script <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Since the price for a college script for many students exceeds $1,000 per year, the upcoming second-year student has come up with a smart way to cut costs.
He invented a system of borrowing books from colleagues from senior years with an offer of nominal compensation to delay their resale.
“The book on calculations, which normally costs $180, I earned for the semester for ten and for chicken nuggets,” says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his final semester would cost $430, he says.
Utratil 120.
According to the University Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and aids, but students have different options on how to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students becomes Internet shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder’s.
On the rise is the loan of textbooks, which allows students to use the semester of the book, often with a significant discount, rather than buying it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 bookstores in campus areas, says book lending has doubled since 2011.
Research in the sector shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of University Businesses, less than half of the textbooks are purchased in university bookstores.
Here are 101 of the best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower on the Internet than in university bookshops.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $290, but on the Internet it is possible to buy it at Chegg.com, a bookstore specializing in textbooks, for $239.99.
Buy used <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
If you don’t mind other people’s comments or wear and tear, the appropriate option is to use textbooks.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents for a used copy of “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” on Amazon.com.
The new one sold for $48.
University lecturer Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s College Without Walls, suggests that students at their teachers check whether older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes to work in seminars are not significant.
If so, older editions can be sold for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is also a popular alternative to buying used books.
Borrowing
It is also worth considering the borrowed textbooks, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and do not need to have them even after the end of the seminar.
You can save up to 80% on the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow “Calculus” for about twenty dollars for the entire semester.
Get acquainted with the terms and conditions of the trade in which you borrow the book, including the effort to note, highlight, or wear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book on time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to buy an e-book instead of a regular e-book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg leases Calculus for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, the most advantageous offers can be found by students of literary courses, as many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go after the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends driving according to the ISBN because it guarantees you are buying the right book.
Before you order a book over the internet, make sure it’s really in stock, advises Gault.
He made sure of it on his own skin.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay a full price for a book from a university bookstore.
Bahno, the mud itself.
And then they found in the well torso a gun from the end of the war
This well is located a short distance from St. George's Church.
We discovered the growth around and we began to pull out the flying saucer - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the wet day, we hit the head," Radomil Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k said.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found out it was the torso of the German assault rifle used by the SS units.
The find is said to be unusual.
According to my information, such guns were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," added Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k.
All wooden construction items have been laid out over time, so it is unusable.
Her body, however, is preserved - it retains its shape.
How was the well?
There is one explanation.
Perhaps it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of weapons used by SS units, probably out of fear that they would not be withdrawn.
Apparently, the fascists on the run would not do that.
They threw guns in the woods," he thought.
The gun was the only thing that the fans of the Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>ka Spirit Movement found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there used to be a lot of grenades around here, so we slowed down the excavation work, we carefully hammered mud so that there was no accident, but there was nothing else down there," Novak said.
The find ends in the depository of the museum at the castle in the nearby Silesian Rudoltics.
Ukraine’s General: I have not yet liberated the occupied Czech Republic
Exclusive interview Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz with the General Staff Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... they're calling me from Donetsk," he apologised eight times during an exclusive interview with the Ukrainian General Staff Volodymyr Ruban, also the director of the local War Liberation Center.
Lieutenant-General Volodymyr Ruban in a televised debate.
With each such interruption, it was not possible to ignore the names of people, their numbers, or the places where they are – or should be – that Ruban specifies with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"That will be it - go there," he concluded one of the flash discussions with Don<0xC4><0x9B>ck and again devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a reserve general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in the anti-government protests in Maidan.
Yesterday, when we had an interview, he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists is dedicated to twenty-four hours a day.
You may know that the Czechs are also fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number to 30.
There can be a lot more of them, though.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have freed the already captured Serbs, Dagest<0xC3><0xA1>n, Chechens, one Swede, Georgians... but not yet Czechs.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we hit your captured countryman and could set him free.
Ukrainian Soldier Captured by Separatists
A.cz: What do you advise the Czechs who are joining the pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers to occupy them?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they fight in the Ukrainian flags of volunteers and separatists occupy them, then they will be shot without mercy, as well as any other foreigner.
Separatists consider these men to be mercenaries, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, the Ukrainian soldiers occupy a group of Donetsk separatists - and among them the Czechs - they put him behind bars and treat him like a prisoner of war.
That guy's gonna be alive soon.
The Ukrainian side also behaves as a state in the war.
A.cz: And how many have you managed to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand it well, I'll exchange it.
According to some sources, it has long been more than a hundred men.
We've long since stopped counting how many people we've helped.
But we just released them... not saved them from the war if they decide to continue fighting.
Rescuers are doctors, surgeons in the war, but we definitely don't.
That's right.
And every day more and more are added.
We'll save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four, sometimes five.
And it doesn’t always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes it is enough to release the prisoners and only human request.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained great authority and even confidence from the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you build respect for both sides of the war?
It's a tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "crazy general with steel balls".
It doesn't offend me.
And it may also detract from the essence of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, I have gained some authority before.
I never cheat, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I'm honest and I'm telling the truth.
Even when it is very unpleasant to the Ukrainian government, or to the Donetsk or Luhansk government.
What if they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them they're torture and they're killing them.
And that they are crimes.
I often risk my life, even in exchange for prisoners and prisoners... this job can mean the end for me at any time... I don't have to come back.
A.cz: How many executions and tortures do you know of prisoners?
... (long blunder) ... Ukrainians and separatists are also reluctant to torture prisoners during the interrogations.
I'm sorry.
And the repairs?
They only happen on the donor side.
The fact that the Ukrainian army is also killing prisoners, I have no information.
There is no indication that the Ukrainian army will allow anything like this.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I can't and don't want to mention the numbers.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are officers, as well as veterans from Afghanistan.
They are trying to achieve independence and perhaps democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk – that’s what they say.
They no longer want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
Separatists already have oligarchs full of teeth and are their inexorable opponents - to life and death.
As we say, they've eaten them all over their throats.
The same dreams and claims were made by people in the Maidan.
And now I am a little suspicious: Russia supports the separatists and the West, on the contrary, the Ukrainian state.
I consider one to be big, and the other to be small.
But this sentence of mine already conceals in itself an incontrovertible contradiction.
A.cz: For example, what do you think of one of the strongest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of the front line, I'm unarmed and show soldiers or gunmen their bare hands.
And I always have both sides of those two hundred or three hundred meters on the fly or in the optical focus.
The faces of the people who target me, I always see well... and they can push the trigger of their weapons at any time.
He was an abductor, an experienced colonel with both German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He is considered to be a Russian officer, but his family – his mother – lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a small governor in the great Russian empire.
In any case, he keeps talking about it and considers Ukraine to be some kind of misunderstanding.
Such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is the unfathomable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters – in the Ukrainian TV talk show, you described your Prime Minister Arseniy Yace<0xC5><0x88>uk as a weak, helpless and tired “leader” who would do best if he left quickly.
I always get at least five times the fear within the three hundred meters of walking.
Why, then, should I keep a secret with the view that Jacenuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harming our country?
A.cz: Do you think there is a share in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that Ukrainians call Jacenuk a "king."
And the rabbit is not an animal in the eyes of the Ukrainians, from which he would go fear or have respect and authority for others.
His behavior directly copies the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as prime minister he has no right to cry in parliament in war, to ask him, to play with him his intrigues, to threaten his position... he must lead the country, manage it and protect it in times of war.
When threatening the country, the prime minister does not have the right to family, friends, rest on paid emotions.
He is the first minister of Ukraine.
And Jacenuk?
She behaves like a pubertal girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak, because he's never been strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just constantly complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy Failed to Save Sales
The lossless 3 Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million from the US budget and Sin City: A woman for whom I would have killed only $12 million from the 70 million budget.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz earned just $14.6 million during the first weekend and also films for children such as How to Train Dragon 2 were a disappointment for the movies.
According to the film critic Robbie Collin in the Telegraph, when it comes to children's films, their own quality is at fault.
Collin called 2014 the “worst” year of children’s films, and How to Train a Dragon 2 he called a “functional” sequel.
When it comes to films set on a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem does not necessarily have to be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average rating of summer film premieres broadcast in at least 2,000 cinemas between the Victims of War Day and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinions of viewers and film critics, suggest that this year’s film yield is similar to last year’s hits.
According to some commentators, a change in audience access and higher popularity of Internet servers like Netflix may be at fault.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's Jungle Book adaptation, told the Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to go after what was already there.
Unlike the current crisis of Hollywood cash marketers, Netflix’s net worth has reached $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year’s $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized studios for relying too much on comic book rights, and predicted Hollywood’s “disruption.”
In the light of the current collapse, some commentators declare that there may be something on his catastrophic preaching.
With the introduction of possible big box office marketers in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimo<0xC5><0x88><0xC5><0xAF> and Jursk<0xC3><0xBD>, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in sales as simply “cyclical.” For Hollywood Reporter, “Next summer will be the summer of the biggest cash marketers in history and no one will worry about selling.”
KLDR again threatens Seoul, fires another short-range missile
North Korea has fired another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul said.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the termination of the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang perceives as preparation for the invasion.
Chagang Province is located in the northwest of the KDLR at the border with China.
A spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, according to the DPA agency, said the missiles had been fired from a location in the northwest of the KLDR and had reached a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea apparently fired a missile from Chagang province for the first time, South Korean media reported, citing military circles.
The province is said to have an underground launch ramp for Scud missiles.
This is another of a series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has conducted in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, protests were held by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
Hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport on Saturday to take part in the anti-NATO campaign.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to the Cardiff City Hall for a meeting that was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation over the weekend and spoke to protesters who had travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers must be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
DVA youth tourists were picked up by plane and transferred to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man set out for a tour of the Govetts Leap in Blackheat on Sunday afternoon.
When they did not return home, the concerned relatives called the police at about eight o'clock in the evening.
A search warrant was issued including a local police and rescue team, and a couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11 p.m.
The girl hit her knee and the man fell down and hit himself in the head.
The police stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stabilized state, the ambulance was transferred to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, he had a win on the leg of Vaj<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek
It was the 23-year-old forvard who could decide, but failed in the two biggest chances.
After the goal, she called for the shot three minutes before the end, but ended up on the goalkeeper of Opava Josef Kv<0xC4><0x9B>to<0xC5><0x88>.
I had it on my feet, I have to give it a chance.
I'm mad at myself," your little ass fell on his head.
"I think I should have put it up under the lid, it bit me," he retorted.
The defensive Sigma did not allow the Opava much, except for Mikul's 11th-minute inning, which however covered the goaltender Reichl.
Then they began to push the Han<0xC3><0xA1>cs, but in a chance they did not let them in the block blocking the home, and shot from a distance captured Kv<0xC4><0x9B>to<0xC5><0x88>.
We compared it for 15 minutes, then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were already better, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But the chance of Vash<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek didn’t change, so it ended 0:0,” Han<0xC3><0xA1>k coach Leo<0xC5><0xA1> Kalvod hated.
The opava point was also taken because of the absences in the composition, where in addition to the two injured, Petr Vav<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k was missing with the three-goal shooter Petr <0xC5><0xA0>ev<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k, who are guests from Sigma in Silesia.
It did not allow them, unlike their previous policy, to intervene.
Replacements deserve an absolutarium.
Sigma worked more football, but we didn’t leave it for anything at one standard,” said Slezan<0xC5><0xAF> coach Petr Bar<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and fighting to be seen.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
The Sigma with a draw got to four points, which means 13th place.
Nothing could satisfy the head of the club Josef Lébra, who, after defeating Znojm, conditioned his million-dollar deposit into the treasury with diametrically different performances in other matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lebra's warning, so it can't be that the boys don't want to fight," remarked Calvoda, adding to the sleeping gunman's address: "I believe it will come and when he hits the goal, it will start to fall there.
But after the first match, I'm going to replace him right away so he can save his goals for the next game," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino beat Venice twice.
The film festival is in crisis.
After a huge enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez I<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xA1>rritu was among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next days gave the impression that interest in the 71st anniversary of the festival in Venice was somewhat diminished.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen hundred, or because after Birdman there were critics recognized, but for the audience less attractive pictures as a document about genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s, the silent and other films from the social themes of the films are based on the themes of the film.
Heroes of Comics
Not even a red carpet in front of the festival palace has so far gone as in the past and it has reportedly ceased to be a problem to get a last-minute spot in the hotel.
There is more talk about the crisis in Italy than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that it has affected institutions as respected as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not a lack of personalities, but present only in connection with the films.
While younger fans longed for the autographs of comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who have successfully hosted dramatic roles in 99 homes in total, for all generations without distinction became the main event of the visit of legendary actor Paacina Ala.
He also starred in two films right now.
In the Out-of-Competition Enlightenment story by Oscar-nominated Barry Levison, based on Philip Roth's novel, the forty-seven-year-old plays the role of Pacino, who is close to him: an actor at the height of fame who suffers from depression from the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him on the second day as a wonderland railroad owner from a rural town in the film Manglehorn, filmed by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for the best acting performance shouldn’t miss it – but does the artist still need Pacin’s format?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, especially the Italian one, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the country from which his ancestors came.
Bodys for Italy
This year’s Italian film is doing very well in Venice.
The Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became Birdman's first film to be rewarded with a long resounding rise.
The Calabrian branch of the mafia is viewed from the perspective of family relations between clans who fight for power and money, and the director was able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: a quality script, a camera, music and an actor.
He also captured the chamber psychothriller The Hungry Heart, which filmed Saverio Costanzo with Albo Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost lost her own child with her slender anxiety.
On the contrary, French competitive films did not expect the warm reception of neither the Buy for Glory, nor the 3 hearts, both of which are based on the traditional model of consumer films based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really great films, namely Birdman and Black Souls, are not so few in the first half of the festival.
And while the festival films have all sorts of depressing themes, a new film by Peter Bogdanovich called She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy set in Venice outside the competition and filmed in the style of American cheerleaders of the 1940s, was able to lift the day to the mood.
Police arrested four pervitin manufacturers in Prague, drugs were used by vehicles from Poland
“The detectives have arrested three men, aged 42, 42 and 37, and a woman of twenty-five years old, who manufactured and sold the drug pervitin in Prague 9 from November to August this year,” police spokesman Jana R<0xC3><0xB6>ssler said.
For the first time on Tuesday, August 12, the intervention unit in Cihl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xA1> Street arrested a 24-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman, who was in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a drug dealer.
The following day, the detectives were detained on the basis of the prior consent of the state representative of another member of the group, namely a seven-year-old man.
The last of the four police officers arrived in the area of the Malaysian incinerator on Wednesday morning, August 20," the spokesman said.
A woman received a third of the drug for the transport of drugs from Poland
The main organizer had a wide field of influence.
In the workshop of the airfield, in the garden house in Horom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice, in the apartment in Kon<0xC4><0x9B>vov street and in other places in Prague 9, he produced pervitin, supplied various aids and chemicals necessary for its production and ensured the transport of medicines from the hounds.
He then weighed the manufactured drug, divided it into plastic bags, and then sold the pervitin.
With the transport of drugs from Poland or the sale of drugs to drug addicts, he was assisted by a twenty-five-year-old woman, who had not yet been punished.
For this she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," added R<0xC3><0xB6>ssler.
On the basis of the order of the judge, the criminals also carried out several home inspections, where they secured drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, payment bags, injection syringes, hoses and other aids and items, which according to the expertise of the manufacturer can be considered complete.
The dealer has been punished seven times since 1995.
"From the available records, the police found that the main organizer had been convicted seven times since 1995 for a property crime, and the woman was not convicted," the police spokesman added.
The last detainee was convicted in 2006 of a felony and a seventy-year-old auto mechanic, who has been convicted of sexual abuse, has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
This was mainly due to his criminal activity as well.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing a criminal offence of illicit production and other handling of mummies and psychotropic substances and poisons, threatening them with up to a decade in prison.
In the case of three persons, the investigator finally gave the representative of the state an incentive to propose to impose the bond, where the judge eventually placed it," the spokesman said.
The fourth accused, a 70-year-old recidivist, has ended in freedom.
His position and role in this case were not as crucial as those of the other defendants.
The police are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers wooden and carbon chess.
As part of its other products, Ferrari offers very interesting things at a lot of "interesting" prices.
As a good example, a hand-made chess with a 42 x 42 cm toy board is used in Italy.
If you like it, prepare for more than $40,000.
The exact price is 43 405 CZK.
The customer obtains a set of wooden black and red lacquered figures stored in a wooden box coated with carbon fibers.
Probably no one will be surprised that instead of the classic rider, the players have available a figure of a spinning horse.
If you don’t think of chess as a valuable gift, the Ferrari 500 F2 is also available (of course manually) in a 1:1,8 scale.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
Disruption of high school and high school makes no sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people and statistics also show that high school students have good application.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There has been a lot of preparation in the schools in the last 14 days.
It is usually a routine matter, such as transferring the flower buds from the summer storage facility back to the classroom and phasing out the chalks.
At the bitter gymnasium, they will have a slightly larger frmol.
A few days before the start of the season, furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature are taken to the library.
There was no robbery or deception, the four-year gymnasium in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice opens and renews its activity after three years.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not caused by the fact that the founders are so incompetent.
They had to wait for the existence of the school to be confirmed by entering the register of schools managed by the M<0xC5><0xA0>MT.
“The French socialists should shut up and put France in order,” says key ally Francoise Hollande.
Valls calls on the strongly split left to "show its support" to a militantly-advised socialist president whose new division of functions was not met with the consent of most Frenchmen.
The President deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay by his side," he said, squeezing.
As a reassuring gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial French thirty-five-hour work week, despite the passionate compromises made by Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who will be elected at the outset.
On Saturday, Hollande called on the socialists to remain “consistent” with the government.
Christiane Taubirov<0xC3><0xA1>, the justice minister, made a line through his budget when she appeared at a meeting of the rebel socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for having “lost faith in the future” because of her.
Marine Le Pen, a leader of the ultra-conservative right, laughed at the persistent internal disputes between socialists when she said she did not expect the new Valls government to last longer than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls, too, was forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new won't last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen told her fans.
She reiterated her party's call to dissolve Parliament and said she was convinced that the party could win early elections and that it was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections and in May the extremely conservative right succeeded in the elections to the European Parliament.
According to a survey by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting up into several rival factions before the end of Holland’s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French would soon have patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
“It’s a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there are changes in the situation,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
Hazard and street art no longer limit Prague to elections
Amendments to the relevant declarations should prepare and approve until the new management of the capital.
Other games will not disappear from the streets of Prague before the municipal elections and the city will not restrict street art.
There will be no restrictions on the marriage of dogs.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve the amendments to the relevant declarations in the representation in the October elections.
“Additionally, the decision on the changes should not be made by the current leadership of the city, which ends in a few weeks of mandate,” said Mayor Lukash Manhart (TOP 09).
Over the past few weeks, several municipalities, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to cancel the flat gambling in their territory.
But Hernandez won't disappear, and the gambling announcement won't change yet.
It is the task of the new leadership of the city after the elections.
Now we wouldn’t be able to do it technically, for example, due to timeframes for commenting and the like,” Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current representative, who is to approve the amendment, will take place on 11 September.
A referendum on a flat-out ban on gambling will be held on the day of the municipal elections of the Prague 1 and Prague 8.
Currently, the gambling ban is valid for example in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The declaration will not change for the same reasons, even in the case of street art, the so-called busking.
This is particularly the case in Prague 1, which has already sent a proposal to the master’s degree, about which it would like to expand the current list of prohibited places.
Musicians also don't want Prague 5 in the vicinity of An<0xC4><0x9B>l.
The announcement regulating the marriage of dogs of the city is going for several months, it is not yet complete.
The location of herens and the problem of searching solves the urban declaration.
It can only be issued or edited by the representative of the capital.
Councillors have only an advisory voice, they are not allowed to make statements themselves.
Last week placed the victory for the proposers of Scottish independence at the reach of the hand
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making this mistake for the third time when it almost put on billboards across Scotland the question of whether Scotland wants to be rich.
But you won’t get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallets, nor will you gain their respect when you start threatening them.
The morality of the New Law is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
The Scots have a far greater tendency to expel the monks from the temple than to let them dictate how they should vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and so he repeatedly asked his rival, Unionist Darling, whether he was willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people", if Scottish voters voted for independence, and to start a campaign for support.
This Darlinga forced him to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and with grimace fell into this trap.
Of course, Darling will not support the mandate of Scottish voters.
However, the discussion about Scotland’s currency has already been more or less neutralised.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and the defence of public health, which citizens have for free.
Darling supported London bankers on the currency issue and also gave the impression that he would not protest the privatisation of health care.
As Salmond said, "he went to bed with the Conservatives."
This is a very dangerous situation for every Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke not to voters in Scotland, but to the "boss" association, to the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron’s refusal to discuss independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a scared absent-minded housewife.
Scotland would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron has at least been able to say that Scotland can be a "successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost physical pain.
What he communicates is clear: Scots do not have to jump out and have to accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.

Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Urban Longest year
The end of the holiday was the best, the last week we had gone nowhere and we just cried and swam with Grandma in the summer, quiet before the storm, calm before the stress.
New clothes, when it was possible to get from Tuzex, boots from eastern Germany.
Reading the Quick Arrows, already in the fall, gliding on a mountain bike around the Empire to the back behind the Vary, somewhere to the tennis courts, there was no more heat, the sun smoothed the back and shoulders, blinked rays on the farewell.
In the evening, mild nervousness, still a holiday mode, sleeping until midnight, in the week it will be worse, the moment before falling asleep they stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then in the morning they wake up at half-seventh.
He's coming Monday.
Most of the time it doesn’t rain, on the contrary, summer is cursed in front of the school.
To swim in a ghostly light on a plate and to look like a plastic figure in a glass vase, there is this school, ZD<0xC5><0xA0> A.
The backside with a luscious pink lipstick, and in front of it old familiar faces even a few new, boys taller, girls more titty.
There's gravel here, to avoid them, it's just as interesting how infallibly it keeps the group together and how fast they're here.
And these grown-up-looking girls who came screaming are now laughing hysterically at something, maybe something has changed in their lives over the holidays, while I've got it all in the old one.
And again, new beginners, some nervous and other pleasures, why are they even lying here?
Because he has to, the education war obliges.
So inside, the cool humidity of the floor and the slight smell of disinfection, the poisoned schoolboy with the mope, unfortunately still the same as what the student said will borrow the key from the tin box, where they can leave the textbooks and which are still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dress remains in memory, now it is not done, it is well ventilated, but in a week it will be worse.
It’s only from that idea that the stomach boils and begins to hurt the head.
The head, which is even worse understood by the teaching of mathematics, is the devil’s game for the chosen, which I do not belong to and will never be.
Again those threes and fours, don't give up fives, hide from the test, fall into the sink and best to sublimate, not to be there, only to exist as a name in the classroom, and to dream of stories about nicer girls and nicer buildings, not to be seen, not to be seen, not to be seen, not to be seen, not to be seen, not to be seen, not to be seen, but to be seen,
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now as it was years ago.
My daughter-in-law died.
She is threatened with an exceptional punishment - News.cz
The first birth occurred in March 2012 in the public toilet cabin at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without any help, she was born a little girl, who, after cutting the puppy into a ready blanket, hid under a jacket and took it to a road sweeper, where she put it in the bushes a few tens of meters from the road.
Born on the way to school
It came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
In the bus I needed to go to the bathroom, there I was born.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with the scissors I wore to school," she said, adding that she was ashamed of her pregnancy.
"The next day she returned to the place, put the child's body in the bag and took it away, took the body out of the bag, wrapped it in a black bag and hid it and left under the stairs in her grandmother's house in Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> Broda," the young man in the suit said.
It could be in tens of minutes, but also a few hours after giving birth, choking when covering the blanket or putting under the jacket, cooling or bleeding out of the unbound diaper.
The same scenario was repeated in the spring of next year.
A woman in an unknown time from February to April 12, when the child's body was found by random witnesses under the sink near a pond in Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kobrodsk, again gave birth secretly.
This time in the bathroom of the attic apartment in the family house.
Without verifying whether she was born alive, without cutting and tying the umbilical cord, which was wrapped around her neck, she placed the child in several plastic containers, including a needle bag, and left him in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his partner were taken to the pond.
Finally a friend gave it to her.
The father of the two children was just a friend of the defendant, who did not know about the partners' pregnancies.
For this reason, they do not stand before the court now, only he was punished for a crime against the Funeral Act.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like that he's not being punished as an accomplice.
He was manipulating the child against my wishes.
I know my solution wasn’t right, but I felt human at the time,” she said, not hiding the anger of the accused, who allegedly succumbed to the man’s relationship and feared him.
During her speech, the young woman spoke fairly evenly.
Tears lingered in her eyes until the moment she spoke of a relationship with her parents, from whom she left after reaching adulthood.
She said she didn't want to kill
“They come to visit me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don’t deserve it,” she said.
I didn't buy the equipment because I didn't want the kids, I looked young.
I wanted to put him in the baby box, but I don't know what happened, because I didn't do that.
I can't explain it to you," the judge replied.
However, she refused to deal with the thought and intention of killing the newborn.
The second child, according to her claim, was also born dead.
Even during her pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
But I limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
“I’ve also been smoking,” she said.
Although pregnancy was seen on both occasions, she claimed to have health problems that she was pregnant, even on repeated questions.
And so is my friend.
The main characterisation will continue on Tuesday with the statements of the court experts at the castle court.
On Wednesday, the verdict could have been handed down.
A woman is threatened with up to 18 years in prison, or with exceptional punishment.
Norwegian Cruise is close to three billionth acquisition of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the whole matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the world’s third-largest cruise ship operator, has made progress in negotiating the purchase of Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
The deal by Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, which competes with greater competition from Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), has provided access to the luxury cruise ship Prestige Cruises and the wealthy clientele.
The deal may be released as early as this week, the source said on Sunday, but cautioned that the negotiations still do not have to end successfully.
Prestige Cruises, a private investment firm of Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want to be named because the negotiations were not public.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, the Apollo spokesman declined to comment on the situation.
The Miami-based Norwegian Cruise operates thirteen cruise ships on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, up 13 percent from 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together owns eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
In 2013, the company announced sales of $1.2 billion, up 6% from the previous year.
It is expected that the twenty-ninth billion segment of cruise ships will benefit from the rise of the middle class in growing economies such as China and India in the coming year.
The companies are competing to make these customers a preferred option when choosing a cruise ship.
Prestige Cruises registered its first public offering with U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has a majority stake in the company since 2007 since the closing of the $850 million deal.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when it merged with the tour operator Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure and casino businesses controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in the Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise introduced shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration with the regulatory authorities by the end of June, Genting owned a capital share of 28 %, Apollo 20 % and private investment company TPG Capital LP 8 %.
According to the registration documentation of the first public offering, Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together comprise 82% of the volume of North American passengers.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong provoke Chinese authorities a day after the decision to vote
There was a group of people loyal to Beijing who were carrying the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved that only two out of three candidates would take part in the 2017 Hong Kong elections.
All candidates must first get the support of the nomination committee, which is likely to consist of members of the Beijing loyalists.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get ballots and force pro-democracy activists to renew the promise and protect Hong Kong’s financial center from protests by the “Occupational Central” movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main cause of tension, with Chinese leaders worried that the demand for democratization would expand to other cities.
After Beijing released a detailed report in June on China’s official power in Hong Kong, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district and hundreds of thousands of people entered the city’s streets and entered the city’s trade hall.
The press conference, which will be attended by Prime Minister Li, is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of the State Council of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Authority Feng Wei were also to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists said they would meet in front of the Hong Kong government’s offices this afternoon.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin calls on Kiev to start talks with eastern Ukraine on "state sovereignty"
According to a description of the events by Russian newspapers, on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on "state sovereignty" of the deprived areas.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin had no intention of indicating that the regions of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reassessed so that the Russian-speaking areas would be given power and power.
Putin’s call to the Kiev government to deal with the pro-Russian rebels as equals corresponds to the obvious strategy, according to which it is guided from the outbreak of unrest five months ago: Help the separatists to occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to resign from the nobility
In an interview for the first state television channel, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions aimed at recapturing the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were controlled by separatists in March and April after Moscow on March 18 annexed the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine.
The Kremlin and the separatists of the newly occupied territories referred to as "New Russia" or "New Russia", a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Russia’s Itar-Tass news agency published Putin’s words that “the prison of illusions” is anyone who believes there are peace talks on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians launched a separatist campaign ahead of the October 26 parliamentary elections, while the ruling elites of the unit are ruling.
"In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately begin meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and on the status of state sovereignty of southeastern Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to state sovereignty was conceived in the context of broader autonomy, which has been under Kiev’s leadership for several months and which is intended to alleviate Russian-speaking concerns about the threat of cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that the necessary autonomy can only be granted by the Ukrainian government to the eastern region.
It is not a matter of negotiation between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The Kremlin’s move, which was supposed to correct the “wrong interpretation” of Putin’s remarks, underscored Russia’s approach to resolving the separatist uprising in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where the majority of the two-million-strong population is originally Russian.
Moscow would have much greater difficulty annexing both Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and public opinion polls that have been held before the conflict have shown broad support for survival in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have been talking about at international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, and essentially give the Kremlin effective control over the territory, which would connect the Russian mainland with the Khem.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia’s main naval fleet, maritime trade base and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia's Rostov and Crimea are also the center of the down, factories and foundries, which produce important components for the Russian army.
During his inaugural speech on June 7, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers - after the new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give various regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy is very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatists, and Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin’s last call for Kiev to treat separatists as equals was followed by a further move by rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks penetrated eastern Ukraine from a formerly peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.
Separatist Russian forces have taken control of Novoazovsk by such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that it is a move to occupy strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This accelerated a huge civil and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and a narrow gateway to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the European Union’s top representatives in Brussels on Saturday and called for an action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for the past 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
On the territory of Ukraine, there are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps – leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of a closer unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kyiv on Saturday that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaj after last week's two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 vehicles were seized.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in Ilovaysk during the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian bombers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved in the scandal with the leaked photos.
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his dissatisfaction with the hackers, who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancee Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit nude photos by Jennifer Lawrencov<0xC3><0xA1> were leaked to the internet in the biggest scandal with hacked photos.
Hacker claims to have sixty photos with the naked star Hunger Games Lawrenco and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariany Grande and Ley Michell and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Due to the escape from iCloud, the public also reportedly received personal photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Greece.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who asked Greece for a hand last month, told Confidential magazine: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondences and all private images should remain private. . . .
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and disseminated to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, told reporters online that the hack was “unsatisfying” and those who became its target “are feeling humiliated.”
It is believed that the hacker obtained thirty photos of Palmer with his former friend Scott Speedman, including two pictures, on which he undisclosed at the pool.
Palmer acted for example in the film Love and Honor, where she was opposite Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of the television series Chuck Strahovski and actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen footage yesterday.
The representative of the Lawrenc TMZ said: "This is a clear violation of privacy."
Seth Rogen, a hacker, tweeted: “Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma footballers have made Lébra comfortable, even without winning
Olomouc - The thunder and lightning that the co-owner of the Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr sent to his subordinate last week are, it seems, a past.
After all, the Opava brought only the point for the unbranded remix.
After all, the club boss’s deployment and combat skills were only a little bit more comfortable.
The money for the payouts could come to the club soon.
"I'm going to leave one more game as I talked about it last week, but I'm much more optimistic," Lebr confirmed that despite Sigma's failure to win, his players were convinced by improved performance.
“The fighting and commitment we played with, especially in the second half, was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive that he won't win.
If we had played that way since the start of the season, I’m sure we haven’t lost yet,” says Lebr.
Sigma in Opava stopped the initial pressure of the domestics, then settled the game and in the second half it was already better.
After the victory, the Kalvod's confidants scored, but they didn't get their chances, so they couldn't win.
The result is not in our opinion.
But to our complete satisfaction, we lacked only one changed chance," said Lebr, who does not think that the change in the approach of the footballers caused only his threat.
There must have been more aspects.
Whether it’s on my side, the coach’s side, or the fans’ side,” Lebr said.
The pressure must be calculated by Sigma.
The players did not want to comment much after the game in Opava from last week's event.
I'm trying to get these things out of the way.
I tried not to admit it," the young goalkeeper Michal Reichl shook his head.
Without comment, he then left a question on the statement made by last week's striker V<0xC3><0xA1>clav V<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who did not turn the biggest opportunity of Sigma into a Saturday game.
But then he talked a little bit about the pressure.
We'll always be under pressure.
Everybody wants to pull on us.
Today we showed that if we fight and drive all the ass, it's going to work," he said.
They took the warning to their hearts.
Even coach Leo<0xC5><0xA1> Kalvoda did not claim that preparation for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was evident that Mr. Lebra's warning was taken to heart.
Even though it wasn’t about them not wanting to fight before, they didn’t want to fight,” said the Olomouc coach.
It was like the first 15 minutes today.
It took us to compare ourselves to the tough and realize what the second league is all about.
"It's not just about football, it's about fighting," Kalvoda said.
It remains to be hoped that in the next games the Sigma will work from the beginning.
"I'd love to believe that," he added.
