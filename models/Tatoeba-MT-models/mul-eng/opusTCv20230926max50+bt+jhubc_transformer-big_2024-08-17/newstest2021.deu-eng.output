Biker reacts flash fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a road accident occurred on the highway between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his rapid response.
The driver overlooks the biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left onto Landesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim with her VW from Merklingen at around 9.30 pm.
In doing so, she oversaw the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from Nellingen.
During the collision, hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker was still trying to get away from the car, still strangling it in the rear of the vehicle.
The hand- and foot-brake lever were broken off at the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
At present, he steered his motorcycle into the green bars next to the road and let it roll out there without falling into it.
Biker suffers leg injury
However, due to the collision with the car, the biker suffered an injury to the leg and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest helpers infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Lower Bavarian Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the exit ban.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positive for the Sars-CoV-2 corona challenger during the series investigation, as announced by the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau on Saturday evening.
“To avoid further spread, we unfortunately need to take this step to protect the population,” said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the plant - this was the reason for the reintroduction test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm, which grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beet - but the cucumbers only for inlay glasses.
Mamming is a rural municipality with a population of about 3,300 people near Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep quiet: "According to our information, this is a closed circle of people".
In the yard, infected people were separated from uninfected employees, and the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
Greens and SPD shared responsibility with the state government.
The two opposition factions have accused Prime Minister Markus S<0xC3><0xB6>der (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of seasonal workers’ homes.
"This can be a bitter revenge if such local infectious events take place and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
The SPD sees this in a similar way: “After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control program for farms with harvesters,” said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
“It is precisely the hygiene conditions in the workplace and the living conditions that need to be strictly controlled from our point of view.
That obviously didn't happen."
The explosion came “with an announcement.”
Underground station Aidenbachstra<0xC3><0x9F>e: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls after Schubser into the gleisbett
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstra<0xC3><0x9F>e subway station, a 19-year-old man fell by a pusher and slipped into a sliding bed.
Obersendling - On Friday there was a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstra<0xC3><0x9F>e subway station at about 4.15 pm.
A passerby alerted the police, who approached with several stripes.
According to the first investigation, a 17-year-old Munich man threw a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slid over the escalator and fell into the track bed.
People from the 17-year-old group helped the crasher climb out of the track.
There was no danger of an incoming train.
According to the police, there were clashes between the two people.
The 17-year-old fled the scene at first, but his personnel could be identified afterwards.
accompanied by his father, he went to the police inspectorate 29.
The 17-year-old is diagnosed with a body injury.
Report: Seehofer urges longer storage of inventory data
The stock data storage is currently suspended.
Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage period, according to a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for an extended storage of inventory data – instead of the planned ten weeks and a half a year, according to a media report.
As the "Picture on Sunday" reports, Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a rapid change of law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to "make urgently needed adjustments to the law already now," the paper quotes from the letter.
At the moment, stock data storage is suspended.
A decision of the ECHR is expected to do so.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments to be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report says.
A spokesman for the Justice Department told the newspaper that it would only make sense to examine whether there would be a need for legal adjustments if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already spoken out in June for stockpile data storage.
NBA: Stripclub trouble for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams, 33, a basketball pro for the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, he still visited the "Magic City" strip club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted to the visit according to ESPN data, is back in Isloation, being tested for Covid-19 daily.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Am. d. R.) have the best wings in the city".
NBA insider Shams Charania on Sunday announced on Twitter that the NBA Williams has ordered a 10-day quarantine.
As a result, the Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
Currently, the top 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finale starting on Friday night.
S<0xC3><0xB6>der speaks out after mass infection to the Corona situation
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced on Sunday a textile strain for large farms.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the Dingolfing-Landau district has alarmed authorities and politicians.
The large vegetable farm currently employs almost 500 harvesters from several countries, over a third of whom have been infected with the coronavirus.
The yard is now under quarantine and is closed with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The municipality’s 3,300 residents are now offering free Corona tests.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the Land Council Office so far assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the yard.
"Conscience Bisse": Confession of the alleged founder of Nantes
“My client has shown himself to be cooperative,” attorney Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defender added: "He regrets the actions very much, the confession was a release for him".
His mandate was “plunged by bits of conscience and greatly taken from the extent of destruction.”
In the event of a conviction, the man is threatened with ten years’ imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been badly damaged in a fire on Saturday last week.
The fire broke out in three places far from each other in the church.
Laboratory examinations exacerbated the suspicion of a fire foundation.
The arrested suspect had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
After a day, he was released again.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
As there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly entered the field of inquiry.
Discussing the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB president Reinhard Grindel has recommended to think about abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," Grindel said of the "picture on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to become dangerous in Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
So far, we are not going to get around the debate on whether or not it is not required to facilitate the inclusion of investors, associations that want to break into this phalanx."
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority stakes, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
“There remains a legal risk of attracting investment fences around the Bundesliga’s economic location in a European single market,” Grindel said.
The former DFB head sees the risk that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but do not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an even distribution of the TV funds will not have a decisive effect.
FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," the 58-year-old said.
Looking back on the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and gone through the press instead of addressing it," Grindel said of the adoption of an expensive watch that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
“It has already been very human to me.”
He received the gift worth about 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
“I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it,” Grindel said.
"With the ominous watch gift, I have been completely transparent and argonously treated.
A lot of people in the DFB knew about it.”
He never “made a hoax out of the gift,” the 58-year-old said.
"This may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and a Dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have again been targeted by Donald Trump’s use of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, clashes broke out between protesters and police in various cities.
In Louisville, three people were injured and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was killed by gunshots while a demonstration train just crossed a junction.
Earlier, clashes had occurred again in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including officers of the Federal Police, used tear gas on Saturday night and violently drove protesters from each other.
Hundreds of partially armed protesters marched through Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for Breonna Taylor’s death be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot in March at a drug raid in her Louisville apartment.
The target of the raid was someone else who didn’t even live there, and no drugs were found either.
When a member of a group, calling themselves an armed alliance of black Americans, fired a shot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to the NBC channel, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger of life.
The police set up barricades because counter-protesters of a white militia had also formed.
In the end, there was no meeting between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and killed during a “Black Lives Matter” demonstration.
According to the police, a suspect was taken into custody.
Further details on the circumstances of the act have not been made so far.
Mayor Steve Adler told the New York Times that, like many in the city, he was "uneasy and uneasy" about what had happened.
Protesters also clashed with the police in the American metropolis of Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to a youth prison building cars, and the police used blend grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police officers or bodily injury.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters have knocked on windows, shot down fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday evening (local time).
The fire could be quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
According to police, one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to the hospital injured.
In addition, windows were also struck in a courthouse and a fire was set, police said.
Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the large sauce in the spa town lacked, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without the Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the large party miles in the city center were missing, burning crowds and program highlights like Saale, Rakoczy ball or party train, many of the Corona-compliant alternative program came at their expense.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy-Flair," says Sylvie Thormann, director of the board of directors.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, as well as the historical ones alone in the focus of the festival.
A pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konh<0xC3><0xA4>user has been visiting Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
This time in the year of Corona.
The couple has made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold casino, watching the historical ones while strolling and listening to Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I think it's very pleasant," says Konh<0xC3><0xA4>user.
She misses the masses of people who otherwise do not belong to Rakoczy.
For this, however, you will miss the usual program highlights, especially the burning rooms on Friday evening as well as the historic procession and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"It's already a shame.
The weather would have been great this year,” she said.
Rakoczy race tournament to be held again
For the performers of the historical curricula, the alternative program meant some more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who participates in the festival in a normal year and can be seen there on the cushion of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was walking in costume on Saturdays and Sundays in the city.
“It’s more difficult, otherwise we’ll have it easier,” she says.
The riding club had less to do, even though individual riders were on their way to the park.
“We very much hope that the riding squad will be able to take place again next year,” said Ulrike Waldhofen, chairman of the board.
She announced that after several years of break in 2021, a Rakoczy riding tournament will also take place again.
28 Corona cases in Spanish second league player Fuenlabrada
Spanish football second-legist CF Fuenlabrada is slipping deeper into the crisis due to a Corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from close to Madrid had flown to a game in the city of A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a on July 20 despite the first Corona cases, one hit follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positive, one came to the hospital, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name, southwest of Madrid, has so far had a chance to reach the ascent playoffs.
Now even the decline in the B-group of the Second League is threatening.
The game against Deportivo La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the state attorney’s office determined due to a possible crime against public health, the top sports authority CSD considering the forced decline of the club.
The players and other team members sit in a hotel in Quarantine.
“Until the sixth day of quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel and gel,” wrote the sports newspaper AS.
In the photos you can see how players would have hung underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel for drying after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
Even the bed linen had not been changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
“It’s neither good nor good enough,” he wrote.
The club management, however, said they were satisfied with the hotel.
The charge of deliberately endangering public health was rejected by the club’s lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
They did not violate the Corona rules set up by the Football Association, the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before the departure, there were four infected persons until 19 July, all of whom had been isolated and had not travelled with them.
Just before Monday’s flight to A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, all players and team members had been tested again.
When the team was already in A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, it was positive for "five or six" other team members of the Corona Test.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the touchdown, said Tebas Llanas.
Police have to catch horses pulled out by steampach
Two animals were on the road.
The police took her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning, just before 6 a.m., a traffic participant shared two free-running horses on the feeder between the Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld inlet and the Theres motorway terminal.
Upon the arrival of the officials, the horses were already again between the Zubringer and the village of Dampbach.
After the officers were able to gain the confidence of the horses just before steaming, they were each able to wrap themselves around a rope carried in the striped carriage.
Cyclists Tony Martin: Career Continuation imaginable
Time travel specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time world champion Tony Martin can certainly imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm currently working with the team on the framework conditions for how and in what form it could proceed," the 35-year-old told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
The negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
Earlier he had woken up after a fall, and the first thought had been: "Quick back on the bike.
Today I think as the father of a little daughter: What if".
The cyclist admitted that there are aspects with which he is increasingly difficult to deal with.
"But it was good for me to remember what I have in cycling and how much fun it makes me."
During the Tour de l'Ain (5th to 9th August) the time travel specialist enters the competition again.

For at least three people, the tour ends with the motorcycle fatally.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also died.
Sch<0xC3><0xB6>nthal - Several, mostly young people, died in accidents on the streets of Bavaria on the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was picked up on Saturday at Sch<0xC3><0xB6>nthal (Cham County) by a car that came on the opposite side.
Why the car got to the opposite track was not clear at first.
In Upper Bavaria on Saturday, a 22-year-old man on his machine collided with a horse-drawn carriage.

In a left-hand corner, he ran against the cushion.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the accident site.
Of the 12 hostages, one man was seriously injured and one man was slightly injured, police said.
Another fatal accident in the Upper Palatinate Bad K<0xC3><0xB6>tzting killed an 18-year-old.
He had set himself on a road on Sunday night and was over-rolled by a 42-year-old driver.
According to police, the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver could no longer brake in time.
At Sch<0xC3><0xB6>nberg (county of Freyung-Grafenau), a 57-year-old biker collided in a right-hand corner despite full braking frontal against a car on Saturday.
He died at the crash site.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, leaving the remaining three people in the car unharmed.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavarian Transport Minister Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organiser of the biker protests against driving bans announced for August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister referred to extensive investments such as underpass protection on board and the de-escalation of dangerous curves.
"We have achieved a lot in the past years for the safety of motorcyclists," the letter said.
"The number of killed motorized two-wheelers decreased by about 28 percent compared to 2011".
Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac, his new club AS Monaco will soon see Eintracht Frankfurt.
The eight-time French champion will be visiting the Hesse, the former club of Croatia, on 1 August at 6 p.m.
For the Bundesliga, it is the first and only test of hardness before replay in the Europa League against FC Basel (August 6).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the meeting is held without spectators.
“We are particularly looking forward to this game.
It’s always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends,” Kovac said.
“It’s an interesting test,” the 48-year-old said.
Prior to his move to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached the Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led to victory in the DFB Cup.
“A high-profile opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again,” said Eintracht coach Adi H<0xC3><0xBC>tter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had agreed to the succession of Croatia.
In March, the Frankfurters had lost the eight-final match against Basel in their own stadium by 0:3.
Almost 50 new infections: Hof County is just over the lockdown
In the Hof district, the number of known coronavirus infections on the weekend has increased further: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person is cured and no longer falls into this statistic) to 47 on Sunday.
There is also a case in the town of Hof.
Thus, the Hof area approaches the critical brand of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in a week.
700 dead in monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, especially in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
Due to heavy monsoon rains, a total of 700 people were killed.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach isolated people in boats.
Entire villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Panzernashorns in National Park die of landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tank horns died from landslides.
They are under protection and are considered to be at risk of extinction.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which results in knowledge gaps due to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In the town of Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 by the Flute Distributed.
So far, only a few have been involved.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazar.
There is also enthusiasm in Grenezn.
Those who used to have a house, it was still so small and similar to a cottage, often do not want to spend their lives in a large block of living.
Many apartments are empty, but - as the government wants - will soon be taken over by those who have lost their house due to the floods.

Argentina rejects offer of counter-offers from creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires said on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," it said in a statement.
“While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors.”
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer viable under the current conditions.
That’s why Argentina is calling on its private creditors to waive some of its claims of around $66 billion (around $59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country will again be threatened by the coup d'état.
It would be the ninth payment failure in Argentine history.
Lately, lenders have demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government remains firm on its last offer and is not ready for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
Last year, the inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power by around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to meet interest claims of $503 million and was thus spared in a limited payment default.
Professionally arrived - not yet private
"It's going great" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will be succeeding Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelder Notariatsstelle.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctorate lawyer took up the job, the normal day-to-day business is long on full tours.
“But I still have to arrive in private,” she explains in the conversation with the Rottaler indicator and laughs.
The short lead time, of course, was not enough to move the food center from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfinger.
She is currently with her husband, who works in Regensburg as a judge at the district court, looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave in the short term to ensure the care of the two daughters (31<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 and 11<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she sometimes also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
Growing up in the neighbouring county, the city of Eggenfelden has long been a term for her.
During visits with her family in recent months, she then re-established: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
All the more pleased she was that she did the race in the selection process around the free seat.
Even in Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s professional career, her home Niederbayern plays a central role: after studying law in Passau, she completed her referenda time and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several posts as a notary assistant, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in the Unterallg<0xC3><0xA4>u and Regensburg - during this time she also "besides" the promotion in labour law - she entered her first position as a notary in Rotthalm<0xC3><0xBC>nster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she went into parenting, it was finally followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notaries.
When the position in Eggenfelden was due to Lutz Feller’s impending retirement, she saw the right time for the full career re-entry, the 39-year-old explained.
Her predecessor’s team, who will be taking over the notary’s holiday office in the future, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely – and immediately has a praise for the law firm’s team: “It’s running super good!”
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
In terms of kindergartens and cribs, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here too soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging trails of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not be even 20 percent filled for the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
“Due to the distance regime that is mandatory, we plan to have 12,000 to 15,000 spectators at the current level,” Carsten Cramer, CEO of Borussia Dortmund, told the Daily Mirror.
Normally, the arena in the revierstadt holds a little more than 81,000 spectators in Bundesliga games.
In the ghost games of the last season caused by the Corona pandemic, the BVB had lost around four million euros per game.
The Cramer responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB hopes that, in addition to the normal audience seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality sector can also be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely break away".
In the face of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable sideline for the first time".
“If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-term work alone in Germany, then the need for entertainment is limited,” Cramer said.
The head of marketing at Dortmund praised the BVB professionals for their pay-per-view, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: “Of course, players know that their pay-per-view has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-term work.”
Tiny Miracles: Early Start to Life with a Few Hundred Grams
Hardly heavier than a packerl butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of around 400 early mornings that are cared for annually at the Graz Children’s Clinic.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few – like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael – are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Your skin is sometimes so delicate that it could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini-windows specially made for them.
But not so small that they would not be at voice - "and how", says Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if they don't scream quite as loud as big babies."
When the Whiteboard Goes to the Stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of St. James High School in Abtsgm<0xC3><0xBC>nd just before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater of the City of Aalen presented the students with the production "Das Heimatkleid" - by video.
The students were then able to exchange the play and the performance via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias.
Born was the idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of the teaching.
Although in the end all the participants agreed that the direct meeting in the theatre and stage room would offer additional attractions, you can also see the potential for contact in the schools in the theatre.
“If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation,” said Winfried Tobias, director.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would meet at Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup

This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents are set in the first round of the DFB Cup.
The Lions would meet at Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because due to the Corona pandemic the participant field is not yet complete, space holders were used in the drawout.
Due to the voluntary resignation of semi-final opponents FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4th or 5th September).
There the lions meet either the W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburg Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should the second-league climber W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburg reach the final, Sixty would have already qualified for the first round of the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to get through in the final game against regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be held between 11 and 14 September and thus a week before the start of the third league.
"From the Wind": Olivia de Havilland is dead
The film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died on Sunday in Paris at the age of 104 of a natural death, her spokeswoman for the German press agency confirmed.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the South American epic "Wanted by the Winds" (1939).
Born to British parents in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a child.
The Austrian playwright Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Shakespeare's Hermia "Summer Night's Dream".
The Warner Brothers film studio signed her for seven years and brought her out big on the side of Eroll Flynn.
Eight films were shot with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Mother's Heart".
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress".
She has also received much recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Pit".
Daphne du Maurier proposed her in 1952 for the lead role in the film of her novel "My Cousine Rachel".
The piece became a worldwide success.
With her longtime girlfriend Bette Davis, she played in "Wiegenlied f<0xC3><0xBC>r une corps".
From his marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953), Benjamin’s son emerged.
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had his daughter Gis<0xC3><0xA8>le with him.
This marriage also broke down.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss final at Comeback
Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf, they defeated their national teammates Nils Ehlers and Lars Fl<0xC3><0xBC>ggen by 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Thole/Wickler last played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September last year.
In the final match at the Rhine, their Ehlers/Fl<0xC3><0xBC>ggen were defeated by the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with a 0:2 (17:21, 17:21) defeat.
In addition to the show tournament, three starting points for the German Championships were played at Timmendorfer Strand in early September: the tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peem<0xC3><0xBC>ller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz draft from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the FDP's point of view only a "fingerprint" and does not change the character of the party.
“The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD,” said FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The AfD’s Federal Arbitration Court on Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of negotiation, confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority vote in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburg Landtag.
"If the AfD really were to remove right-wing extremists from their party consistently, officials like Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn H<0xC3><0xB6>cke and his supporters would have long been excluded," Strasser said.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: “The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and changes nothing,” he told the “World on Sunday”.
"It speaks volumes as to how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD."
Blume predicts that the AfD will fall below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons for the now officially dissolved "flying" around the Thuringian AfD country and faction president Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn H<0xC3><0xB6>cke; the constitutional protection instills the stranglehold as a "secured right-wing extremist effort".
In May, AfD leader Kalbitz had thrown out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz did not specify a previous membership in the now-prohibited far-right "Heimattr<0xC3><0xBC>uen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans at his party entrance.
Kalbitz contests membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing group in the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf ate only chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz".
Neither the Federal Party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troop is predictable.
We want to avoid further observation by constitutional protection and try to get under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not let go of the spirits she called.
A draft does not change that yet," commented the Brandenburg SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here kept the AfD-Landesverband and the faction to this day their right-wing leader".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz’s membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he will now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Court of Arbitration.
North Sea wind farms deliver 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind power plants in the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid.
That’s well 21 percent more than in the same period last year, said network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity network.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to the Tennet network area, have fed a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind flow from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea is 13.73 TWh, compared with 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The winds at sea make up almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany; that’s about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide for higher generation capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy results in the addition to the wind conditions from higher generation capacities, because in the last 12 months new wind farms have been added to the grid.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea all run at the same time with full power, they could generate a total of 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; it is 7.1 gigawatts, according to Tennet.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
“In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections until then,” said Tim Meyerj<0xC3><0xBC>rgens, CEO of Tennet.
In reality, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity even at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gm<0xC3><0xBC>nder Kunstverein.
It was almost a small anniversary celebration at 130.
Birthday of the Gm<0xC3><0xBC>nder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual frame after the Corona break.
Much more art friends than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the art association, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent supplied the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern corn house square.
North of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" was engaged.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival scheduled for September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We certainly did not make this decision lightly and - conscious of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partially).
“But in the end, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here.”
Because if tens of thousands had been streamed to the mainland and into the mainland, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracing could not have been complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring expenditure would increase disproportionately by a multiple.
Rumberg consoled for next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the winter mountain festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 as well as the day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressur Olympic champion Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic winner Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the Dressur tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came on the weekend with four starts to four wins.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start with Weihegold and Quantaz respectively, she was also in the Grand Prix Special on Sunday and not to be beaten in the short.
At the 15-year-old Stute Weihegold, Werth made a special appearance on Sunday against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
Also in the short term, the Germans were clear on Saturday on Quantaz before their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is set to establish the ten-year stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first cure at all.
At the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all four important exams.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More Airports in Worms
Wormser Hochschule continues in the air: "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" founded a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and starts in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to allow the start of studies not only in the summer, but also for the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities are equally exhausted both in the university and at the aviation security academy of the DFS.
The DFS will advise the university in setting up and occupying the professorship.
Represented at the University since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students are in the Air Traffic Management program as part of their training as a pilot at the University of Worms.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and lot training significantly contributes to further increase the attractiveness of the lot profession.
“In these times, economic support is not easy for us.
However, we strongly expect that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff,” says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS at the signing of the contract.
“For the DFS, the Foundation Professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide pilots with a broad, professional knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer."
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences, said: "The Foundation Professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to link to the already existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor’s degree course Air Traffic Management”.
The trust of the German Air Safety Authority is for the University of Worm’s motivation and commitment to further develop its teaching and research expertise in the future areas of air transport.
With the first foundation professorship for a dual degree program, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students in the field of aviation of tomorrow.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, stresses: "The University of Worms, with its focus on air transport, has a unique character in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
About 30 minutes later, the motorway A 45 was completely closed in the direction of Aschaffenburg on Saturday afternoon, as after a traffic accident the rescue helicopter was in use.
A 76-year-old man drove with a Ford around 12.40 a.m. at the exit Alzenau-Mitte in the corner straight and landed on the dashboard.
The impact triggered the front airbags, the driver suffered slight injuries to the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient flew to a hospital after the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no risk of life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused a damage of about 2000 euros, had to be scrapped.
Heil wants to examine other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions back to light in parts of the meat industry.
Law enforcement is just ahead of it.
But they are right - and will they stay?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) also wants to review other industries in accordance with the now-planned strict regulations against defects in the meat industry.
“We will look at the industry for the industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary,” said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employers are already warning against restricting labour contracts in general.
After the massive Corona outbreak at the meat giant T<0xC3><0xB6>nnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet will decide on a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer employ foreign personnel in slaughtering, dispersing and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of work contracts and loan workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of employment contracts and employee leave if you do not want to completely cut off the economy".
Work contracts, for example, are the basis for their value-added to the customer for a wide range of trades, the construction industry and plant construction.
"The faults of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban labour contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Contracts are meaningful.
"If an industrial company orders a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a very normal contract of work".
The German meat industry considers a ban on labour contracts and leasing in its industry to be unconstitutional.
It is not clear why the portioning and packaging of cheeses should apply a different labour law in the future than that of sausage, according to an opinion on the bill, as reported by the "Neue Osnabr<0xC3><0xBC>cker Zeitung" (Saturday).
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would therefore rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European employees from work contracts companies worked in the industry after the results of an examination by the NRW Labour Protection Administration, part of the day, 16 hours a day.
Often they did not have a break.
Salary has been retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation at the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said a relatively strict law had entered into force for the meat industry as early as 2017.
However, through "trick-like constructions" these have been bypassed.
"Now it has to be thoroughly cleaned up".
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to decide in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that not only concern the meat industry - for example, higher rates of checks on labour protection or clear criteria for community accommodation."
This draft includes amendments to the Act on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and to the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg’s Minister of Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) believes more intensive controls are needed.
"I wish we could do even more checks in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal protection, everything possible, for example, animal transport," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more staffing is also needed for more controls.
Three dead in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
In the crash of an ultralight aircraft on a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people died, according to police.
A child is easily injured.
Two more people have been rescued from the accident, a spokesman for the Wesel district police station said.
A parachute was found at the accident site, police said.
The Rheinische Post reported on eyewitness accounts that before the crash, the plane collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were not known at first.
Clearance of Frankfurter Opernplatz runs peacefully
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the emptying of the opera house on Sunday night was also peaceful.
Most recently, a few dozen more people were standing in the square, but left him at 1 a.m. before the start of the lockdown.
The police have been in operation since the early evening with numerous officials, there was a greater police presence in the entire city area.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight on, there was a ban on the opera house where a week ago there had come to crawl.
Police officers had been attacked from the crowd with bottles.
At least five officers were injured after police raids, and several police vehicles were damaged.
The night of Saturday was also quiet.
Car crashes: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Sch<0xC3><0xB6>neberg and H<0xC3><0xBC>mme, a 21-year-old woman suffered serious injuries on Sunday at around 13.25 am.
She was taken to the Kassel Clinic.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire department was looking for potential companions.
According to police, the woman was on her way to her hometown of H<0xC3><0xBC>mme on 83 Bundesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, when her car got off the road due to an unexplained cause.
To save the unfortunate, the fire department had to cut off the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear if anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched by the conductor using a thermal imaging camera.
The drone staff from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for personal search.
However, the task forces did not find anyone among the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured person was taken to the Kassel clinic with the ambulance for further care.
Almost 50 forces of the fire brigade Hofgeismar, H<0xC3><0xBC>mme and Sch<0xC3><0xB6>neberg were on site.
The highway was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin Masters in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a series.
The team of the five-time world footballer made the club’s 36th overall Scudetto perfect with a 2-0 (1:0) on Sunday night in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before the half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which without the last long-lost ex-national player Sami Khedira joined, is no longer pushing out of place two days before the end of the Serie A season.
The Inter Milan table is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless in the first half despite optical superiority, then Ronaldo met with the last action after a free kick variant.
A play by Miralem Pjanic used the 35-year-old from the penalty area directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo also took part in the 2-0 against the now more offensive guests, after which Federico Bernardeschi (67) dusted off.
Thus, the brilliant but decisive success was assured.
In the 89th minute, only Ronaldo, who was shot at the lattice, was expected to have scored the goal goal.
“It’s complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum is changing very easily," coach Maurizio Sarri told Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Due to the defeat, the Turins had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve had a calming edge at the top of the table in the end due to the weakness of its competitors.
In the 11 games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only won five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will still be the archer king is questionable.
For as long as the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 hits on his account after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the table star Lazio Roma at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve pro Gonzalo Higua<0xC3><0xAD>n.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus is in the Champions League’s eight-finals, but on 7 August they have to compete against Olympique Lyon to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - In spite of all the fines and court rulings threatened, drivers continue to give gas in numerous illegal races on the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg roads: In the past year and the first four months of this year, police in the Southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable values for the years before, but the raiders are increasingly doing the work of the judicial authorities: In the case of the prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim, a total of 155 investigation procedures were conducted in 2018 for illegal races, a year later it was already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
The races were less about organized events, as evidenced by the Interior Ministry’s response to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers had spontaneously attacked each other or they had taken the run from the police – also this is shown as an illegal race.
Especially German men between the ages of 18 and 60 sat on the tax.
113 Penalties - 15 times in prison
Only in comparatively few cases are the raiders caught and also asked to cash out: according to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 freedom sentences have been pronounced.
However, there is no indication that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before due to the numerous tragic accidents and processes of past years and showed more often, a ministry spokesman said.
Especially popular with Rasern is the 8th motorway, where drivers stop again and again to make room for traffic and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular race track
On the A81, the police even register more races than on any other federal highway.
With a tempolith, there is an attempt to brake the razor on the particularly affected section between the tendons and tendons.
Most of the high-priced and upscale sports and luxury cars often have Swiss markings, because the drivers escape to Germany due to the high penalties for driving too fast and driving in the neighboring country for lawns.
For the SPD, the speed limit should not be reduced to a few lines: “With a general speed limit of 130 km/h, we would create this problem on motorways from the body,” says Martin Rivoir, traffic expert with the SPD Land Day Group.
"The barrier threshold for raser would be significantly higher if you weren't supposed to be legal here and there by 200 kilometers per hour and more on the road."
Rivoir says less about education or image campaigns: “Whoever in such a way violates all rules and not only puts his own life at risk, but also the lives of other road users, is hardly attainable with reason.”
ADAC calls for stronger police force to intervene
On the other hand, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that breeders cannot be deterred from the time limits", says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
It calls for additional as well as tougher controls on the affected routes.
It is not uncommon for the high-touring power fair to become more painful and serious: from January 2019 to April 2020, three people died nationwide in the races, two of them uninvolved in a nightly crash in Stuttgart’s city centre and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men were supposed to have delivered an auto race.
One of the vehicles came off the road, slammed against a garden wall and stayed on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
Twenty-one more people have been injured in the race over the past two years.
However, in the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, stricter penalties are not necessary: "Legislative need for action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races harder is not seen," the Interior Ministry said in a statement.
Blue light from July 23: Desperate burglar steals drinks from Imbiss
Rohrdorf: A man broke into an ambush on Thursday in Rohrdorf (Calw County) and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road around 3.40 a.m. and ran in the direction of the ambush.
There, he noticed a man who served himself in the refrigerator with drinks and left the entrance door through the entrance door that had previously been knocked on.
The perpetrator fled in the direction of the meadows behind the ambush.
According to police, the burglar also served at a cash desk and stole cash in the low three-digit area.
The suspect is described as follows: he is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hoodie, black pants and bright shoes.
Further testimony is received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
On the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour, cycling pro Pascal Ackermann has fought his second victory of the day.
The 26-year-old Pfalz from the Bora-hansgrohe team sat on the 109-kilometer section with start and finish in Hermannstadt in the mass sprint, having already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season three and four victories for Ackermann.
In the overall ranking, his Austrian teammate Gregor M<0xC3><0xBC>hlberger performed.
In the morning, the 26-year-old had sovereignly decided to ride the mountain and thus took over the top in the ranking.
Only 104 drivers had entered the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountaineering.
“I’m really happy to start the season with a win,” Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
“The sprint was really hectic,” said the 26-year-old.
300 meters in front of the goal, he just pulled his sprint, "and it worked perfectly."
According to the rules of the World Association of UCI, a Corona test was carried out on all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and carers were separated from the organization team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Audiences at start and finish were not allowed.
The head office gave instructions on the reanimation of the wires
D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf-Garath.
In a multi-family house, a child (4) was suddenly lifeless in the water when bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call came shortly before 1 p.m.
"A commando dispatcher immediately gave instructions on lay-out reanimation," a fire department spokesman told BILD.
The incoming rescue forces took the resurgence measures shortly after.
The child in danger of life was transported to the clinic under resuscitation.
Why it failed is unclear.
The police have routinely taken up the investigation into the accident.
The firefighter said: "We are going out of a tragic accident in the apartment".
N<0xC3><0xBC>rnberg: Unapproved Tuning Meeting - Police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily more than 1,000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police implemented their announcement to control such events in an enhanced manner.
A major tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg S<0xC3><0xBC>dstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Central Franken Police, an increase in the number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolst<0xC3><0xA4>dter Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police around 10:30 p.m.
The police then carried out a large number of vehicle checks.
It was only recently that the police had announced that they wanted to take action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meetings in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
Officials counted about 700 vehicles and about 1100 people at the top, police say.
However, only a small part of the presence of the "autoposer" and tuning scenes are assigned.
Apparently, most of the scene in question followed the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons located on the premises, it should be assumed that these were mainly schoolchildren.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection provisions, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The on-site control measures were completed at around 1 a.m.
In total, the officials identified structural changes in 10 vehicles in such a way that the operating permit had been revoked.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No auto racing
There were no illegal car races.
"The Central Franks Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on the incident and will continue to carry out enhanced control measures, including in connection with the emergence of schoolchildren," it said.
The News5 agency spoke with J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Schr<0xC3><0xB6>dinger of the involved towing company: "They have all the beautiful rims that we are not allowed to scratch", says Schr<0xC3><0xB6>dinger.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company needs to be careful not to do any damage.
"The young people should finally get their cars back unharmed".
Work agency numbers: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating, according to its own statement, around 900 suspected cases of abuse of the short-term worker's money.
“This is extremely low for more than 880,000 companies that have shown short-term work,” said Daniel Terzenbach, executive director of the Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung.
When, at the start of the Corona crisis, many companies had asked for short-term work, the BA had to respond quickly.
Usually, the test takes up to three weeks.
“So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
All the more closely we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there'll be a lot more to come.
We are not naive and have a long breath.”
Indications of abuse often come from the employees or unions concerned.
In addition, the BA analysis software is used to detect patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
“Are there going to be more insolvencies than last year?
The estimates are different, but we are arming ourselves for the case and are already training our employees in the work agencies for processing applications for insolvency payments.”
The numbers are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The assembly was dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the rowers of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation said on PNN's request.
The kids would have left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow was cleared by rowers, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the Foundation there are always gatherings in which the distance and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 bypass regulation are not complied with.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a corona regulation, the parks will be closed in the event of darkening.
The storage on the meadows is prohibited according to parking regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The Foundation has long complained that visitors would leave more and more trash behind and destroy protected biotope.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide district of Neuk<0xC3><0xB6>lln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a coronavirus outbreak in the popular tourist resort of St. Wolfgang in Upper Austria.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as state authorities in Linz reported.
There were more than 100 results in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected young interns are in tourism companies, but also at least one holiday guest has been tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The closing time was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there and there" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Also, individual guests must have left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of guests are German.
By Friday, the first infections had become publicly known.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the interns who had celebrated in several localities and might have been stuck there.
“We all like to do this in our youth,” he told the radio station <0xC3><0x96>1.
However, on Friday, two bars were closed to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees about the dangers of Covid-19.
Since Saturday, hundreds of employees, vacationers and locals have been tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The eruption evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of the spread of the coronavirus throughout Europe during the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1,500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The main focus of the new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for the Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
On the last day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured the third place in the table by a 2-0 (0:0) victory against their direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League because FC Chelsea still passed and qualified for fourth place in the Premier League.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United were led by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the post-game period, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) reached the final.
Chelsea, in the Champions League eight final against FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
“That means a lot to me,” said coach Frank Lampard, who also stands against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach in the FA Cup final.
Tottenham Hotspur also took advantage of Chelsea's victory over Wolverhampton, who made it to the Wolves with a 1–1 (1:0) margin at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa opted for the Fernduell with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth for themselves, but West Ham United had a long history of winning the class.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) equaled Andrej Jarmolenko (85th) immediately.
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) to Arsenal.
The club, which shot three coaches in the season, is down after five first league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could no longer save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
FC Liverpool, who has been England's champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Klopp barely missed the record in English football with his team.
The best brand holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
Following Newcastle's lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said Torsch<0xC3><0xBC>tte van Dijk after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
In the end, the Premier League bosses should be satisfied.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England had been interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there has even been a discussion about an early cancellation or release of the remaining games on neutral ground.
After all, the season could end without special events – but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Netanyahu’s government are becoming more and more violent.
During the night, violent clashes took place.
Israeli police carried out a violent demonstration against the right-wing government leader Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday night in Jerusalem.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
The police used, among other things, water throwers to dissolve the announcement.
In total, according to media reports on Saturday evening, some 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu’s office.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu’s handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew in horns, and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of a counter-demonstration that supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site “ynet” reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv for allegedly spraying pepper spray from a driving car on protesters on the outskirts of the city.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The protester was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The announcements accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu has also been criticised for his handling of the Corona crisis.
It is maintained, among other things, premature loosenings and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The Corona crisis has made the economy of the country difficult.
Last year, the unemployment rate was more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has finally risen to an ever-new record.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter forces on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - An ascent accident on Saturday afternoon on the B58 at Ahlen claimed nine minor injuries.
A car driver was traveling with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police: "Probably she had suddenly braked because she wanted to turn back."
This must have been seen by the driver of a Mercedes transporter driving behind her, probably too late.
He leaned back on the car.
In the accident, three inmates in the car and six in the transporter were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea rules border city after Corona case of suspected
So far, North Korea has seen a “illuminating success” in its own measures to defend the coronavirus.
Now the country reports for the first time about a suspected case.
Due to a first official coronavirus case in the country, North Korea has completely shut down a big city out of fear of a disaster.
Despite the strongest epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, “the malicious virus could have been smuggled into the country,” state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the state of emergency had been imposed.
The Communist leadership called for the highest level of alarm.
Should the suspected case be confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the country shot down.
So far, North Korea has not registered a single infection and has described its defenses as a “lightening success.”
The information was questioned abroad.
The symptoms of the disease have reportedly been identified in a "disruptive" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person settled in South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation of the crossing of the border within the four kilometers wide and mostly still mined military buffer zone from South Korea.
South Korea’s military, however, reportedly allowed the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high, according to the national news agency Yonhap.
There have been investigations into some people.
North Korea called an emergency meeting of the Workers’ Party’s Politburo, chaired by Kim Jong Un, on Saturday, according to its own information.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim has already ordered Friday as a preventative measure, “to completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others,” it said.
The affected person and all the people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her had been quarantined.
The party's central military commission is therefore to investigate the "disruption" as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
In Kaesong, an estimated 300,000 people live.
Tensions before the Council session: City-East and noise protection are still before a big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the committee will also vote on the building plan for the large-scale urban development-East project", says it more casually in the middle of the city press release for the next municipal meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of the Congress.
In particular, however, the appreciation of the eastern city is controversial until the end.
The majority of them are scarce, most recently in individual committees, even rejecting them depending on their presence.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), which emerged from the citizenship and then developed by the administration and municipal council not to fail after almost ten years of preparation now, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as "out-of-parliamentary opposition".
“Everyone thinks they know better,” said Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim civic list.
In fact, after reading the contracts in this position, he was: "I know what I'm talking about".
The exit will be cheaper for the city, the Technical Town Hall is opposed to the city administration’s claims of grants, which are convinced of their existence small, to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop in a very different way from what is predicted in the town hall and on the part of economic advocates.
To shape the city by its own power and not an investor: that is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
Essentially, it also provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schlo<0xC3><0x9F>berg, the rental of the ex-Thale for administrative areas and a smaller downtown redesign, ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
For example, the municipal council will vote on the noise plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheimer population from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many temporary reductions.
In a press release, the local Transport Club of Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to be done because they have neglected the bus traffic with diluted beats and have been so committed to the car with little commitment to the raison d’<0xC3><0xAA>tre.
The municipal council also agrees on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, it is on the agenda of accession to the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg Climate Protection Pact, the re-establishment of parental contributions in the urban children’s day care facilities and the application for admission to the Smart City promotion of the Federal Government.
Citizens are welcome, but we need to take Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann to start the new season with a lot of delay
With almost a half-year delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season at the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of super sports cars can take up the regular operation, the first test drives were now on.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 in more detail.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first mission in Grasser Racing’s new Lamborghini Huracan.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargen turned his first lap on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in the GT3 car.
“There are already a few things that are different than the Porsche from the previous season,” Zimmermann says.
"With ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it really was a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT-Sport, the Dutchman has been able to help his new teammate in many ways.
“I’m not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings new challenges,” Zimmermann says.
"Steijn and I understand each other blindly and we have made tremendous progress at the Lausitz ring from session to session as well."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also broadcast its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newcomers, knows the route.
In 2015 he was the last guest in the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I had to get used to the track a little bit," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen race team Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you need to hit optimally to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is, that turns out in two weeks.
“Of course, the teams play a little bit of poker in the tests,” he says.
"Finally, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a busy calendar.
There are seven races until the beginning of November.
Current stand is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the N<0xC3><0xBC>rburgring, former Formula 1 driver Niko H<0xC3><0xBC>lkenberg will enter the GT wheel.
British Minister of Transport of Quarantine Decision Coldly Captured
The British government’s decision to quarantine Spain’s holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has, according to news reports, caught the country’s transport minister cold.
Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues decided to take the measure at home on Saturday.
Due to the rising corona numbers in Spain, the London office is striking the country from the list of countries from which it is possible to enter without quarantine.
The new rule applies from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are just on holiday on the day of the holiday, only from Saturday, August 1st, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is still considered one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"Many ministers are expected to have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," said Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has made the effort to notify Grant Shapps".
Almost a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict exit barriers, the number of infections in the country rises again.
Virologists are primarily responsible for the night life for the new spread.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries in the UK.
Unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland is currently being advised by the British government, which is particularly popular with British holidaymakers, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded in Spain.
Russia: Day of the Navy: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced on the day of the Navy in his country the equipment of the warships with the most modern hypersonic weapons.
With these unique weapons in the world, the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
According to Interfax, the Ministry of Defense also informed the agency about successful tests of the hypersonic missile Zircon built for the navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the sound speed of about 343 meters per second.
They are the weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo is further built
Poseidon, the nuclear-capable underwater torpedo, will continue to be built.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself also rode a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service at the individual fleet associations of the largest country on Earth.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been protecting Russia reliably, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Also in many other Russian coastal towns, the naval forces began the day of the navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside the powerful Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a gunfight in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired there.
In a video released by the Ministry of Defense, not only warships, including a submarine, but also fighter helicopters and jets were visible.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: aid made difficult due to Corona
Washington – The first hurricane of this year’s season over the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds, and heavy rainfall were now threatening parts of the U.S. state, the U.S. National Hurricane Center’s NOAA said on Sunday night.
Governor Greg Abbott called for the state of emergency for many districts.
The corona pandemic in Texas is making the work of helpers more difficult, Abbott said.
Evacuated to be careful
“Every hurricane is a huge challenge,” Abbott told the Houston Chronicle.
Looking at the Texas vortex, he added, "This challenge is complicated and will still be exacerbated when you consider that it sweeps through an area that is the state's most heavily affected area of Covid-19."
According to Johns-Hopkins University, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
They should not miss out on practices that "we've gotten used to", such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to the CBS channel.
It is important that everyone stay away.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, the corona should be tested in emergency accommodation.
Damage was initially only reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning rescinded
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" had hit the island of Padre Island on land, according to authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been elevated to the lowest level of the hurricane.
A storm warning had been issued for the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent and was later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening, while "Hanna" continued to move into the interior of the country and steer to northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was on its way to Hawaii at night on Sunday at wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour.
The hurricane center, however, expected him to continue to weaken.
According to the forecast, it is expected to be on Sunday (local time) near the largest islands of Hawaii - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic this year, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season after a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could become very strong vortex storms, the agency said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, which is an average of only 10 percent, it said at the time.
U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government closely monitors the storms and is in touch with the affected states.
Four gates unknown: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic was not recognized for two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals unknown: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a black evening at 0:2 (0:1) at SSC Naples in Italian football league Serie A - and was really angry at the video assistants of the referee.
"A festival not given gates for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR gone so hard against a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Host Naples had taken the lead through a gate by outside defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic first cheered the match.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) picked up the hit due to a remote position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - the VAR intervened again.
Also the goals of attackers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) were taken back by the referee team, according to the VAR.
In the post-game period, Allan made the 2-0 final for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology provides records,” writes the “Gazzetta dello Sport”.
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League started for Double-winner FC Bayern with a setback.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defence after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who is behind Captain Manuel Neuer and Middle Field Chief Joshua Kimmich for the third most time, suffers a band injury at the left foot and threatens to miss out on crucial king-class duels.
In Munich’s Schmuddelwetter, the right-back broke off a training game and was driven off the pitch with a golf card.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A return to the eight-final game against FC Chelsea on 8 August is unlikely to be possible, the 24-year-old is expected to hope for the final tournament starting on 12 August in Lisbon.
But the Bavarians do not want to be stopped by the lack of training on Sunday.
Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on his way to Portugal’s capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are expected to show his winning title collectors in the next 28 days, ideally, until the King's Class Final on August 23.
"We have mastered the mandatory tasks with championship and cup just excellently.
Now we have to create the special thing,” Flick said.
Until the Munichers can deal specifically with the final tournament and previously a training camp on the Algarve, but for the first time, the eight-final duty against FC Chelsea is on.
After the 3-0 draw before the Corona break, the Londoners in the domestic arena should not become the Bavarian nightmare again, as they did in the lost 2012 Finale dahoam.
“We have to go through the door first.
“We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game,” Flick said.
A vote test will be held against Olympique Marseille on Friday.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had been on vacation after the Double 13 days, on a one-time August.
He welcomed 31 players on S<0xC3><0xA4>bener Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, including the new players for the noble purchase of Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
“Leroy has fit in well, like all the new ones,” Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. is no longer allowed to train, Flick spoke much better about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, team strength is now being trained for the Londoners, who are in contrast to the flick ensemble in the rhythm of the game.
After that, the Munichers could expect a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon “is not so easy,” said the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
Klose and Flick, the World Record Shooter, know of some common tournament preparation, which is particularly relevant in the 0-on-100 match.
Working with his current team is "a pleasure", Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive feature of his team.
The tournament with nine teams was also ambitious on Sunday as well.
Among the performers were all involved, including the reprehensible Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay beyond the king-class season is not secured.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to elect its world champion
Because it cannot be driven on the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise in order to award the World Cup titles.
All American races have been cancelled.
The race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more races were added to the ten Grand Prix so far confirmed during the week.
In October, the N<0xC3><0xBC>rburgring will be held in Germany and Portim<0xC3><0xA3>o in Portugal.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. fight for World Cup points on the Italian tradition circuit in Imola.
This includes 13 races in the 2020 race calendar according to the current standings.
“We are delighted that we continue to make great progress on the completion of our plans for the 2020 season,” said Formula 1 boss Chase Carey.
In total, 15 to 18 races in the king class of motorsport will be held in this exceptional season.
Formula One will finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Prior to the officially scheduled races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports say there could still be performances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Rules require races on three continents
However, the Formula 1 regulations require at least races on three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents will be driven, there is supposed to be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles in reference to "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the looming coronavirus crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Abandonment is critical in Brazil
Due to the tense Corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil.
“We look forward to being with them again next season,” Carey said.
The cancellation of the American races was particularly critical in Brazil: “The cancellation came not surprising to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it,” said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
Thus, the infection rates in the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo area are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would also not justify a cancellation.
Be prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad view against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert’s famous late-night show via video chat and told in an interview what she had in mind during her meeting with Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest at a popular U.S. late-night show via video switches.
She spoke, among other things, of her struggle against the Powers of the World.
Also about her famous "bad look" at her meeting with Donald Trump, the teenager spoke.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg drew attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latenight show about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday into your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish.
In doing so, she spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world’s powerful.
“There are some things that surprised me,” she said.
“How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis,” she said.
“Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children are going to the streets,” she said.
State leaders and leading politicians who mock or even try to silence them on social media find it “funny” because they show her the reactions “because they have no other answer.”
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was approached to a well-known scene in which she cast a bitter look behind U.S. President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip produced a GIF, an animated image that eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think of the U.S. president at the time?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open-ended question, she answered only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I think that requires no further explanation."
With the final answer, the experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected and disappeared briefly laughing from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Real Estate with Three Pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race for Europe’s Golden Shoe with Bayern’s Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile still has the best chances to become the goalkeeper king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional managed three hits in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two converted eleven meters in the postseason of both halves.
The 30-year-old from the table four has now 34 seasons on his account before the end of the season - just as many achieved Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern M<0xC3><0xBC>nchen in the last season of the Bundesliga.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo followed with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met the top rider in the evening at Sampdoria Genoa.

Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members shared an official statement on Saturday, another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" to all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The life of the musician ("The End of the Game", "In The Skies") was like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there must have been controversy because Green wanted to donate all of the group’s profits for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in wide robes and with great crucifix.
Mental health problems should also have played a role.
Three years after its founding, Green left the band in 1970.
There followed a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffers from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the screen.
He is said to have lived temporarily on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working-class family in the Bethnal Green district of London.
At a young age, he was enthusiastic about American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing professional guitar and five years later got the chance to stand as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners on stage.
Shortly thereafter, he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton in the Bluesbreakers.
In the midst of the Blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967, along with fellow bluesbreakers Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green provided the group with the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed his shadow sides: Green did not force the media space, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
He later commented in an interview: “The worst thing that has happened to me in life is the drugs – the best thing was to land a number one hit.”
Towards the end of the decade, Green achieved a surprising success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, swims without him in new formation on a successful wave.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several minor solo successes, Green failed to make a major comeback until he re-started in 1996 with a group of friends.
The British "Daily Telegraph" at the time spoke of a rock star returning to Earth.
Free of drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend in his lifetime – and with his soft sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
