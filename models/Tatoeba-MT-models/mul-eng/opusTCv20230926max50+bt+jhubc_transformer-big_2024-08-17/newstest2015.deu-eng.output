Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India’s new Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been meeting his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko on his first major foreign visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the world’s third-largest economic nation.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the very top of the agenda.
According to reports, India is also hoping for a defence cooperation agreement between the two nations.
Karratha police arrest 20-year-old man after fast motorcycle chase
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after observing it as it left a petrol station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signs and continued to drive on Burgess Road before turning back to the bushland, where officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who corresponded to the description of the driver were later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police accuse a 20-year-old man of not observing a stop signal as well as reckless driving.
He is scheduled to appear before the court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was secured and seized for three months.
George Webster Accused of Hotel Rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was heard at a hearing by the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "conscious, asleep, and could not signal consent."
Webster is also charged with raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the trial date for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Reflection on the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congress MPs Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as civil rights.
“Like unions, middle-class jobs also die,” said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I am proud to introduce the Employee Authorization Act together with John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on the basis of the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination – and thus stops anti-union forces.
Complementing the national labour law to create an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organize a trade union representation, to sue before a civil court for justice - and to receive compensation or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative – at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks the unions have been exposed to in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country – Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and uphold labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right of association in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his staff encouraged the country to pass a constitution that would ensure that the militarized autocratic Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness that the workers and their unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that “the rights of the workers to union and joint negotiations and actions are guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves, and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans introduced a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve the working and economic conditions and to guarantee to each and every individual.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to narrow it are null and void; measures aimed at it are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, from which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drafted, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors put forward a guarantee that "everyone has the right to defend his or her rights to the rights of others."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
As this country advises other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to form a trade union - and that this trade union should then be protected in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - should be protected.
After these rights in America have been shot down, it is actually very wise to reassess the American ideal, which means that the working population must have the right to unite and become a part of a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers’ movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representatives - has long been superfluous.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that have made America great in the past and unlocking the promise of democracy.
Judge Temporarily Stops Law That Could Force All Abortion Clinics in Louisiana to Close
A U.S. federal judge provisionally stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana on Sunday, which lawyers say would have likely led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was brought into law by Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana in June and is due to come into force on Sept. 1, would force doctors carrying out abortions to acquire a patient admission right at a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors can temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions while applying for such a right.
“The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law as they strive to achieve these rights,” wrote federal judge John deGravelles in his ruling.
Within one month, a hearing will be set up for the judge to make a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, and said doctors are giving so much more time to get hospitalization rights.
“Today’s decision means that women in Louisiana are avoiding a hideous law that wants to take away their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who has sued three of the state’s five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi to be unconstitutional.
Key locations of a Texas law that would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that the right of introduction by doctors requires unnecessary restrictions.
Opponents of abortion are opposed to the fact that the measures serve to protect the health of women, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient admission rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to no longer perform abortions, this doctor for fear of his safety would no longer perform the operation, the group said.
In their argument against the verdict, representatives of the state of Louisiana said they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions, while their applications for patient admission rights would still be pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute online for their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data from more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
SMALL STUDIES: New drugs could slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman’s age at diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-existing diseases as well as social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer had already progressed further at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.
“This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are usually found in larger cities,” she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedical services to counter the distances, she suggested as a possible remedy a strengthening of the service of flight doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said the study, regardless of geographic status, resulted in poor long-term survival rates in women with ovarian cancer and underscored the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden Centers Regret Declining House Owners
The decline along with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35 could result in garden centers losing tens of thousands of pounds a year if today’s young consumers reach the “core group for garden products” according to a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount people with a home spend for their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting gardens for park purposes, and the declining size of the garden are further factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion a year is put on sale.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent over a 6-year period, the lowest spending on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot pull plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for the RHS, said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with them on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail trade due to rising house ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also forecast an improved market situation for this year due to the better weather according to unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1,000 protesters stormed the state-run PTV television station.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters back out of PTV buildings.
The transmitter set up its operation for about 40 minutes, but is now broadcasting again.
At the same time, around 3,000 protesters tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometer away, they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped with collisions with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif’s resignation, but he refused.
The country’s army, meanwhile, calls for a political solution to the conflict, “without wasting time and without using force.”
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already cleaned up more often.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in last May’s parliamentary election.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to push for Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders U.S. diplomat for spying report
Turkey’s foreign ministry has ordered the country’s top U.S. diplomats for information on a report on U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister B<0xC3><0xBC>lent said the U.S. Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former U.S. analyst for the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that also the main intelligence service of Germany, Ankara, was on the lookout, made the Turkish government’s reactions much more appalled.
WARNING: Lokfuhrer threatens with consequences for commuter
The German-wide warning strike by the Lokf<0xC3><0xBC>hrer on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The stand, announced for 18 to 21 hours, covers all transport companies nationwide, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

said the district chairman of the trade union of German locomotive drivers (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf.
We expect to see significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so it is difficult to predict the consequences concretely.
Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca with evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0>.
The chief of police of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> on the island of Mallorca was arrested on corruption charges by businessmen and bartenders in the infamous binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested on corruption charges against him by several Punta Ballena businessmen, the street where most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> to the office of the prosecutor for the fight against corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are questioned together with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners stated that the government’s vetting economy has a serious impact on their businesses.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about surviving," one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our base of life out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing on 24 men during a Fellatio fragrance tour.
The island authorities have since attempted to stop the improper behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants on the infamous alcohol-drinking pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour organizer Carnage jointly had to pay a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist town of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British tourists, is also known for several alcohol-influenced accidents, including the trend of "balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FR<0xC3><0x9C>HLING has given South Australia a wintery surprise, with fierce thunderstorms and strong winds that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m., another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen at night to Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a gusset that started just before 8 p.m. and caused almost 4mm of rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week provided an early spring dose, temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a high of only 15.8<0xC2><0xB0>C.
The fluctuating weather conditions have likely led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft was supposed to land shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a shear wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
Wind gusts reached at this time about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to launch during a second landing and finally set off at about 20.40 hours.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of several other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16<0xC2><0xB0>C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthews says it's high time for big networking
In the face of the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into a high-tech switchgear, our columnist Bernd Matthies relies on an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my gaze falls on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But there’s a thought behind it: if the cable wasn’t there, all listeners would be flying around the house in no time at all, and that would be significantly more retro.
Is this true of the eeltronic?
No, typographical error: electronic) sector the rule that today's world novelty is tomorrow's electric scrap, bought - obsolete.
And who, for example, still has a tube TV in the living room today, says only that he basically rejects television.
Why these reflections?
Because the urge of the Ifa at the radio tower this week once again brings us to the forefront of our absolute incompetence in electronics issues.
The layman, who used to blindly master the washing machine and CD player, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread with unfathomably simple expert speech in front of him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press station.
Yeah, is it still going on?
What should we talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such quarks?
In fact, for about 20 years, it has been mainly about the fact that we are most pleased to network our house.
So that the yoghurt itself reorders, so that the fire alarm informs us during the holiday on the Maldives that it burns gradually in the working room.
And wouldn’t it be wonderful if we arrived soon from the office from the air conditioning...?
However, this requires an air conditioning system.
But a dream will come true soon enough: We raise our wristwatch, say to her, "Suction!" - and at home the vacuum cleaner runs away.
Irresistible.
Everything is running on nothing less than a revolution: “The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurring,” says one industry expert, you can connect the washing machine to a headphones, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza stays in the oven, but we don’t need anything.
We also know from daily practice that if a new-fashioned device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday after spending the summer in air defenses, while rocket and mortar shelling on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas fell and the schools in Gaza shut down and the schools shut down.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in the south of Israel drawn by rocket launchers, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, a staff member of the "Pashosh" Kindergarten, hit by a rocket, was removed from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit weird" to suddenly go back to school.
“These were difficult times, and we didn’t leave the house at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke out last week, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move farther away from Gaza in safer areas and avoid rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border city in Gaza, which is heavily drawn from the Palestinian shooting.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Last Tuesday, Israel and Hamas agreed to an unrestricted cease-fire.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting; however, major problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas’ demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza’s air and seaports.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the handing over of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel disputes this information and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during fighting in Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and around 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fighting continues, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
“I hope the school will be reopened soon so that we can continue to learn, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl questions NPD ban procedures
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvise Thomas Strobl has pronounced an end to the ongoing NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing ban proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is cutting worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU head of state in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a joyful development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD almost failed in the five-percent hurdle at the vote on Sunday.
A first call for a ban on the far-right party failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection at the time also had informants in the NPD.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after long preparation.
The federal government and the Bundestag did not agree.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
In the Neulander square, refugees are now housed in tents.
The first reception centre for refugees in Harburg is open from all sides.
Now the internal authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross next to them.
The district politicians were only informed a short time ago - they are not very enthusiastic.
“These Hauruck actions further undermine citizens’ reservations and give district politicians no way to contribute constructively to the humane housing of refugees,” says Britta Herrmann, Group Chair of the Greens at the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party demands that the district administration of Harburg provide currently unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the first shot are the storm of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities are not able to provide enough space in follow-up facilities.
Therefore, many refugees stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have seen the strongest winter increase in seven years, a widely observed index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is at 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
Tim Lawless, head of research at RP Data, said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-tiered market.
The figures from RP Data show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices rose by just 1.4 percent year-over-year.
Mr Lawless went on to say that with the start of spring, there would be an increase in properties for sale in the coming months, which would subject the market to "a real test".
“If you look at the consistently high auction price, a generally fast sales rate, and the consistently low interest rate environment, it’s likely that home prices will continue to rise over the next three months,” he said.
In a statement to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of CEO Peer Medau and attests to this to pose "like a field man".
This is not the style of the university, the statement said.
The Medau family had already been informed by the middle of June about the university’s intentions.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July is definitely wrong," P<0xC3><0xB6>tzl said.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "forecasts or even decisions", but there were "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle necessary for access is also less dramatic than feared by the Medes.
Of a nine-meter wide road was and is not the talk.
It is at the current level of 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," P<0xC3><0xB6>tzl explains.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future, does not want P<0xC3><0xB6>tzl to apply.
Train parking is not at all possible because, as with other public parking spaces, this can now be solved intelligently.
Think of the residents
The children's crib Bergwichtel, which is located on the site and in front of its front door would lead the access to the parking deck, is supposed to "not be affected" according to the university president.
Rather, he points out that "this is not only about the children's crib, but also about the residents at the entrance to Friedrich-Streib-Straib-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e and the 800 students of the neighbouring Realschule.
So it’s much more than Mr. Medau’s particular interests,” says P<0xC3><0xB6>tzl.
Whether the criticism of the parent's advice of the children's crib, with the expansion of the road would be justified by a "lost few naturally-deprived spots of Coburg", "the reader can decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, P<0xC3><0xB6>tzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Office, wants to inform the city councils about the construction development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau last week informed the parents of the kindergarten about the plans of the university.
Accordingly, the access to the new park deck should lead not via the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Straib-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, but over the Medau-Berg.
Thus, the narrow road would have to be expanded two-lane along about a kilometer.
According to high calculations by the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would tenfold.
There are about 2000 vehicles per day.
On the part of the city, we did not want to talk about the project so far.
Glandorf withdraws from Handball national team
Holger Glanddorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt led to this decision mainly health problems.
I didn't like the decision, it's matured over several months.
It’s time for me to listen to my body’s signals and end my career in the national team,” the 2007 World Champion said on his Facebook page.
He thus goes into international retirement with a record of 167 country games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because he wants to go on a tore hunt for the Champions League winner from Flensburg for a few more years, he is no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announced his squad for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf held a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have fascinated me just as much as they will excite my long-time co-players and my successors.
But for my club, I want to be healthy in the next few years, for this, longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which do not allow the current double load.
The left-hander had even had to worry about his career ending in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which later caused a severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other operations followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team careers do not pass without a trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot surgeries that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never got my blood pressure right.
Here are some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year I noticed that although I can control my head, but my body cannot be fooled,” Glandorf told Handball Time magazine in an interview.
He would only be available for a comeback in case of an emergency.
“When all the stitches are torn, I’m always ready to talk,” the two-time family father told the magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I must also say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least a little straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League win, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he secured the European Cup Winners' Cup with Flensburg.
German economy shrinks by 0.2 percent in the spring
The crises around the globe have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 per cent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was shared by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed provisional calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual growth rate for the first half of the year, a total GDP increase of 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and destination of the "M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterland-Mooiste", which first led through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
The castle town of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organised the so-called "M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterland Mooiste".
This is the largest cycling tour across M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour of the M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterland.
Written out in various trade journals, this tour was offered to interested parties.
We come from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterland in this way as well”, the cyclists enjoyed the route through the districts Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration at the Association of the Schutzenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
Further, the route, which was advertised for three different categories, led towards Herrenholz via the Sch<0xC3><0xB6>ppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Bilerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, cyclists proved their good condition.
They were served on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organiser Jos ter Huerne and Deputy Mayor Heinz L<0xC3><0xB6>lfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a beautiful experience for all involved.
The organization ran without problems and there were no negative incidents,” Heinz L<0xC3><0xB6>lfing draws a positive conclusion from this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
“We will see each other again in 2015 in hopefully beautiful weather on August 30th or during another weekend,” the cyclists promised to return to M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterland and the organisers plan a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's Unbearably Honest Memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which led Konstantin Waker, song maker, pacifist, police-safe activist, ex-prisoner, to paper in "Monk and Warrior" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought fats for thought fats, the Municher, born on June 1, 1947, wrote down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable lyrics.
And he is ruthlessly honest: From the Onania as a high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he does not leave any human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow humans.
Broad space also takes up abstract but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of which he tries to go to the ground, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment – and also how not only the music has shaped him (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Waker closer to the ascetic monk, who is created "by subtraction", as he says, "by letting go of all the unnecessary".
Among all the high-spirited views, however, there are also short anecdotes about the earth: for example, about slaughterhouses in a local frequented by GIs or a crazy drive, where he pointed a tree in front.
He is also ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, Midlands, in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry auditions for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Stop the crash.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton – who were already grown up when I was a child – went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket beat.
I never had such a conversation with him.
For most of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father's time, he gained an insight into what life might have been like for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smoky, deep-smoky labyrinths with flames and smoke and lots of rust.
My father used to just put himself in the tub and then he could be heard slowly as he began to sing because he could wash the foundry off of himself.
As I walked around, I realized that he had been doing it for years to bring food to the table, and my respect for him grew.
Henry grew up as a child without the love of his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said, "I love you."
It wasn’t until my mother was sick towards the end of her life that we started saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Did you ever stop with the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me! Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry’s career change may show up in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he has been accepted by the theatre.
It followed The Comedy of Mistakes, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started at the age of 16 when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was for quite a long time the only black imitator/comedian on television."
He learned in the profession.
I not only had to grow up in front of the public, but also learned from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke story machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager owned the stage rights to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people “painted black,” Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a peculiar, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this “year-long award-winning light pillar of British television” was also a “great parody of black people.”
By introducing characters who ridiculed and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked in the eighties on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series, and film roles marked his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just bringing in the time or stepping in a bit."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and kept him mostly for a middle-class domain, white in pantyhose and a cabbage head in front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the documentary, and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do it.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right.
“That’s why it’s a serious matter, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn’t happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of illusions.
All of a sudden I was in the National Theatre and I couldn’t believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me, 'You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they repair the computer.'
Instead, the stage manager announced that the performance continued as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave that to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, this strengthens the tendons.
That was also a good thing, so it's like a big shield of the gods telling me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a DONNER’S VOICE.
So I'm staying.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
Henry, however, still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has gone through humorous outbursts while imitating people over and over again.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of instant satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you are always looking for it, you are driving in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in the Apollo if I want to, but overall I don’t have as much as before.
I ask him if he will ever make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey – I don’t think I’d ever want to give that up again.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that’s great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen’s capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthi have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a spokesman for the Huthi party "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reported a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called on the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened, according to the paper, with a further escalation of the conflict, his demands should not be met.
The Shiite Huthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and are demanding the resignation of the government.
The Huthi tribe has been occupying the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there are always bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to contain "spirited employees"
Kenya has started to biometrically register all government officials in order to delete “spirit employees” from the government payrolls.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salary payments even after their resignation from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised at his 2013 inauguration to fight corruption in the public service.
A review earlier this year found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) per month of payments for “spirited employees” and other abusive financial practices were lost.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports to the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations is recorded, a government message said.
Anyone who did not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the message continued.
"This procedure will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also adjusting the payroll at both levels of government - so the "spirit employees" will be eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary for the Ministry of Planning.
The scandal surrounding art consultant Helge Achenbach will be discussed in court for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, in a civil trial at the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf Regional Court demand 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies that are in insolvency proceedings.
This was reported by a court spokeswoman on Monday.
According to the complaint, Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and antiques and Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach bought valuables for 121 million euros for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He served 44 years in school, 23 of whom were school principals.
From this time on, Manfred Richter knows many of the professed Petershausens and Kollbachers from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his desire to see people in the pupil.
The snow cup is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordb<0xC3><0xB6>hmen, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were sacked.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
So he killed judges in the Upper Frankish lower village.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
Manfred Richter had to run six times a week to the next station, take the train to Bamberg, go three kilometers across the city to school and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a sleeping opportunity in a red cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory.
In 1951 he made the first and in 1954 after three years of teaching assistants the second state examination.
Since Oberfranken did not have a free teaching position for him, he applied to Oberbayern and arrived at the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Fr<0xC3><0xA4>ulein-Zimmer" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958, he rented a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school in Kollbach had been dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach School Association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were summarised in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in place.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to acquire the present building from September 1982, which was expanded in 1997 after Judge's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig G<0xC3><0xB6>tz, who additionally built a workshop at the expense of the municipality and at the extension of the 1997 basement, although this was not eligible according to the guidelines for school buildings.
"Citizen G<0xC3><0xB6>tz was very school-friendly," Judge recalled gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a report by a school council on justice and justice: “You must never forget love.” Manfred Richter re-evaluated what he had heard there as a young teacher.
“You have to give the children two things: roots and wings,” the 84-year-old said.
And he had to learn, "It doesn't always work." Whether he means only his students or his own six children is not entirely clear.
In any case, Judges' actions were sometimes unconventional.
When the students were struggling, they did not receive any criminal work from him and were not forced to sit down.
At the expense of the community, Judges had bought two pairs of boxing gloves and let the two contractors compete against each other, even if there were to be a wig.
In the interest of the school, as rector, the judge maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig G<0xC3><0xB6>tz (CSU).
After his retirement, he moved the impartial judge to run for the city council at least as a last on the CSU list in 1996.
However, Judge was selected in sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists place stops in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this in itself is nothing special.
On Friday, however, only the number of people left was impressive: the 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour together with the accompanying Tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Wide and celebrate on newly discovered roads between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants had met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and there a concert of Van Baker & Band took place.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, the 60 km over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started the bike in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-D<0xC3><0xB6>ring.
For the refreshment of body and spirit, all sorts of good things had been prepared: The peasant women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, swiss, strawberry and cheesecakes, which made the skilled cyclists wonderful.
"Such cakes can only bake peasant women," one participant from Aulendiebach praised, while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be made at the drinking stand of the Gei<0xC3><0x9F>-Nidda Turnverein.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and garnered enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He earned it, finally he has re-attached the already skipped bike chains today."
Meanwhile, the mayor and the chief operating officer still had to work: they were interviewed at the fountain in front of reporter Rainer Janke’s pub and used the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Promotion manager Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004 as tour leader, was also able to sniff for a short time, but he had a lot to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated via three phones and a radio device with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle staff of the Hessen police, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
“Most of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area,” he said, “but also from Giessen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants is directed a bit to the available overnight capacities.
In category I, the participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
From the resort, the cyclists had a good impression when they broke up again after an hour and a half: "Shoot!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they said goodbye.
After arriving in Schotten, the group was allowed to take a short snorkeling break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had a nice festive atmosphere and of course, they had prepared delicacies, such as flame cakes with well-cooled spring whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Ho<0xC3><0x9F>feld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as board member of the ADAC Hessen-Th<0xC3><0xBC>ringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly delighted by the "many operations in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move freely in the open air has been eagerly used despite the sporty action on the bike.
Among the guests, there was a growing mix of citizens who were affected by the good mood as much as the great crowd of cyclists.
On the second day for the cyclists, the stations Birstein, W<0xC3><0xA4>chtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the trench forests - were on the programme.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for “conspiracy” against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government,” local media agencies say.
The police did not make any direct comment.
Among the arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized criminal association and calling phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) described their actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist cleric Fethullah G<0xC3><0xBC>llen against him and other people in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge joint Ukrainian people’s front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, headmaster of the school in Slavyansk, who visits Jazenyuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally reign here again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their later life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
She meets with a proud celebrity from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
She has her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting firm Bain and Co., whereupon she switched to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She served for seven years as CEO of the Financial Times and resigned when Pearson’s parent company’s top position went to a younger male colleague.
Their settlement was allegedly nearly <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Their political rankings are solid, too.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he sought more private business knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory council member.
As early as May, I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned glass.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inside the first guard of the BBC’s own management hierarchy, but also outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopoly, which requires a complete comprehensive reform.
But what new incoming chairman would risk running for office, running for office, and messing up an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps setting himself up for his job.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that wasn’t enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC shrink – power, money and status overwhelm.
As competition draws closer and new technologies threaten old, convenient security, the upcoming negotiation of licence fees for the BBC is associated with particular dangers.
For the modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 per year, the British public is certainly buying into the world’s largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households, and each of them costs only 40 pence a day.
And apparently the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support them today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone these days and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry, from Texas, says tweeter was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a derogatory remark about the Democratic District Attorney who is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of power.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perrys user account that denied the previous one.
Just a tweet was sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I don't cheapen the tweet and deleted it," it said in the later message.
Perry staff did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Although Perry’s tweets were released to the official user account, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the previous tweet, an unfavorable picture was drawn of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted in April 2013 for drunk driving.
Perry filed a veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to step down, leading to an indictment against Perry — who might be a 2016 presidential candidate — before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The tweet's text reads, "I don't always drive drunk with the triple-permissible alcohol level... but if I do, I'll complain to Governor Perry if he spits it out."
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg’s office was not entrusted with the management over the Grand Jury’s investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special counsel from San Antonio, who was elected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the prosecution a political trick.
His high-class team of law-enforcement lawyers asked the trial judge to dismiss the charge and argued that the law against the highest-ranking governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in state funds to the state’s Public Integrity Unit — which is based in Travis County and found guilty of state corruption in Texas — when Lehmberg refused to step down.
This veto led to a public complaint by a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth in Iowa during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry went on speculation that he would stop posting a tweet of a photo of himself while jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley once again declares housing market to be “normal”
One of London’s most prominent construction contractors pointed out that the housing market in south-east England has returned to a normal level.
Private homes in the capital were highly sought after and subject to huge price increases, which prompted the Bank of England to set ceilings for mortgage loans in June due to widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-end construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013,” adding that this is a “stable business environment.”
The real estate market in London was well established during the downturn as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the Catalyst Office, prices in the urban area rose by 18.5 percent last year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales overall.
Average sales prices at Berkeley’s private, affordable, and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year and amounted to <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made real estate in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months – some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible “village tax” ahead of the general elections in May.
London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, which introduced tighter lending arrangements, would lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year, both in real estate sales and prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also suggests that the property market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the rise in real estate prices in London to 3 percent in 2015, based on a already weakening house price awareness.
The transaction volume in London’s most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now declined by a quarter year-on-year, according to the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital city of Berkeley is a blessing, as the due amounts for future sales amount to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, sales on time remained stable as well."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than at the 2007 peak before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax income increased by 40 percent annually to <0xC2><0xA3>280 million, sales by 18 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday ahead of the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that revenue for Berkeley is expected to meet current market expectations in the current year.
Analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley shares stood at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in the afternoon in London trade.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence performing at the 85th Academy Awards.
Nude photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of another 100 Starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and accused the hacker of "a blatant violation of privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will track all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo-sharing page 4chan were allegedly obtained by a gap in Apple’s iCloud online storage system. The alleged “masterlist” of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Winste ben.
It’s not certain how many of the images are real, although Winstead, star of “Scott Pilgrim Against the Rest of the World” on Twitter also condemned the hack.
“To those of you who are looking at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house – I hope you are so happy with you,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" argues that the photos were about pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are FACT, people.
Let’s start with the beginning. *Wordplay intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos from her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new novel about love and the letter "J".
They broke down, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard that you have left standing in the rain.
Occasionally a woman told him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distant, and perhaps a bit scratchy.
Then he shook his hand.
He knew Kratzb<0xC3><0xBC>rst.
He was ugly, as in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stalemate was a just-beginning affair, which had been more promising for a relief from the lonely boredom of his life than otherwise, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a shimmering tender beauty with untouched hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older companion, who considered Kevern to be her aunt, and who had inherited a plot in a wet but paradise valley with the striking name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaky, there were still spiders in the bathrooms, naked snails had left their traces on all the windows and believed all this belonged to them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbage heads.
It was like the house from a fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the Longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn had sat on the broken lounge chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had clung mentally to the service console, which provided the country with calming music and soothing messages, and had been looking at her with a squeaky heart.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was so properly forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsolescence, just like the word obsolescence.
The general taste created what rulings and regulations would never have done, and as people in books choose the From teller-washer-to-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and love novels, so they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and hit big feet in a rough-comedy Serenade by Ailinn.
Ailin didn't understand.
"It was a well-known song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was young.
His father had played it with his own father, he had told.
When you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it costs you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game at the time, and it wasn’t very fun either.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
I had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly forbidden.
Improvising was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
The people wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
Just like the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without being heard by Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father’s half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn’t remember a time when pop singers weren’t black.
Again, there were no laws or restrictions.
A conforming society meant that every element of this society, thanks to the principle of group bestowal, agreed to be as grateful as those spared by fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and bodybuilding, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent and were tasked with ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the canalization; what was left of the Greeks, plater broke.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly, were afraid to be accused of fires, were even afraid that the flames would consume them as soon as they did, and were afraid that they would be consumed by the flames.
Everyone according to their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just uttered could ever be heard.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge colloidal leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He wanted to say it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She already thought he was something special.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern’s view.
There was nothing in the whole world to see but her uncombed black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so," she means without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're prepping me.
She seemed genuinely worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked at me again.
Your feet are not that straight.
Maybe your ankle, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you", but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverse.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he didn’t have the calming charm one needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel, too.
Maybe he wanted, Kevern, to be that.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and rose from her chair, threw the console around and poured the wine they had drunk.
Dutch flower wine, so drinking was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to shiver like a palm teddy bear in the storm.
"And your fat head is exactly the reason why I feel perversely attracted to you," she said...
Except I'm not.
She regretted him, both because of the unnecessary uneasiness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes as she rose up against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like this.
The same giant and ice-cold ocean broke down here and there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and sadder after WHAT TO DO when their ancestors had been smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pubs to pubs, always willing to raise their hand against a woman who refused or denied them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she hadn't taken care of it!
They first knuckle - knuckle was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the non-singing love ballads from the console - they first knuckle and then beat.
In Kevern’s view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the knucklehead itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He rose from the chair like an old man.
She also felt pale, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him as he walked away from a room on the upper floor, as if his companion were watching him, a man complaining about something he himself had complained about.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, though some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, embarrassed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was this a sight that she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time when she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn looked at Solomon’s feet.
Several years before the events just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, was recruited to a brief lecture on the continued violence at the low and middle level, was not raised to the level
"A lot has already been done, and much still needs to be done," she wrote, "to quicken the innate aggressiveness of a people that has waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human freedom was poured forth.
But some properties turn out to be inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion it continues to arouse.
The population weeps when hearing sentimental ballads, whispers to stories about overcome difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but still not only does the former rudeness keep the rural communities in check, as does our urban structures, but also gives up the new ones in hand,
“They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate,” her mentor said after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," answered Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Again, Esme relied on her right to privacy and denial of the statement.
Feminist?
Shut up again.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz finally, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is an unbiased job.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and commendable, can occasionally distort results as you have presented them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "retainable" and "raw", could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
Moving on to what is happening, what is happening, what is happening, as if it had happened yesterday, means taking the country its essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter century or so.
Smile at her neighbors, appreciate her partner, listen to ballads, attend musicals, use her phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
“I absolutely understand what you want out of it,” answered Esme Nussbaum in a calm voice, as she was sure that her supervisor had finished speaking, “and I say nothing but that we are not yet as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we might find ourselves repeating the mistakes that are only going to happen when they are going to happen.
But this time it is not the others in whom we let go of our anger and distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz built a pyramid with his hands.
In order to express an angel’s patience.
“They go too far,” he said, “if you call actions a ‘error’ that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far when they talk about leaving out their “wheat” and their “mistrust” to “others.”
In fact, it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are not talking about “us” and “others” when understanding the past as well as protecting the present.
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
“Of the one, if we are honest with ourselves,” dared Esme to say, “no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not complaining to anyone.
Whether it was bad or well done, what has happened has happened.
That was then.
There is no need to say anything more - we agree.
And just as no debt has to be assigned, no debt has to be repaid if such a repudiation is appropriate and if there is a way to forgive it.
But what does the past serve if we don't learn from it -
The past is for us to forget.
If I can say anything about it -
Luther Rabinowitz had his pyramid collapsed.
"I will consider her report," he said, and let her go.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was overtaken by a motorcyclist who, as described by passers-by, had gone on foot in a kind of "brutal anger".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; prime minister stays in South Africa
Officials from the Lesotho military have denied planning a coup d'état to overthrow the government and said they have committed crimes against police officers who are accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, noting that the country’s army surrounded its headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family to neighbouring South Africa after he reported on assassination threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was no de facto coup, but that the military was responding to the threat by "political fanatics" whose armament was provided by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho's defense forces acted after receiving several intelligence reports that within the police acting some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were standing in front of them," said Scha.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a coup.
“Even though no one has claimed to have forcibly torn the government apart, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho’s defense forces so far show signs of a coup,” he said.
A spokesman for Lesotho’s military said on Sunday that the soldiers retreated to their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the leadership of the government during Thaban’s absence.
Thabane said he believes he has become a target because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
There has been great tension in Lesotho since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the clashes in his unity government.
He said his actions would not have left the government indeterminate, otherwise blaring accusations in spite of.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the Eurozone slowed to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, according to a carefully observed study.
The final market purchasing manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a stand of 51.8 in July.
An indication above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced break-ins at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect the bank to have a clear plan for dealing with the euro zone’s slowing recovery as well as for the threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information over the course of this week on whether he is considering a quantitative easing for the eurozone, according to those carried out by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“While small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more apparent to manufacturers,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc’s second-largest economic nation, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as Italy’s decline from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Indications that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer available are also not reassuring," Mr Dobson said.
The decline in industry is likely to spark the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief business expert at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing you can say for the purchasing management index of the manufacturing industry in the euro area from August is that after that the sector continues to grow.”
He added: "Producers in the Eurozone currently find life obviously quite difficult, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and the confidence of consumers, and are likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that it will be "increasingly likely" that the ECB will eventually have to introduce a kind of QE, "though we suspect this will be limited."
The Hell of the Survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children trapped in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death from the terror attack in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the terrible siege of the Beslan school, in which 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatical Islamist terrorists children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the start of a new school year, captured and killed, this seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy brought the West and East together in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death from the terror attack in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that now visits Ukraine - and in children like them die - now comes to an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the school gym
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov, as she only tried to climb back into the school's shot-down sports hall after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida searched for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
“A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said at the time.
My legs were flooded with blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of operations, she considered herself completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I have to be operated on again.
Some of the grenade fragments are still in my knee.
Your goal now is to become a dentist to help people as you were helped by doctors.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it didn’t break me,” she says struggling.
“This has happened to me, and it cannot be changed.
Once a year I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory gets a little weaker each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself online as I go back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to the fact that such a thing does not happen again.
The boy who ran through the bullet hole, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at age 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven, he said, “Mama told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand.”
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Full of fear, she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a ball cage.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son in his arms outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara was knocked out and with leg injuries in the hospital, on her part assuming that her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now-dissolved newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion from then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to blow in my memory.
I still know that right after that I threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that’s not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember these kids that I played with in the yard and who didn’t make it out.
We never say they were killed or killed.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car upstairs.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends suffer.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, who last week worked as a volunteer in a monastery.
I'd love to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope that they will take me to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: “37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were just no children who could call and walk around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how Damir and I helped.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat Borshtsch and call them all local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shot at them with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
It was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said: “I always think this world hasn’t gotten any better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children were killed and still are killed.
These are just kids like ours.
I think for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people are feeling, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the horrors of the past.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember sometimes lying on the sofa, our face turned away, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got on my legs, I looked around, and I saw hell all around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have survived in this hell impossible.
“I remember calling him, ‘Damir, run, run away,’ but I was also so sure he didn’t hear me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
George Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the Greuel of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, a picture of Georgij today on the right
His blood-soaked face was drawn by fear as he ran around his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the Barbary of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dismissed him for his first day of school before she hurried off to take her older son Vladimir to university.
“I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days,” she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgian managed to survive.
The closer that date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days haunt me forever.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intrusive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden in our home in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: “It is important that something like this can never happen again.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never knowing the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is becoming something terrible.
“I can’t understand how that’s possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
It takes a few years to forget a little bit.
It has affected my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That’s why I always go to the gym when the 1st of September gets closer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friend.
It’s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I won't interfere.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and attend a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
Georgiy Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived even though he was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgiy Faniyev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
“We feel like it was yesterday,” says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but was unable to do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I’m older now and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences – I have to say, that’s not true.
“In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the following year - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I've lost consciousness.
I will never go back there again and please don’t ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Surviving: Georgij Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is terrible and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don’t like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can now walk well.
But because of my health, I was unable to study at the FSB’s Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical records, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, “I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about it and of course they should not suffer it either.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the festivities to remember.
I know Georgie won't go.
It must be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn’t.
I waited at home for him and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan are all drawn from it.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something like this happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has been operated several times, he can run, but not run a sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror by 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and this only reinforces my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart cries for the dead.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that in Ukraine many children have already been killed and many more are being killed.
If we could only attack and expel all these rebels - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby, which was so grippingly carried by a special bet command in safety
Rescued: Aljona Tskajewa is brought to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when Baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian police officer from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty held back their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous massacre.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl named after his lost daughter Kristina with his new wife Swetlana.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
“They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.

4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are to have for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all of which are available for a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Set your camera also to the photos or videos you want to capture.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Browse our Shopping Guide and the ratings for digital cameras for traditional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many won't work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, action cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see this underwater, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So you make a lot of shots.
If your camera has a row mode that allows a series of shots to be made with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse, the further you move away from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This also allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor light conditions.
It’s especially important when you’re working with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you’ll need to get closer to your objects when they’re meant to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the breed whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an anaesthesiologist, he devoted his career to saving the patient both the agony of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that diagnoses and diseases are important to doctors, while those treated are mostly busy with something quite different: pain.
However, one day in 2007 he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel it," he wrote in May of this year.
I had a hard time getting up.
As he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he made impatient accusations against his wife Juliet.
“I’d rather do it all now than later,” he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and uneasy.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to perform an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray were available.
He suffers from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the nipple, i.e. the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
While, for example, some smokers have lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers before.
Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which was once considered a "miracle substance" but has since been recognized as lethal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be easily ignored.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily pledged not to use it anymore.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - clamps, construction workers, room workers and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from a different time, it hardly seems to be worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the peak of a Mesolthelioma epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, even though asbestos has been illegal for years (1999 all types of asbestos have been banned), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still, present in the houses we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the shops we shop in.
And therefore, Mesothelioma knows no class limits, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant shopping malls in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
The parliament buildings are asbestos-contaminated.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been designated as the starting point.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was also not a climber.
In fact, it was hard for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I was training for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and carers - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
“Of the four doctors trained at Guy’s Hospital who have been suffering from mesothelioma for the past five years,” he wrote in a 2010 letter, “I am the last one to live.”
How many of us will still get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
This was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatally.
So we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will still get sick?”
Britain’s leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, estimates that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to subside, a total of 90,000 of the disease will fall victim to the disease.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they are going to die like this.

A brief look at the acts of the courts, to which the affected often turn due to compensation requirements, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had been exposed to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing division at two locations – one of them the flagship store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that this would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It has been used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but it is still considered by the EU and WHO to be a "great health risk" with possible death consequences.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocydolith) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that “there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates.”
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed at the flagship store in Oxford Street, London, asbestos Alamy
Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto’s work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He submitted a study of the affected in which it is presented that "a significant proportion of the mesothelioma was caused without known exposure by work or at home presumably by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can be sure of it.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been unwittingly exposed to the substance even in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind the Parliament’s outbuildings were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be stirred up by something as harmless as “strong air movements.”
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks as if it meets the opposite.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace has received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion of labour must be spent over several years to renovate the Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos in 2015
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one knows if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who has never been able to accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos charges were positively decided,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It’s so hard to remember all the places you’ve worked and the data.
What he still remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and had an operation late in the evening.
All of a sudden, I had a cold.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I could make the trip home any more.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the chest, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He did not go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took X-rays of his chest and used pleurathether to extract fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sporting activity and vigorous breathing.
In 2011, a patient came to Abbotts with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his GP brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt ill for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the chest cavity.
I am an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
To be honest, I didn’t worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: “I was told it was mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos,” he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) most likely came into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals were potentially life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it’s not just about hospitals.
Because of its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties, asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
All over the country, in thousands of hours of chemistry, students have put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
On websites, the topic of asbestos in schools is now often addressed.
And for this reason, such innocent items in our houses as floor slabs or shed roofs have by default contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial gift that’s contained in large parts of our properties,” notes Andrew Morgan, the attorney who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that fell on a affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you tear down your garden sheds.
The impact of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
“It takes a while to process that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I noticed that I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the change of perspective was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
“It was very difficult to record all of this,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How long do I have?’
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas party.
That was it then."
Mesothelioma is particularly secretive because it is our life-sustaining mechanism - the breath itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made up of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is rubbed up and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the chest cavity, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the nipple and can trigger cell mutations.
“The problem is with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers,” said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart thorax doctor who moved to Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
The hospital, which Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos, is now ironically a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pressed to the edge where the skin is from the respiratory process.
By nature, it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work as well for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation is hotly contested, for example.
Some people think it’s worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the nipple," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "doesn't talk very well about chemotherapy," which "shows effect", but doesn't heal.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham still struggles.
After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counselling office for co-workers four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he cheerfully introduced himself on calls.
“He was very positive,” Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Abbott had originally been offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last four months and are expected to extend his life by only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
“We had an advantage in that I didn’t have to be redirected, I just called and got an appointment,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would need to receive a referral and wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments eventually inevitably fail, many people are affected by another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health,” Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was recognized that a very low load also posed a health risk.
And this is where companies’ negligence began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually added to their case, but it wasn't what Morgan called a "full-fledged compensation", as Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after the investigation into his death, a spokesman for Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, it’s a huge problem for mesothelioma patients who are struggling to pay compensation to associate deadly asbestos contact with a company or workplace — usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there were clear new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma-affected people to claim compensation, even if their former employers are no longer to be found.
The law has set up a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million fund funded by the insurance industry for anyone diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove contact but can’t sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have promised them in a normal compensation process – about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications to the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million was a “very good job” of the insurance industry.
“This is a deal by insurers for insurers,” he says, and suggests that this sum is about a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if time hadn’t passed and mesothelioma patients found the companies and could sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law is “not perfect.”
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, in the face of seven deaths daily, quick action was necessary.
“People are suffering so much and need help today,” Penning said during a second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first consultation, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expected a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy – a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
“Of course, that’s the most important thing,” Abbott says.
This is often seen in patients.
There's something that keeps you going.
When you give up, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then in March 2014 I had a scan.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
That's not life-threatening.
That's life-ending.
Once again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible anymore.
But the process is physically and mentally very stressful.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
“For parents, it’s hard,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease that I wouldn’t get old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and rude.
She told it to her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma patients, such conversations are not driven by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as well as ultimately for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government election, protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament, despite the increased call for democratic reforms, decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 election by the Hong Kong electorate.
This move is likely to fuel the long-awaited protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists led planning and mobilization to do so within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People’s Congress basically allows the Communist leaders to reject all non-Beijing candidates.
“It’s not unexpected, but it makes us angry,” said Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said the admission of public nominations in the Hong Kong government elections would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when the UK gave back control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the residents choose the presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct right to vote for Hong Kong’s citizens, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the process going through a closely controlled Beijing-controlled nomination committee firmly in hand.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love of the country and love of Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public-effective protests in Hong Kong have taken place for several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central with Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shoot down the financial district if Beijing does not allow for genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
During the demonstration, the organizers said their movement has reached a new level of civil disobedience and they are planning protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide further information on this, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement "has only considered the occupation of the Central District as a last resort, an action that should take place only when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We regret to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing’s announcement for days, and there were heightened security measures on Sunday ahead of the government building, including police forces and barricades.
The unrest is compounded by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The attraction of people from the mainland strengthens competition for products and services.
In addition, the fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, will begin to crumble under Beijing’s growing pressure.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central movement as they jeopardized the business - the seeds of Hong Kong's life.
“The protests they’re talking about could cause major economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last,” said right-wing expert Regine Ip, who has long been critical of the movement.
We do not want to scare away fears that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China’s state-controlled media also recently reported democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights, in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the US will now be transferred to the universities where freshmen performances are offered by private jet.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and offer the UK’s first luxury travel service for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private jets, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security role.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to cuddle their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to this year ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said that no new bookings are yet available, as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the coming weeks."
The company also said that despite the tuition fees of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 per year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago – it’s more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as withdrawn.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education, said: “This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who begin their studies this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis, as the available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep up with the rapidly increasing bills for the simplest life bases, before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as a student home.
Feminists Criticize Race Question and Police Behaviour According to Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the gender before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, while tensions in the Midwest increased and received attention across the country, Perez saw that white women’s responses revolved 100% around the race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the August 9 shootings, personal essays with titles such as "Thinking about Ferguson from a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about suppressing women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant a big change.
“I don’t think that there are many people in feminism who talk about whiteness and privilege in such a high-class way,” she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but which are not considered “women’s issues” in the cultural space.
“I can post something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colors are under siege in their own country, silence is deafening.
“How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public space?” she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the topics clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now connect the topics of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s and gender research at George Mason University, says her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point where white women campaigners for women’s suffrage, such as Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for suffrage could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
“They made the decision to advocate for women’s suffrage, and the right to vote for black should come later,” Hattery said.
When one remembers such things, one becomes aware with power why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn’t do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the questions raised by Ferguson – police behavior, racial discrimination – is a mirror of the times when white feminists “catch” played with the problems that black women have faced for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to receive control?" asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists who built up their careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a punctuated article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist for the Guardian, in which she calls for more protests from white Americans on the topic of racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about race that are significantly different in public polls - will lead to the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which race as well as gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on race in America are still bleak.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks to Ferguson are counterproductive.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only problem that pushes itself into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors have taken up the country’s southwestern border this year, the issue of immigration reform is once again on the surface – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-consideration of the topic as an essential women’s topic they only have to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of working visas go to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories find a backlash in women’s organizations,” she said.
"Swine house" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that it had made itself comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
The details included an image of the living room of the house - which also included a pig that had his head lying on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"The photo, however, was erroneously published and has since been removed," a company spokeswoman said.
In the house’s exposition, Connells described the former assembly house as a “unique one-family house with one bedroom.”
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The house sale caused interest in social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW City of Harvey Homes a New Millionaire After Winning the Lotto
A lotto player from Harvey is out this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving nearly $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the draw of the first division for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
Shop owner Steve Forward said the profit provided conversation material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city speaks of nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a gain could occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division in the past month, a fee-based conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont had made a mega-win of $7.5 million just a few weeks earlier.
The winning pair had been playing for twenty years and said the win allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas bat in the Gladiator Arena
It was not only the gladiators that stood in the match at the first Rheinbacher R<0xC3><0xB6>mertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far more than 1000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rainshowers and the autumn cold and were completely enthralled by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful array of performances, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighting squad of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust combat art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and successively sent his men into the ring for a heroic two-fight in various Gladiator engagements.
First, the "provocateurs" were on the line with a rectangle and a short sword as well as a leg rail on the left leg and an arm rail on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short sword and thrower as well as an iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who attacked the "Secutor" with throwing net, dreizack and Dolch, and after a short battle the men fell to the ground.
Then the swords metallized, the shields were created, and the throwing plants flew surreptitiously through the arena, that a fear and fear could become about the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, had an always attentive eye on it.
“We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman period experienceable,” explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer “Friends Circle of the Roman Canal”, the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting speech, was taken from the amusement park for a day.
After all, the Romans not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of this were also to be admired during the Roman day, such as "Aqueduct Marble" from the eleven meters high and 1400 meters long Roman canal bridge, which stood at L<0xC3><0xBC>ftelberg.
The Frontinus company faced the water and energy supply once and now, and managing director Petra Fricke knew: "We are still benefiting from the knowledge of the time".
This is also confirmed by the diploma measurement engineer Ralph Heiliger of the "Engineering TeamZwei" from Rheinbach, who introduced measuring instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the hot air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressive is also the footprints that were left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the footsteps of sound before burning it.
In 2011, the Landesverband Rheinland’s Landesverband had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the North commercial park in Rheinbach.
We found the walls of an economic building with a barn for drying cereals and for grinding.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural property, the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
A series of finds from these excavations presented it in a glass showcase, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, as well as parts of a charming necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the German invasion of the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
At her, the children also dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today’s mill game, or they wrote their names as once the Roman students with metal handles on waxboards.
At the stand of the R<0xC3><0xB6>merthermen Z<0xC3><0xBC>lpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, at the stand of the Rheinbach Glass Museum and at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Centre they used a heavy stone wheat mill to grind the flour for a flat bread or a musli.
With the original Roman travel cart drawn by two cold flowers, the visitors drove through the amusement park and also came across the impressive status of the City High School, which presented here the results of their "Roman project weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also contribute to the Roman year 2014 proclaimed throughout the Rhineland, which is supposed to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2,000 years ago.
Together with the Home and History Associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered and reminiscent of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary is told of his work on the nearby Wachtberg, presenting plants as living monuments from the Roman period, and presenting a funny lesson in terms of popular understanding between a group of Wachtbergers "Germans" and attracted Romans.
The Adendorfer Grundschule dedicates itself to the Roman theme within the framework of a project week.
With the Roman week, the numerous but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg will be re-explored.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus, a small presentation will remind us of the discovery of the Berkumer Matronenheiligtum in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is affecting West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a severe blow to the economy.
Markets are neglected - and international companies go to a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is hitting the West African economy hard.
The crop rots on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are wiped out - the virus has severely added to the region.
Some international companies are already on the go.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one,” said the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is hardest hit.
“It’s a total disaster, we’re losing a lot of money,” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothing on the second largest market in Liberia’s capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola come to the market.
Liberia has been hardest hit by the virus, alone more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
Recently, the health authorities declared that the disease was prevalent in every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people have died and thousands more have joined.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries, companies set up their operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers are also reacting: Only a few buyers are still leaving their home towns to get a subsidy.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, the cocoa and coffee beans important for export are rotting on the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
“People are going to travel less and less,” says Philippe De Vreyer, a Parisian expert on West Africa’s economy.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables prefers to stay at home.
The population, therefore, gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is scarce.
In the markets, the stock of basic foods such as rice disappears.
At the same time, the region heavily dependent on international companies is at risk of image damage – with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest risk is that international companies will avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
It is important to know how far and how long the virus will continue to spread.
Investors may have the impression that “it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore also to invest,” warns Hugon.
The disease also puts strain on the state budgets of the states
The disease also puts strain on the state budgets of the affected states.
The rating agency Moody’s fears that its budgets will be severely hampered by high spending on the health care system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 million).
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where so far only a few cases of Ebola have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region of southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of an infection.
Reservations in hotels are also significantly reduced.
Defenders celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schutzenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
On high tours, preparations for the 50th founding festival run at the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>tzenverein Tannenwald from 12 to 14 September.
It is planned on Friday, September 12, a great evening of entertainment with the group "Dorfrocker".
Saturday at 6 p.m. is the big bull shooting.
Afterwards, in the large tent of the mood evening with the "Stoapf<0xC3><0xA4>lzer Spitzbuam".
Blaskapelle takes care of the music
Highlights on Sundays are the Festgodtesdienst and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the big festival train at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon there is also the price distribution of the Federal and Gaussian shootings.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 ladies of the party with their dirndln.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The patronage has been taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert F<0xC3><0xBC>racker.
The original name "Sch<0xC3><0xBC>tzengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when on 21 March the association was founded for "social entertainment through exercise in room- and small-caliber shooting".
The Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who on April 30 in the inn of Lukas raised the "new" patron club "Tannenwald" Berngau out of baptism.
Karl M<0xC3><0xA4>rz and Adolf Ried led the club as a champion through a difficult initial period, when it was mainly about finding a club venue and installing the shooting facility.
In the autumn of 1965, the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>tzenverein started in the restaurant "Leininger" with two teams in the rounds.
In the following years, the sports shooters, which were now organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes until the 1st Gauliga.
The club's record was set annually and the magic limit of 380 rings was first reached by Rudi Meier in 1980.
Just as the performance of active shooters has increased, so have the number of members.
After the club premises "Leininger" no longer meet the requirements of a modern patron's association, the management board at the time, under the leadership of Johann Rinn, decided to create a future domicile in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof H<0xC3><0xA4>rteis" (Landgasthof H<0xC3><0xA4>rteis).
On 8 May 1988, after 2700 hours of work, the parish priest Strasser gave the blessing to the church for the new patron rooms.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th Gauss shooting, associated with the solemn consecration of the new patron flag in July 1991.
On the 23rd and 24th of April 1994, the Schutzenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995 a B<0xC3><0xB6>ller Group was established.
Josef Schmalzl became B<0xC3><0xB6>llerreferent.
A major challenge for the "B<0xC3><0xB6>llerers" and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the Bayerische B<0xC3><0xB6>llerreffen in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the association have modernized the rooms and the shooting facility in the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in round matches
You can also see the sporting performance of the Association of Defenders.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the rounds: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one sports pistol KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the ANB) to the district league 1 in the round 2013/14.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has climbed from the Gauliga Nord into the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as Bockstechen, Faschings- und K<0xC3><0xB6>nigsball, club excursion and Christmas celebration have tradition.
The patrons are also present at the festivals in the parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffers accident when returning to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the racetrack ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time, after his right front tyre fell in round 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team boss Chad Johnston said his 14-man team was disappointed, but now focuses on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
“I wish we had a better bet and a better result for him,” Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can make it better there.
Stewart had already driven into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went into a good result today with pretty good hopes," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the trailer and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ashtray race in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the pursuit.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped onto the road during a race to confront Stewart.
Authorities said on Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether or not Stewart will have to rely on an indictment.
The three-time champion was received with great admiration when he was presented before the race.
After a start in 12th place, Stewart had just moved into the top 10 and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs arrived
Car with the No. 18 out of control after exiting curve 2 and collided with Stewart, both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart went on, but fell back to 21st place.
Happy New Year's Eve
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to competitors.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in TV Jahn also make it possible to create full-day lessons at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have strongly decimated themselves.
Now, reinforced youth is sought for a sport that is healthy and has great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups by Lisa Neitzel, a former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight- to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve- to 15-year-olds," the 20-year-old says.
With more assets, the whole thing would be much more fun, “you could dance completely different choreographies,” she says.
Anyone who wants to dance can jump into the training class without any obligation on Thursdays between 5 pm and 6 pm or on Fridays between 5 pm and 6.30 pm in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistra<0xC3><0x9F>e 9, without obligation.
“The training starts regularly with a warm-up program,” says the coach.
After that, various choreographies are performed.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no set shape and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements of folklore from classical to sport and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, socialization is not too short.
“We also go to dinner, watch dance movies and we’ve already stayed in the dance room,” says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
For those who don’t like jazz dancing, you can also go to one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always take part in classes on Wednesdays in the fields of children's dance/jazz dance, children's ballet, video-clip-dancing and hip-hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Mondays and Wednesdays.
Anyone interested in Discofox, Slow Rollers, Vienna Rollers, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango can preview and participate.
Bulgarian prison guards protest across the country <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria staged a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of demands to be discussed with Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and are calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison staff and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations continue, the Director General for the implementation of criminal measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, told the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the Union Association of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army abandons Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters are still on the march.
After heavy fighting, allegedly involving Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army abandoned the airport of the Luhansk rebel stronghold on Monday.
The army also said that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership, without mentioning details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists have again shot down a fighter jet and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, the insurgents said on Monday, according to Russian news agencies.
Ships of the Coast Guard sunk
The rebels also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard for the first time in the Sea of Azov.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships had been shot down on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards have been injured, a spokesman in Kiev told the broadcaster 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported having brought several villages in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
Today, in the Belarusian capital Minsk, the Ukraine Contact Group meets.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In advance, all the actors used their performances to publicize their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe due to the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adheres to the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
However, the NATO chief accused Russia of "a sharp break" of the agreement.
“Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
From documents and statements from the Russian side, it emerges that "they regard us as enemies".
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced plans to strengthen NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe.
A “Readiness Action Plan” to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that “we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as necessary,” Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed, according to official information, on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
Negotiations are set for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
A decision by the European Union is yet to be taken as to whether it will also be sent to a representative for the talks.
Due to the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not been getting any fuel from Russia for weeks.
Recently, EU Energy Commissioner G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Oettinger had communicated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also stop supplying gas to Europe.
Europe accounts for about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel says death will come 'very clear'
Now, the Chancellor has made it clear once again.
But it is not a free letter for all complicated details.
Serious concerns from the CDU against the car tolls have visibly worsened the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken after persistent opposition from her CDU to introduce a car tout.
"To put it quite clearly: she is in the coalition agreement, and she will come," the party chief said on Monday after meetings of the CDU top-level committees in Berlin.
Merkel, however, did not stick to a detailed model at first.
In the black-red government program, "certain parameters" are called.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal, and it is now being further worked on".
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble (CDU) is also contributing constructively to the consultations for a bill.
In addition to the topic, he also talked with Dobrindt about other ways to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, for example in broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it." Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house testing its own concept to reward highway investors with bribery - after the 2017 election.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
“The coalition agreement never meant to undermine all the circuit and federal roads,” said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU country president.
In so far as it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to speak again on the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU-Landesverbanden Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
The background is fears that a toll will affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded the CDU coalition loyalty due to the toll criticism.
The left sees the plans in the face of the dispute in the Union as failing.
"The Murks death is dead," said party chief Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabr<0xC3><0xBC>ck newspaper" (Monday).
"With the toll, the minister fails". Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which is scheduled to start in 2016.
However, according to the coalition agreement, domestic car owners are not allowed to be charged extra.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll via the car taxes.
However, according to EU law, the model must not harm foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
It actually suffers from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an insecure gait, and curved toes.
Diseases also suffer from feelings of numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Peaceful Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she turned 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who are now 51 years old, said: “As a child I knew I couldn’t do the same thing as the others.
I kept falling and everything took longer with me.
I could never ride with the other kids wheelchair or skateboard and was often bullied at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she noticed her illness when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library, and wrote to the FA Society,” she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would be in the wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in the meantime slowly lose all my skills.
I did all this alone with myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, it became clear to her that her abilities had not decreased as strongly as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you would be in the wheelchair right now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, her CMT was found.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner,” she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a.D. Berni Dieter has been working as a firefighter since the closure of the former army training camp
For almost ten years, no more shots have been fired at the former army training ground in M<0xC3><0xBC>nsingen.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition still appears every month in the heart of the biosphere reserve Schw<0xC3><0xA4>bische Alb.
The grenades are sometimes still so dangerous that they have to be blasted on site.
An ear-bleeding bang holds in the blasts over the heart of the biosphere reserve.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the M<0xC3><0xBC>nsingen training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time, the 6,500-hectare area has been the core of the Schw<0xC3><0xA4>bische Alb biosphere reserve, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated routes.
Tax burden on business people in the Washington area rises with economic recovery
Restoring the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for businesses in the country rose slightly last year as economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local authorities in fiscal year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of companies rose 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth following the several years of declining reporting in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more than local taxes by 4.3 percent, according to a study conducted by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s revenue comes from corporates.
Virginia has the lowest tax revenues from companies with 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is based on a recovery in the company’s property values, the researchers say, which led to a 3.7 percent increase in property taxes this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of these profits came from major states such as California, New York, and Texas, the process also seems to be for the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 – an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values is not as effective in raising state and local tax revenues in Maryland, as real estate taxes account for just over a fifth of corporate tax returns.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
“In Maryland, a large part of the property, especially in the D.C. tax area, is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that don’t pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to be able to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Corporate income also appears to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took in $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is moving in the same direction, the local tax burden for businesses does not rise evenly in all three places.
The rate of increase in the district corresponded to the national average of 4.3 percent, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an under-average tax return of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income tax rates with 6 percent in all three branches of government (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district, it is 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that lower state and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and overall a better tax climate prevails than in Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina passed laws to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6%, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to achieve its income goals in the coming year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate by up to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be better off, and they are therefore paying more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people – a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized by – in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes combined.
The researchers say that the trend and rise in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with an increase in general multi-tax revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Yet the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government’s spending cuts have an impact on the labor market in the region.
Partner City: German Beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city of Guangzhou - this is the urgent desire of the officials in China.
“We would be very happy if a German brewery would settle in our city,” said Li Yiwei, deputy party secretary for the South China metropolis, this week while visiting an SPD delegation in his city.
Again and again, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China came back to this issue of the 12 million-strong metropolis during the course of the conversation.
Guangzhou, also called canton in Germany, is one of China’s richest cities, Li said.
Therefore, people also possess the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would investigate in Germany after a possible partner for the project.
“It doesn’t take much for beer: good water, cereals and life satisfaction,” he added at lunch with the party beer in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiates Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
After that, the official from Guangzhou came up with a sheep-gumble - but with red wine, which was served for food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German Purity Command.
More business traffic
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Deputy Party Chief Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but in 2012 it was cancelled for economic reasons.
“It would be worth it again,” the local politician said.
"Business traffic between our two cities is steadily increasing".
At present, travelers should take the bypass over Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the air connection.
The vice governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire in the spotlight in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," answered Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded in agreement.
Maintained partnership
Guangzhou’s ludicrous vice-party chief hopes to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already in the main, but not yet in this position.
He came to office only this year after his predecessor had been removed from office due to corruption charges.
Local party chief Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is being vigorously enforced by head of state Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a senior official in Fujian, where the automaker VW built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9000-kilometer Guangzhou is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Perflux is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse with its economic power.
Next year, it wants to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Family of Joan Rivers "presses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was admitted to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter is hopeful that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're all pushing the thumbs.
Her mother was reportedly admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency due to cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which continues to be described as "serious".
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Eco-friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In the future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that are commercially available today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from September 1 receive a label on which the buyer can recognize central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars in the "Euro 6" class of pollutants, sharper nitrogen oxide values apply.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolders: they receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer – and video producer, and a variety of other things – buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service was a cool billion-dollar thing, and the collaboration also appeared of course.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their masterpieces in games, a "YouTube for live games," an insider said.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which whistleblowers give the (mostly older) games a touch of secret science theater, is already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken a little bored, a textbook example of an established tech company buying a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn’t come about, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement from Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster.”
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who explain that they prefer to watch sports than watching sports, it’s hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching others while playing rather than even taking control console in hand.
It’s one thing to look over your shoulder at 3 a.m. as you slip through Resident Evil, and something quite different to watch a spinner get shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You can watch all of these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the quick runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age play all games in record time are amusing.
But as long as it’s not a game or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel probably isn’t that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me already know?
Twitch is visited by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch will be as elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have easily swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are sold as advertisers.
Like the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallowed - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the H<0xC3><0xBC>pfburg at the Burggartenfest on Sunday evening.
The concept of the organisers was correct.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday evening, an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the castle garden.
Sometimes the entrance had to be stopped.
“That was annoying,” said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedel Burggarten is intended to radiate brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes anyway.
This was already evident in the early Sunday evening when the first visitors opened up to the Open Air.
A feast for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And that's what they did.
Around the supply stands on the Burggartenwiese, Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearby and further surroundings had made themselves comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, rocked with their feet in the beat, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were meant.
And that through the generations.
While one of them lingered on the extra-curved white sand on the beach bar, others lingered on a quarter of wine in the winery, the young fell on the H<0xC3><0xBC>pfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in children's make-up, the volunteers had to do all their hands in the truest sense of the word to become the master of the Andrang and conjure up imaginative creations in the small faces.
The bigger ones used the kicker tables or took part in a skateboard workshop, which was organized by the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 5:30 p.m., he spat at the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry.
However, the attraction of the festival did not interrupt this.
“There were more people coming than expected,” said Ron Sem, who spoke of a “success on the whole line.”
Therefore, there is nothing against a repeat of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still needs to be worked on, Sem made clear in a first report on Sunday against the popular vote.
As annoying, he said that in the meantime the entrance had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little force.
As a result, some who had already paid did not come to the site anymore.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who were tumming in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedel hip-hop band Blocks<0x60>n<0x60>Rox broke off their performance.
The technicians were not able to create a semi-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a tire pan.
“They will be there next year,” the organiser said.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will still be forgiven at the first time, but need to be eliminated at the second edition.
Even in the social network Facebook, the organizers have to include criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you have just expected more," Melanie Meier said on the event page.
"You've taken over a little bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems very closely.
I think it’s very good that some people are not only dumb but also really trying to put something on their legs.
Hat off!" writes Stephanie Jenss to the amula.
Now the organisers have a year to put off these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
This is not expected to be the case.
Rather, the component that is ready is waiting to be used in the distinctive structure.
The action is in the context of a larger action: Almost 50 years after the creation of the space observation radar TIRA, the shell, the so-called radom, is completely renewed.
The new radom will be slightly smaller than the old one with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
The size is still a world record.
The last step to complete the new case is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old case is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new case is set up.
If the weather plays out, the action is supposed to go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge, Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from the UK cried so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she violated the bone structure of her face.
This ice-bucket challenge was painfully missed.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after she had cried so much during the Ice Bucket Challenge that she rubbed her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK was screaming so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she violated her facial structure.
“The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did, my jaw just stayed standing,” she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn’t work, the jaw was hooked, and then I realized something wasn’t right.
My mother and sister saw this too and almost made themselves in the pants before laughing, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was admitted to the hospital to have the jaw re-arranged after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Are the castle clubs soon going to pull on a string again?
Finally, there was always a dispute between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen.
Now the board is thinking about possible cooperation.
As an example of the reconstruction of the Wolfratshaus Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshaus Castle Friends, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunden Wolfratshausen.
In a very different way, so far, the points of view seemed to deal with the history of the Wolfratshaus Castle and a possible reconstruction.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks on a common approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the club’s directors Torsten Sj<0xC3><0xB6>berg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
“I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could get together once,” Sj<0xC3><0xB6>berg reports.
In his opinion, all members of both clubs could be drawn back to one strand in the future.
This makes it easier to record visible successes.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath were watching a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, the castle club around Sj<0xC3><0xB6>berg is at the forefront of the "development and experience" of the site.
Herbert Piffl, Second Chairman of the Friends of the Castle, was very pleased with the call, according to his own statements.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been the castle friend.
A new chairman is scheduled to be found in a member meeting in mid-September.
The association currently has around 40 members, according to the 74-year-old.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the union activities rest out of respect." This "thinking phase" was necessary to "consider how it could proceed".
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also make themselves a current image of the mood within their grouping.
There is no candidate for the presidency at the moment, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find him." He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad T<0xC3><0xB6>lz.
The new president should be a Wolfratshauser.
The T<0xC3><0xB6>lzer wants to work on the project "but very much like to continue working on it".
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He honors Dimbath as a "Missionary" who always believed in rebuilding the castle.
Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Due to the high participation of the population as well as by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was skeptical at first.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to move the project forward." A "setting feature" could be created for the city of Flu<0xC3><0x9F>erererstadt.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to just throw the idea of rebuilding on board," he hopes that the castle club may be moving at this point.
Their goal of documenting the story first is “important and good”.
After that, you could look further.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, fast-secondary student Matt Schroeder was considering a clever sparide.
He invented a loan system for books by students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
“My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A cookie,” said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management reported that on average, students spend more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and study materials, however, there were different cost mitigation options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Hiring textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said that the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in college bookstores last spring, said Neebo’s vice president Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased at campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the one-time for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books online only cost a third of the price for which they are to have in the on-campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
If you don’t mind the notes of other or normal usage tracks, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is required to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, advised students to ask their professors if past expenses were permissible.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditures can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest expenditure.
Apart from Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative to used books.
Renting
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them fairly well, remember to give them back and you don’t want to keep the books after the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent “calculus” for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms of the business you are renting from, including the penalties that may apply to writing notes, endorsements or traces of use.
If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from retailers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics nowadays can be downloaded for free, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
In any case, look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for price determination in books, as one can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering online one should check, according to Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and eventually paid the full price in college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" was not a box office hit
Sylvester Stallone's "The Expendables 3" grossed less than $30 million from his $90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" grossed just $12 million from his $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz's film "Sex Tape" grossed just $14.6 million at the opening weekend, while children's films such as "Dragon Tooth Made Easy 2" also disappoint revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in children’s films could be the reason for the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 "the worst year" so far for children's films and described "dragon teeth easily made 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, in films for a slightly older audience, it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer film launch, which was shown between American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year on at least 2,000 canvases.
The results are based on the opinion of cinematographers and film critics and indicate that this year’s film hits are the same as last year’s.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s upcoming Jungle Book film, told the Hollywood Reporter: “I think the times are changing.”
We must accept this and not try to trace the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently achieved sales with streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as it did last year, in which sales amounted to $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comic book films and predicting a "core meltdown" of Hollywood.
In light of the current devastation, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential box office battles to be expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in box office results as simply "cyclical" and told Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office ever, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
When the 2nd table tennis district class was removed a few years ago for the purpose of punishing the league division, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the German Football Association has added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to the program.
As a result, those who have not gone up have gone down.
G<0xC3><0xB6>ttingen’s top-class team Torpedo in the Oberliga relegation has avoided the decline, but will play only fifth-class in the coming season.
Fourth-class Torpedo women remain in the Regional League despite their grand breakthrough.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserve will join the new league, in which the Landesliga are no longer represented by G<0xC3><0xB6>ttinger clubs.
For the ladies, TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the Torpedo second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new district league South.
This is where TSV Seulingen, VfB L<0xC3><0xB6>dingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC join.
In the district league play as regional representatives Dransfeld and SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III.
G<0xC3><0xBC>ntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/W<0xC3><0xB6>llmarshausen start up in the district league.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
The district league of the SCW boys - where Torpedo II is still starting - is also not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two G<0xC3><0xB6>ttingen circuits start with nine teams each.
In the West-Staff are the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the East, Sattenhausen/W<0xC3><0xB6>llmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play among others.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/W<0xC3><0xB6>llmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in Osterode, where there are no more women’s teams at the circuit level.
Noting that none of the six 2nd circuit classes will reach the target strength, here the innovative and agile circuit board will have to think about it.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called counter summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments for us over the weekend and spoke with demonstrators who travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers Fly Out of the Blue Mountains
Two young bushwalkers were brought to safety with the rope wind after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govett’s Leap in Blackheath for their tour.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search group of local police and rescue services broke up and the couple were found near Bridal Veil Waterfalls at about 11 p.m.
The girl had injured herself on the knee and the man had fallen and had hit his head.
Rescuers stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered in stable condition with a ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital.
escalating anti-government protests in Pakistan
About 1,000 protesters were pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
After about half an hour, the transmitter resumed broadcasting.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the protesters equipped with sticks had damaged devices in the editorial office.
No deaths or injuries have been reported.
The protesters demand the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said about a kilometer away from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence on Monday that some 3,000 protesters had come back to clash with security forces.
According to the hospital, a police officer was injured.
At least three people had been killed and more than 500 injured over the weekend as protesters tried to force Sharif's residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and without using force" after a meeting in the army headquarters on Sunday evening.
It further said in the message: "The army remains committed to its role to ensure the security of the state".
The escalating violence has raised concerns about military intervention, which has already cleared more often in the past.
The protests, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri, have been ongoing since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters on Sunday to persevere.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri spoke similarly.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election in May last year by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The protesters had initially stood peacefully in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called them over the weekend to demand Sharif's residence.

With the 2-0 over Gr<0xC3><0xB6>dig, a bitter week on Sunday ended for Rapid.
“The victory is very liberating,” said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team with the Europa League exit had reached an intermediate low on Thursday.
“The success experience was incredibly important,” confirmed Captain and Torsch<0xC3><0xBC>tze Steffen Hofmann, who took third place with Green White.
Schrammel-Draumtor brings Rapid to Victorstra<0xC3><0x9F>e Rapid with the second win of the season has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes with a successful experience into the national game break.
“We wanted to show a positive reaction,” said Thomas Schrammel, an outsider who, with his magnificent leader-volley from the sixteenth corner in the 14th minute, has set the course for victory.
“I thought I’d bring the whole frusto from Thursday and snuck it under the latte,” the 26-year-old said smiling.
When Schrammel met for the last time on 13 November 2010 in a Bundesliga match, it was still for Ried.
The first champion in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in special memory for him.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the rapid growth," said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic’s short-term pelvis, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and also did his thing very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in a mirror error.
He has earned the goal, he has already done some assists this year," Barisic praised.
The team showed character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after a good one hour, which finally made the decision.
The guests would have been able to write in front of it.
"Thank God we had some luck today," said Schrammel, who played on the gaping performance and result over the past few weeks: "The results have not been right, but the playing field has always been good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that one had been “better in many games than today” – against “the strongest team that played at this stadium this season.”
The first three-pointer since July 26 has therefore proven that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
No less pleasing to him: "That we have finally played too zero again".
Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger there are several failures to complain about, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start-up debuts makes the victory even more valuable.
"You can't forget that," said Barisic, who lost three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who were very stable lately."
The national game break must therefore be used to "leak wounds and add a little bit to the physical area," said Barisic, who has five U21 selectors in his ranks.
One to which the break is probably particularly situated is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks up for the team, goes over the pain.
It was at this very difficult stage that he showed that he is a very important player for us," Barisic said.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before being replaced in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who finished his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first match out since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't think everything is going well now" "We've probably had a bit of luck too, but at some point luck has to come back to us too.
Now was the time,” Hofmann said.
He said: “You can’t always see this in black and white.
We haven’t played as badly in the last few weeks as it has been shown.
But we can’t believe that everything is going well now.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It’s a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
At certain stages, they are holding on to me,” Hofmann said.
Gr<0xC3><0xB6>dig coach Michael Baur had little to say about himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counter-attack "from the category of magic gate", as well as the regular goal of utility in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly misunderstood by the referee's colleague.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards goal in some phases.
We have had too few conclusions.
Internal defender Maximilian Karner saw it similar: "It just started badly, but then we found it clean and even made a goal.
Overall, there would have been more in it.
Under this whip there is peace
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle assignment of the summer series "My Piece of Rh<0xC3><0xB6>ner Gl<0xC3><0xBC>ck" last Friday.
Several of these tree roses are still in the district, the depicted specimen is the "Gi<0xC3><0x9F>ruheiche" above Unterwei<0xC3><0x9F>enbrunn.
A meandering walk leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak.
It passes by groups, basalt piles and basalt seas.
A bit below the quarry from Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it overlooks the other trees of the surrounding area and recalls an American mammoth tree with a circumference of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has additionally consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and interviewed older people from Unterwei<0xC3><0x9F>enbrunn to find out what their relationship with the geissruheichheiche is.
The result of his investigations remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goat herds were supposed to have driven their animals out of the under-wealth well into the fields that were hard-fought and free from stones.
At the foot of the tree are said to have rested the animal keepers exhausted from the ascent.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because on the meadows there are actually herds of goats again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has further found out.
When entering the stone collections, however, one should be careful, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place to stay for cross-zotters.
A hiking trail leads from Unterwei<0xC3><0x9F>enbrunn to the tree, but which is somewhat hidden.
Other paths are signposted, ascending towards Hochrh<0xC3><0xB6>n and inviting you to an extensive hike.
Where is the water castle?
However, a water castle, which is sought at our next task, is more rarely to be found at the level.
The reflection in the grave already gives a good impression of the building, but we have in the district some historical buildings to which the building counterfei could fit.
Where is our "piece of Rh<0xC3><0xB6>ner's happiness"?

After a week-long hiatus, Italy’s Prime Minister and acting EU President, Matteo Renzi, passed the nomination of his foreign minister Federica Mogherini as EU foreign policy chief last week against strong conservative resistance at the EU special summit, she will succeed British Catherine Ash.
Renzi considers, as La Repubblica, close to the government newspaper, the call of his Mogherini, who is also a favorite in the government team, to strengthen the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He is also expecting a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the ever-increasing left-wing party base against him, because Mogherini is assigned to it, albeit in a moderate way.
Against the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Polish President-designate Donald Tusk, the prevailing opinion in Rome will be to create a political balance.
At the same time, the EU’s chief diplomats will be Deputy Commissioner Juncker.
The consent of the European Parliament still pending is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the appointment of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is spreading optimism that for almost two decades, those who have proved themselves in leading party offices and who are known for their ambition will be exposed to the "enormous challenges" of Mogherini.
The native Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (left-wing Democrats), which merged with the Catholic center party Margherita into the present-day Social Democratic PD in 2008.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
With the 2001 election in the party of the Left Democrats, she entered the high party politics, worked in the foreign policy department, soon becoming its leader.
It occupied traditional focus areas of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies of NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop quota, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party’s more than 40 percent vote in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The reservations in Brussels, the new EU foreign minister has too little diplomatic experience, so lack of substance, is being contested in the PD.
In Brussels, particularly by Poland and the Baltics, the treacherously realistic accents of Mogherini on the crisis in Ukraine are being pursued and defamated as a "Russian-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe, which also serves Italy’s energy security.
After Renzi took office as EU president in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first state visit.
The photos they showed with Putin at the shake-up were taken in Brussels with outrage, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief for October to a Milan economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their education at Emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an azubi who has already completed another training in the company.
In four training professions, the new employees will work in the future: Electronics (three trainees), Mechatronics (two), Tool Mechanics (two) and Process Mechanics (two).
All azubis come from Schwandorf district: Tobias Braun and Thomas B<0xC3><0xBC>cherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidtgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously visited primary and secondary schools and real-world schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all ages as well as the trainers will go to a team training event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees in Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees distributed over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should "keep their mouths shut and make France okay," Francois Hollande's main ally said.
Mr. Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president whose cabinet formation has come under disapproval in the vast majority of the French.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay by his side," he said with great applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not call into question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite fierce demands for a loosening of the rule on the part of Emmanuel Macron, the new economic minister.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande called on his fellow socialists to show "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the justice minister, shoved sand into the gearbox, where she appeared at a meeting of deviant socialist MPs, and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French “the faith in their future.”
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the socialists’ constant trench battles and said she could not imagine the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has none either, they are forced to form a new government when the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one won't survive autumn or winter either," Ms Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party's reputation after a dissolution of parliament and said she was confident to stand out as a winner in the run-up to elections and was ready for government.
France’s ruling party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead in the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking into several rival factions before the end of Holland’s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve an improvement in the economy and record unemployment.
“There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise provider, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market value company, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises as well as its wealthy customer base, while it would provide access to larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Stehtt Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesman for Apollo declined a comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion and is expected to grow in the coming years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies try to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice among cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. regulatory authorities for the stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in 2008 in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
At the end of June, Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares, and the private equity company TPG Capital LP a 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly share 82 per cent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the launch of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A Beijing-based group swirled the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed a framework law on Sunday that allows only two or three candidates for the 2017 Hong Kong leadership election.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be staffed with Beijing-based members.
This decision will make it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote, prompting pro-democracy activists to realize their threat and destabilize Hong Kong’s financial hub with “Occupy Central” protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership fears that calls for democracy will expand to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which outlined China’s rule over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, with hundreds of thousands marching into the city’s business district and organizing a sit-in there.
Li’s survey is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal Affairs, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Office of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the day.
Student activists announced that they would meet in the afternoon in front of the top Hong Kong office.
Britain did not foresee any democratic elements until the end of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin calls on Kiev to record “state talks” with Eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government stop the fighting against separatists in the east of the country and immediately resume negotiations on the "statehood" of the abject region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its status towards Ukraine would have to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin’s call to the Kiev government for negotiations at eye level with the pro-Russian rebels fits the strategy he apparently pursued since the start of the riots five months ago: aid for the separatists in taking over territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government with a new nocturnal fact to pro-Russian Russia.
In an interview with the state television channel Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to retake the separatist-held territories in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula to Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorossija" or "Neurussland", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary glitz of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on Oct. 26 and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in the separatist-held areas are hoping for immediate peace talks "captured in their illusions."
"We must immediately engage in detailed talks, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of South-Eastern Ukraine, in order to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to statehood in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
It’s not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it’s not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it’s about an internal conflict in Ukraine.”
The Kremlin’s clarification of Putin’s remarks on correcting “misinterpretation” underscored Russia’s leadership’s claim to deal with the separatist rebellion in the east as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and pre-conflict polls yielded a broad majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, and thus give the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects the Russian state territory with Crimea.
The peninsula annexed to the Black Sea five months ago is the home port for most of the Russian Navy as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his inaugural address on June 7 that Ukrainian legislation - after the new elections - should consider additions to the constitution, which will allow the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of the languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to stand in stark contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armament and assemblage Moscow is accused of.
Putin’s last call to Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders at eye level followed a further push by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks crossed the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov into eastern Ukraine.
The separatists backed by Russia have taken control of Novoasovsk, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have been underway to secure Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday and urgently called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just in front of a point where there is no turning back," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which are to come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, said in a statement.
The first possibly 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers who were captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal about Australian promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Noblesten made no secret of his anger over hackers who allegedly stole nude pictures of his fiancé Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who of the Hollywood A-Promis.
The film city is in turmoil after a series of unambiguous photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence have surfaced in a hacking scandal about promis on the Internet.
The hacker in charge probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, Star from "the tribute of Panem" and Superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne reportedly also took private photos due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 Promis on the list.
The nobleman, who had been engaged to Greece last month, told Confidential: “It’s disgusting.”
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, said on a news website that the hack was "shameful" and that the victims "felt injured".
The hacker allegedly has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she lies up without in a pool.
Palmer’s films include “Love is Invincible” with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comment on the hacked images yesterday.
A Lawrence's representative told TMZ: "It's a hideous violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing more than selling Hehlerware."
From a purely legal point of view, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Bikers, joggers and hikers were there yesterday at the 8th cycle on the Gro<0xC3><0x9F>e Feldberg and have thus supported the Association "Help for Cancerous Children".
The tour, which was torture for one, was an easy training for the other.
But they all agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski was supposed to have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberursel Brauhaus yesterday rode a bike on the Feldberg.
For the good cause.
He can easily get rid of the small musculoskeletal catheter, especially since his participation on the 8th wheel on the Gro<0xC3><0x9F>e Feldberg in favor of the Association "Help for Cancerous Children" (Frankfurt) has also personally brought him a valuable knowledge.
That's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do it - fine!"
Little puddles on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Upper Ursula City Parliament, many of the 718 participants climbed the mountain in the morning yesterday and came close to exhaustion, but happily on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the 11-kilometer long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Die<0xC3><0x9F>ner, for example.
The green politician from the circle – red dress, red bike – did something on understatement at the start (“Every lot of professionals, there’s a goal!”), but then turned out to be half a professional on the mountain and after 45 minutes passed without a breath.
He also went through the route in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press secretary of the city of Oberursel, who had set out together with Frank Gr<0xC3><0xBC>neisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we are happy to join - we would have made an exit today anyway," Kuhn said.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to climb back to the height.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung in the saddle at 9 a.m., "made" the Feldberg twice, then rolled home with fun.
It was also fun with Fritten-Toni.
For the head of the Oberursel Kultkiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply part of this.
He had scored 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilogram race bike.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious racer".
He must be, too, because he was on the road with the "Fixie wheel", although these are also racing wheels, but without circuitry...
Not only did the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the fox pole to the summit, but also a jogger who carried a car tire with weights behind him on a cord.
Mountain guard doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who provided safety with his team, equipped with all-wheel-bully and quad, said: "I know him" from Frankfurt, who is training for a special sledding trail, only that he is pulling the sled itself. So the man is, in a sense, his own sledding.
The 718 participants – and thus as many as never before – had been sent to the track in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers left.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Ride on the Big Feldberg", gave the starting commands and wished the participants a nice excursion.
For next year, he hopes that the route to Feldberg will be blocked for the safety of the participants.
