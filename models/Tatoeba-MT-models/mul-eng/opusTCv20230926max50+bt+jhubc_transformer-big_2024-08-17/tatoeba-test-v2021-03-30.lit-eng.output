Bettie always managed to get what she wanted.
You haven't told me anything?
Stay with me, ladies and gentlemen.

Hi. Hi.
Did Tom forgive you for what you did last week?
Good morning, time to wake up.
The baby was crying all night.
She doesn’t like living in the city.
This size is too big for me.
That won't change anything.
Do what you want.
The man you saw yesterday is my uncle.

You can’t eat anything sweet today.
She's eating.
I want to travel around the world.
Do you like the Italian language?
I was sentenced to five years in prison.

We didn't have to hurry.
Oh, please?
No matter which team wins the match.
He's running.
This dress is too big for me.

He was almost asleep.
I have one brother.
Why did you come here?

Millions of people lost their lives during the war.
Compare your sentence with that on the board.
She welcomed him with joy.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's message?
I don't like the way he speaks.
I no longer know what they are doing to me.
I learned a lot from him.
He killed that man.
Don’t wait too long.
That brown hat is old.
He plays golf every Sunday.
Be creative.
I couldn’t understand what he said.
Close the gate.

The girl I told you about lives here.
Please, just get out of here.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and see the black cat.
Her family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don't know whether to turn left or right.
I'll clean the kitchen later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I talked to my friends.
All your cats are gray.
I still remember those times when we were preparing a sunrise together with you.
When we go to sleep, we say "labanakt".
The scandal ruined his career.
Cats are complex individuals.
He was so poor that he could not buy bread.
I suggest you ask Tom.
This bag is not small.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you call him, he'll probably come.
I know that you know that I know.
Come home before six o'clock.
The bread is fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to be a bad guy anymore.

This is for us.
Listen to the radio.
The boy wants to know the truth.
Thomas ate the whole pizza alone.
You have to take care of yourself.
You need patience, Tom.
How'd you do?
Your journey begins here.
Can you believe what he said?
Tom asked where you were.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
He couldn’t stop thinking about Mary.
I think we need to call Tom.
Don't be late for the bus.
All the apples are there.
You have to pay.
When should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to the new store.
Everyone knows her.
She is incredibly naive.
Where do you live in Turkey?

Your watch is 10 minutes late.
They cheated on you.
I thought it was yours.

We have to get out of here.
Tom never wants to do it again.
I asked her to wait a minute.
How long have you been learning Esperanto?
They do not pose a threat.
Her advice encouraged me to go abroad.
You're the only one who can help me.
What places does this tour visit?
We started having a lot of sex, and that's why we played inside.
Your carpet is completely white.
But I don't want to.
I'm sorry I can't see you tonight.
Tom has a sister who is a lawyer.
I look like my mother.
You look just lovely tonight.
Doctor, can you hear me?
You understand, don't you?
I hope to see him on Monday.
Tom re-dressed.
The orcaite is hot, so be careful not to get thirsty.
Did you find your letters?
For the love of God!
I don’t know if the room was empty or not.
The store is selling expensive accessories to women.
I don't like being wrong.
It's not them.
I won't hesitate to get up early.
Wherever you are.
The house is hers.
The doctor advised him to stop working so much.
Are you sure?
You were busy.
I can no longer live like this.

I just want to talk.
What kind of music do you like?
The tree grows in her house.
Don’t talk in the reading room.
How are you doing, panel?
I would trade yen for dollars.
I hate the winter.
I think Tom's going to kill Mary.
There are only two correct answers.
If I had been rich, I would have given you some money.
When and where do you meet her?
Where did you fuck them?
Tom did not show up.
Don't be so serious, it's just a game.
He told a funny story.
I don't have time now.
Tom is the captain of our team.
This climb is very long.
Listen to what the teacher says.
Why is no one eating my potatoes?
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
What does that remind you of?
She literally translated it.
What a great night!
I can't find Timo.
She named him Charles.
I'm not sure if it's a boy or a girl.
Life is beautiful.
She takes them to school.

No one believed what you said.
I didn't know what to say.
Do you think I should go alone?
Just respond to the hearing.
I never want to be indebted to anyone.
Take a look at the train crossing the bridge.
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I'm really bored now.
No, I don't think I'm guilty.
Where are we?
I've been driving fifty.
Her flight seemed to be funny.
She's too young to understand.
I bought this dress just for this occasion.
It's similar.
Be careful, okay?
This is the only explanation.
I can't believe I'm actually here.
You don't know the way?
I really like that one.
Tom will need help.
I've printed a hundred pages.
I see and hear.
Don't forget the ticket.
Raise your hand before answering.
Please change the flag.
Isn't it true that you have a gun?
I was in bed all day yesterday.
The war ended their investigation.
When spring comes, the days become longer day by day.
I listen to the radio.
Sweet dreams!

The African dragons are larger than the Asian dragons.
What I always said.

If God did not exist, we would have to create Him.
You should do it yourself this time.

It has green eyes and light brown hair.
Does Thomas have experience?
She left her bed on the train.
I'm a vegetarian.
You definitely have to go there.
What's the reason?
I can't see anything from here.
When I didn’t get an answer, I wrote it again.
She's standing behind the wall.
Don't trust me too much.
They missed a great opportunity.
Fight for your rights.
He always talks to me when he meets me on the street.
Look at the book on the table.
I drank a beer and drank a lot.
Thomas did not think he needed a bodyguard.
Someone opened the door.
Do you have questions about this lesson?
We saw her walk into the park.
I don't seem to be busy.
It didn't look like you wanted that book.
I have a red bicycle.
It is low and thick.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The journey was exhausting.
He's a lot smarter than me.
Tom still doesn't seem interested.
The weather is terrible today.
I didn’t want this to happen.
The dog is trying to escape.
Like I said, I'm not going to do anything.
After that, there is a small brown puppy on the table.
Stop them.
She loves chocolate very much.
I know that Mike likes the basket.

Cupranugars are often used when traveling in the desert.
Mary is a bookie.
A good weekend.
I saw his car through the window.
Are you ready?
I'm glad they're not women.
Stop wasting your time and get back to work.
The more, the better.
Ten years is a long time.
Is this your car?
I can't believe you're still hungry.
Wanting to be happy is normal.
We need to move very carefully.
Did you get Tom's message?
Yesterday my hand hurt.
If I had been rich, I'd have given you some money.
I don't have a home computer.
My dad doesn’t eat a lot of fruit.
Can you give me a discount?
She kissed my cheek and wished me a good night.
My friend is here.
Where do you live now?
The older you are, the harder it is to learn a language.
Tom doesn't drink coffee, but he smokes cigarettes.
Not everyone likes dogs.
I'll be here for a few days.
I feel bad.
Why did you say such a stupid thing?
You can't beat me.
I don't think I could do that.
Is that really true?
She was crying.
We'll see hell.
He is my father.
He doesn't want to wait for you.
He took his family to the zoo.
Thomas refused to go to the hospital.
It's half nine.
This car was made in Japan.
Is this your first time in Japan?
Tony was happy.
My father asked me to open the door.
Make a photo robot!
Your brother wasn't in school today.
Tom will never disappoint you.
I was in Canada at the time.
I made this food myself.
Write with a pencil.
Someone wrote his name on the wall.
Anyone can go in the wrong direction and go in the wrong direction.
They no longer have sugar.
I love your daughter.
Tom will pretend that he won't eat the leftovers again tonight.
Someone opened the door.
I'm not your mother.
Why isn't Tom in the car?
My name is Ricardo.
When did you get the telegram?
You shouldn't be swimming in that pond.
When will the snow melt?
He thought I was very tired.
I don't think she wants to eat anymore.
You're either with us or against us.
Please help me, I'm dead!
Tom knows he likes Mary.
I like this music.
She's scared of the dog.
He went to the store, but stopped at her house.
The snow is fast.
We're asking here.
Of course, I should read this book.
Thomas is not currently in prison.
Tom and Mary went to the museum.
The ship went beyond the horizon.
Good morning, my dear dog.
God blesses those who repent.
I can't work when you're standing there.
Mary had problems with her lungs.
We were one big happy family.
What color car did you buy?
The child cried all night.
Can you see me?
She testified against him.
My father is growing rice.
We speak Japanese.
The result was disappointing.
I slipped through the window.
The meat is not ready yet.
Give me a piece of chalk.
She needs more sleep.
Did you hear anything?
Is she your mother?
Would you turn on the light?
He no longer trusts the doctor.
This was the first time I visited a museum.
We had a great time.
I think Tom will want to sit down.
What a great family.
Are you still living in Florida?
You didn't have to eat those green fish.
Get ready! Tomorrow is the last day.
We looked out the window, but didn’t see anything.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
The capital of Sweden is Stockholm.
They were talking about love.
Tom never wants to do it again.
I don't understand.
Left alone, the child would feel very lonely.
I don't know anything here.
Our team is lacking in mobility.
The cat crossed the street.
The mirror is a mirror.
Why don't you help the police?
I want to meet your father.
Please continue.
He was busy.
I'm a widow.
I saw him.
I'm teaching Lo<0xC5><0xBE>bano.
"Good morning," said Thomas, smiling.
You're hurting the ranch.
He needs stairs.
You shouldn't go.
You shouldn't trust him.
There are seven days in a week.
You have to choose your own way of life.
Without water and air, no one could live.
He slid and barely broke.
They work eight hours a day.
I ate better and better.
I do this every Sunday morning.
She quickly opened a letter.
Are you busy right now?
I accept everything I have said.
Where did you get all those keys?
I walked in through the window.
Take Tom to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He quickly wrote down our names.
Our son died during the war.
He is unhappy with the result.
Of course you're wrong.
I can't say who's coming first.
I don't want to talk to you because you broke my heart.
Don't trust him.
<0xE2><0x99><0xAA> We may as well all go <0xE2><0x99><0xAA>
Who is this person sitting at the other end of the table?
This idea is very attractive.
They're going shopping.
Everything that is genius is simple.
The students learn too much.
Tom raised his hand.
Let's go to lunch.
The birds fly out to the south.
This tea is very tasty.
I disagree with him.
I'm guilty.
Not bad, but I'm a little tired.
This is a wonderful idea.
He is very proud of his toy.
That's enough for us so far.
I'm not scared at all.
A woman wants to know the truth.
Is this word often used?
Lithuania is entering the European Union.
I want to be a speaker.
Where is the cat?
I'm sorry for what I did.
She has become a patron.
I learned to ride a bike when I was six.
He took out a piece of chalk.
Let me do this.
I like jazz.
I'm sure he's innocent.
Open the window and let in the fresh air.
Have you ever put a finger on it?
It's snowing hard.
Have you seen my mother?
I know his name.
Tom doesn't want to live like that.
Do you agree with what she does?
He came here before the end of the lesson.
Do you know their address?
What the hell are you doing?
He looked down at his dirty shoes.
Her cat lay on my pillow and did not want to fall.
There are several good hotels in the city.
Why this letter?
He doesn’t want to study today.
We are all different.
You don't know how much I love you.
I wrote her a long letter.
He couldn’t do what he wanted.
I feel a little weak today.
Life is interesting.
She's here?
I don't like being wrong.
Be careful, okay?
I bought a camera for $30.
Here's the guy.
It's a method, it's a provocation.
Answer in English.
He wants to see us again.
The water here is very shallow.
Where do you live?
My friend doesn't use sugar.
I fell off the stairs.
He can teach people.
Bob was washing dishes at the time.
My brother is two years older than me, but he is three centimeters lower than me.
I can only tell you what I know.
I'm thinking of you.
What is your home address?
Tomorrow it will be free.
Have you seen my wife?
Your daughter heard us talking.
Tom will soon die.
I'm used to going to bed late.
I've met him before.
Look at that house with a red roof.
My apartment is on the fourth floor.
She was already pregnant.
We are basketball players.
These clothes suit you.
Don't blame them.
Do you know that you are stronger than you think?
I love her so much that I can't leave her.
Can you come with us?
I don't care.
Thomas could not find the reason why he had to return home early.
Raise your hand.
He did not sell the house.
No one has ever seen God.
She saw something waiting for her at school.
I don't seem to be busy.
Where's Maria?
The new contract allows us to demand whatever we want.
Tom is still a prisoner.
Go and open the door.
I said I'd call each of them later.
God, help me!
She told him she was happy.
He needs her more than he needs her.
Interesting exits!
Tom, I'm back.
You wanted to see me?
This is not a mistake.
The airport is quite far from the city center.
You can turn off the radio now.
You can turn off the radio now.
You are a very kind person.
Ankara is in Turkey.
You're a very nice person.
I have been to Boston several times.
You are a very nice person.
