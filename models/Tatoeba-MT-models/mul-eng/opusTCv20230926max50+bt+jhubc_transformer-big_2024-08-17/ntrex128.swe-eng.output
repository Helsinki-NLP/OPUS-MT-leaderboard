AM in Wales is concerned about “promising as a puckon”
Some AM, members of the National Assembly of Wales, are confused about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The proposal is planned to change the name of the National Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
AM across the political spectrum is concerned about being ridiculed.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who can't Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means badass.
An AM for Plaid said the group was generally "dissatisfied" and has proposed other options.
A conservative Welshman said his group was "open" to the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is pronounced in Welsh like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation for the name change, said: "The final decision on what members of the Assembly are to be called is so clear up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly of Wales Parliament.
The current title for AM was proposed by the Commission by Welsh Parliament Members (members of the Welsh Parliament) or WMP, but MWP was most supported in a public consultation.
AM apparently suggests other options, but problems with reaching a consensus may cause problems for President Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The legislation for the amendments also includes other amendments to the way the assembly works, including rules for disqualification of an AM and the design of the committee system.
AM is allowed to vote on what to call them when they debate the legislation.
Macedonia is holding a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the name change and has said he will miss the result.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's are silent when the churches of Harlem encounter problems
“Older people I’m talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before,” Mr Adams said.
"Now there is neither."
He said it was understandable that the bars would disappear.
“People are getting along in different ways now,” he said.
“Bars are no longer like the area’s living room, where people go on a regular basis.”
Regarding the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough as leaders expect and that " sooner or later they will end up on the route again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with people who do not help the remaining churches.
“The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in buildings will be white,” he said. “This will eventually lead to all churches being closed, because those who move into apartments probably won’t become members of the churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin’s was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, which refused to employ or promote black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson’s congregation planned the renovation, they also built the clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, Johnson's father's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the music game "the watches of the poor".
The expert who played the clock game in July had a different name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world’s first clock game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the biggest clock game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
The events of recent months at St. Martin’s are a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs – some employed by the church’s laymanship, others by the episcopal foundation.
The church assembly – the church’s governing body consisting of laymen – wrote to the foundation in July and expressed concern that the foundation would “try to transfer the cost” to the church assembly, even though the church assembly had not been involved when the foundation hired architects and contractors.
Some members of the congregation complained of a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Shark injures 13-year-old diving for lobster in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who appeared after lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he initially believed that the boy was only happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that the entire key legs had worn out.
"I called everyone to get out of the water. 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel said.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is stated to be critical.
It is not clear what the damage was.
Swimmer Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said the victim suffered trauma to his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami’s in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is entering the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-like beauty rides with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household market, the major beauty trends will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the quick-buyer’s attempt to fill the shelves previously taken up by TVs, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s said it plans to double its beauty range to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing offerings from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with marked areas, such as in stores like Boots.
The store chain also re-launches its boutique make-up brand so that most of the products are vegan – which more and more young customers demand.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test booths at two Sainsbury’s stores – the first booth opened in Croydon, South London last week and the second one opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend of buying smaller amounts of food every day in local stores means that quick purchases need to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, has said that their stores will look more and more like department stores in an attempt to combat cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury’s has Argos-stands in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat-stands since they bought both chains two years ago, which they say has increased food sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempt to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how the proceeds from Boots' sales in the supermarket would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They argue that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial manager, said: “We have given our beauty salons a new look and feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can give customers advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an appealing environment in agile locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'raised' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is "racing" that TV presenter Holly Willoughby is pulling out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not find their brand Truly, with casual clothing and accessories.
Their business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop.
This morning the presenter, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute – to focus on their new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "racing" at a thrilling meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new deal — worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million — meant that she no longer focused on their brand of clothing, clothing, and clothing.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she was leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was clearly Holly's top priority.
That would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to leave shocked everyone who was involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a stock full of goods ready for sale at Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that the decision of the This Morning presenter to withdraw could cost the company several million due to significant investments in everything from pillows and lights to clothes as well as the risk of further delays in the launch.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-year-old mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role of chairman in March.
The couple are vacationing together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host for "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
Tough talk "and then we fell in love"
He joked that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider to be “unworthy a president” and for being so positive about North Korea’s leaders.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "newspaper vote":
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He said Kim wants a second meeting after Trump hailed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea’s nuclear arsenal.
However, negotiations on nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore meeting in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “response” from the United States following North Korea’s first disarmament step.
He noted that the United States, instead, continues sanctions designed to maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his supporters.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have a great relationship.”
He said his attempt to improve relations with Kim has had positive results – an end to missile tests, freed the hostages and left the remains of U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this packed arena, we’d have about 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy island in Indonesia, hundreds die
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had lost their homes, it was not declared a state of emergency, which is required for international assistance.
“In many cases, they have unfortunately been very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, which complicates the whole process,” Ms Sumbang said.
Rescue children gather a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign personnel can work there.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the agency, said Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the aid work.
In view of Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, the country is still woefully unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Tsunami protection has been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite a warning being issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters complicate logistics even more.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days for it to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the promises to improve Indonesia’s worn infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and rails.
But poor funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration in the run-up to next year's election.
Mr. Joko is also pressured by the lingering sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, arrow arches and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge conceded last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team was 1-0 behind.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick towards the far pole.
The attempt flew high over the target area towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga's hopes and ended up in the net.
"I was just trying to get into a position to get to the ball and players like Shaq are always playing as much forward as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and didn't think much about it, I just kicked."
Chelsea led 1-0 after the first half after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker handed a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spun off near the centrefield and sprinted to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at midfield.
Then he got a sovereign kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran away from the defence and got the ball in the net at the far pole with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will compete against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 3 p.m. on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country’s disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were reported to have stuck in the rubble of buildings razed in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The town of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was full of rush from buildings that raged.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with a knife wound on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I'm asking anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is critical to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman who was found was living in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police will inform the victim's immediate relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but police said no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He became aimless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it will take several hours before they can enter again.
A police assistant told a man that the whole area is being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She says "it's so horrible" over and over again.
At 14:00 there were two police cars inside the lock and another one just outside.
A number of police assistants were present before the lockdown with an overview of the apartment building.
People with information are asked to send a DM to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell latest victim of plot to rewrite history
A ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "madness" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be dragged into the ongoing debate about removing statues.”
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Cromwell may have been sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the 19th-century view of and is part of the historiography of a man who many consider should still be revered.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, consider that Cromwell defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case from the monarchy.
Whether this is a correct representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has undoubtedly affected our nation’s development, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the issue.
His business as Lord Protector also deserves to be celebrated and celebrated.
M<0xC3><0xB6>rdargris kills farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a busted artery and covered in blood in a path on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject the vaccine into pigs in a piggy bank on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby piggy bank was open.
He said there was a big pig in the pig with blood on his mouth.
A technical investigation confirmed that the 250-pound pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and twisted,” the cousin identified with the surname Wu told Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid further attacks while police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and those responsible for the market are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It is rare for pigs to attack people, but it has happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and inflicted serious injuries on the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig pressed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "catalyst".
“They’re just playful.
They're nauseous and very curious, and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect,” he said.
The Remains of Hurricane Rosa for Widespread Heavy Rain to the Southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it travels over cooler waters off Mexico’s northern coast.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind speed of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture that interacts with the coming drought will create widespread heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5–10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, mudflows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5–7.5 cm of rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5–10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwestern United States, especially in much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that anyone venture into the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into pouring rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around the sand.
The approaching tremor brought some local heavy rain to parts of Southern California’s coastline.
It is possible with a total over a cm of rain, which can lead to mudflows and slippery roads.
It would be the first rain in the area during the rainy season.
Some rocky tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
October could mean intense temperature changes across the U.S., when the Arctic cools down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
There are nearly ten degrees difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October with around 30 degrees from the Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York could get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be around five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high chance of warmer temperatures than the average in the Eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 Million Watched Brett Kavanaugh's Interview
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's arresting testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock and normal broadcast were halted for Friday’s last minute-twist – Arizona Senator Jeff Flake’s deal with the FBI where they were given a week to investigate the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is absolutely sure that Kavanaugh teased her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million indicated by Nielsen.
They counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available to other TV networks that showed the interview, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people looking from the office.
By comparison, there are as many spectators as there are for a football match in the final game or the Oscars gala.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh’s nomination, had the most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long interview, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the second highest number of viewers with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the interview.
Flake was in the spotlight during Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed protesters shouting at him as he tried to take an elevator to an interview with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down at the floor for several minutes while the protesters yelled at him, as shown in a live broadcast by CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, “You have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed, he said he would have more to say after the inquiry with the committee.
The TV network broadcast live hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted on whether to move Kavanaugh’s nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said he was only going to do so if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the nominee over the coming week, which the minority Democrats have called for.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘political games’ about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about Britain's future and undermine the nation's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s customs duties was “completely unreasonable.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspected Dyteon Simpson for LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for murder, police in Baton Rouge said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted that he killed Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish judge released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and into the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police’s escape team, the police’s state law lab, Southern University’s police and residents of the area for help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their “frustration and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-meter-long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crossed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're worried about this all the time," Wade said.
Volcano asks ash over Mexico City
Ashes from the volcano Popocatépetl have reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity had been detected in the crater and they recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several mules and shells.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on windscreens in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with demand police, while thousands took part in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back by demand police threw eggs and color powder on them, leading to dark dust clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Battle targets broke out later in the day and police used their batons to stop them.
For several hours, the independence groups shouted "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists shouted "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests, according to local press.
The situation is still tense in the region, which yearns for independence after the referendum on the first October, which was considered illegal by Madrid but was hailed by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted for independence, but the turnout was low when most opposed to secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but was forced to take a different route.
The electrician Narcis Termes, 68, took part in the separatist protest with his wife and said he no longer believes Catalonia will become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out for joy in being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal gain in regional elections in December, Catalan parties who are for independence have had a hard time keeping the momentum up this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-imposed exile or are incarcerated awaiting trial for their own role in the organisation of the referendum and the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his mobile, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more exciting," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been incarcerated since the end of last year, announced that he is planning to run for the European Parliament next year.
“Applying to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the subjugation we have experienced from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car drove into house
Three men – 33, 34 and 39 – have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
A wristband may also have been fired at the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston shocked the Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was split second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side has still not won a away win in the Premiership this season and will face Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his winning streak to six games – head coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is missing opportunities for visitors.
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they made goals; their fairness gave Rangers all possible problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dropped his performance across the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot wide after slipping in to measure Craig Halkett's nicking across the goal.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could attack in certain games.
And that’s how the crucial goal was made.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston used an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a chance, which made goals from the middle of the goal area.
In that situation, Rangers had dominated the ball, but the home team's defense was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely left in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Ranger goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings constantly came into Livingston’s target area and were handled without problems. Two criminal claims – after Halkett’s challenge by exchangeer Glenn Middleton and one for hand – were dismissed.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their playing style and staff have barely changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt deserves the honor of having galvanized the team since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skillfully organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on full-scale straight through.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball didn’t have to – they only opened the home page once – and that’s something of a Rangers wake-up call, which is in the middle.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday offered smiles and blue skies (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – which will repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have become wary of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world’s largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police said they prevented 25,000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurdish – also made their voices heard and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dueling protests show the split views of a visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and condemned as a monopolist by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist has died in a crash with a car in London.
The crash took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-trafficed road in Deptford in south-east London, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped the car and the nurse was called there, but the man died on the spot.
The crash takes place a few months after another cyclist died in a contagion accident on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads have been blocked and buses have been diverted and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Sex guards injured in riot
Six prison guards have been injured in concerns at a high-security men's prison, according to the Prison Office.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialized "tower guards" have been called there to deal with the concerns, which involve eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated on site for minor damage to the face.
A spokesperson for Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been sent there to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those behind this will be referred to the police and may receive extended prison sentences.”
HMP Long Lartin holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the demand police were called to the prison to deal with serious unrest where personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (areas with drought may benefit)
It’s rare that tropical lows reach Arizona, but that’s just what’s likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy pulls out across the desert in the southwestern United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix said in a tweet that only "twenty tropical cyclones have maintained status as tropical storms or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5–10 cm of rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to experience 2.5–5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without the risk of sudden flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but part of the rain will probably be useful because the southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa will first travel across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum wind strength of 135 km/h, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm hits cooler water in the Pacific Ocean, calming it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico’s land mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can get heavy rain, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
“A total of 7.5–15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm,” weather.com reported.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States,” said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and mudflows in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed what happened to the phone to step forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh "led, disgusted, angry" from Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s recklessness and outrageous tactics,” Trump told his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffering from the disgust, anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually assaulted her decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in front of Congress about his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and the quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public,” he told his audience in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
“We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
“I’m not running, but I’m running,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going around and fighting for sovereign candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats are trying to “resist and prevent.”
The first crucial vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of people killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number rises
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when giant waves crashed into the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six meters high waves crashed against the beach in the shade, sweeping many to a safe death and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stopped at the beach instead of immediately running away from there, and they fell victim to the tsunami," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster agency BNPB, said at a meeting in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was not alone but dragged cars, warehouses and houses. It affected everything in its path," Nugroho said. He also said that the tsunami had been traveling in the open sea for up to 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed up trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Aftershocks still hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia’s Bureau of Evaluation and Application of BPPT Technology said in a statement that the amount of energy released in Friday’s huge earthquake was 200 times as large as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as “comprehensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found during the rush of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the victims and injuries could be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication from Donggala "was completely neglected without any information," Nugroho said.
“There are over 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” they said.
The agency was criticised on Saturday for not informing it that the tsunami had hit Palu, but authorities said the waves had appeared within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man upstairs in a building is heard screaming frenetic warnings about the tsunami to people on the street below.
Within a few minutes a wall of water crashes towards the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to an extensive power outage that disrupted all communications around Palu, making rescue work more difficult for the authorities.
The military has begun sending cargo flights from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city’s airport has been opened for assistance and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Employees from World Vision in Donggala have taken to Palu where they are seeking protection during presentations on the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the way, according to Mr Doseba.
“They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have started the rapid relief work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and employees from abroad may only be used if an emergency permit is declared after a disaster.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a regional disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the authorities say that it is a national disaster, we can release international assistance, but that status has not yet been declared.”
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing persons were still hoping that their loved ones would turn out to be the miracles that light up dark natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped in a hurry for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, Indonesia’s national flight coach, had trained two of the missing flight attendants before the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
“As a screen flight veteran, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr Gendon said that hours after the on-screen pilots heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages only got one gray bump, instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thief Takes $26,750 During Bankruptcy Charge at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, $26,750 was stolen from a Brink's co-worker who filled a ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from police in Newport.
The driver of the car had emptied a ATM in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, criminal Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While busy, he "jumped up another man behind Brink's co-worker" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
The witnesses saw several suspected escapees from the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators should contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday, saying, "The creature that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title of their eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande in the program, who set up "emotional reasons" according to the program's creator.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am we, it is we.
It went from Kanye, which means ‘the one’, to just Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of well-known rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with West, has previously written his name with and without lines and verses.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexico’s newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to use the military against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Troops fired guns at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 600 people during an era when left-wing student movements broke out in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans with monthly contributions to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and poor educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double AI funding
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on field research, according to inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government have made statements about AI, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an overall formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
A double budget can double the chance of the next major AI breakthrough being made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published earlier this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranking American Othello player, and later he headed Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google’s China division.
Lee mentioned previous technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as the Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what the next would be in order to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes the academic leaders from us, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired leading personalities from universities to work at AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the United States with AI innovation.
“I think that green cards should be offered automatically to PhD students in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China issued its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation provides grants to individuals at academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distributing money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
U.S. legislation that would create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonia's referendum on name change
Macedonia's population voted in a referendum on Sunday if the country's name is to be changed to "North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has prevented the country's attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbour in the north is a requirement on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the name change would undermine Macedonia’s Slavic majority identity.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he does not intend to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubt whether the minimum participation of 50 percent required for the referendum to be considered valid will be achieved.
The question on the ballot in the referendum is: “Are you for membership in NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?”
But supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is worth changing its name if it does so that Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia split, can join the EU and NATO.
“I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough members of Parliament have said that they intend to follow the outcome in order for it to be seen as decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority of parliament.
According to the State Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 1 p.m.
But the turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election of 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the Macedonia referendum on the country's name change, which would open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia 30 September 2018.
Outside the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, arranged a small stage and exhibited chairs in front of the tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with the head in the air, not sneak in through the back door,” Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, a NATO membership would lead to much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
“I think the absolute majority will vote yes, because over 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said a “yes” result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Police Investigation, between 30 and 43 percent of voters thought of voting in the referendum, which falls during the minimum required participation.
According to another survey carried out by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of participants expected to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them voted yes.
In order for the referendum to be counted, 50 percent of registered voters must have one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious setback for the Western-oriented government policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero takes on Brighton's entire defence to score goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian striker received a pass from the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and went out on the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He walked around a defender and ran away from several others at the edge of Brighton's goal area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forward used his first kick in the goal area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial takeover in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's infield on that game.
He sent off a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the far pole.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net the moment before it ended up out of reach.
City meet Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the final game, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But competition-oriented Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, which is a match ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still have a chance at the final game.
The Rockies got a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking for their first division title.
“We’re playing about nothing, but we can get a chance to rub the rubber in knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the other team would play at a higher level than any other team I would face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to be there?”
The Nationals have not announced their start for Sunday yet, but according to reports, they are leaning toward letting Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day.
Washington's right-hand thrower is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump speaks in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he spoke about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the upcoming midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ... I don’t run, but I run. That’s why I go around and fight for sovereign candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see a terrible, terrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever is required, you see their cowardice, their cowardice.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We're not going to let them get it."
Democrats, he said, are fighting to “resist and prevent.”
“You’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and ugly and terrible and false.”
He mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, as noted by a high-profile audience.
“Do you remember what she said?
“Did you miss the document?”
'Eh, eh, huh?
No, no, no, I’m waiting for a...” It was really bad body language, something of the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don’t tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last in a row MP from Labour who gets to hear that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, about the security of the nation, about Europe – ironically, similar topics that Jeremy criticized former leaders for.
The announcement of the meeting with Nottingham East Labour on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be welcoming and productive".
For most of my eight years as Labour’s local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been just that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of a "friendly, gentler" policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever even began.
It has become increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated within Labour, and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party leader accepts it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I previously believed had a similar political view that I expected to make a full reversal and take positions that I would otherwise never have held – whether it was about the security of the nation or the internal market of the European Union.
Every time I speak in public – and it really doesn’t matter what I say – I follow a bunch of people on social media who demand that I be deposed, criticize my policies and say that I shouldn’t even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just affect me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues when faced with a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments with this era's policy is the level of insults now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality, we are no longer this broad church, and with every act of distrust and change of the rules of selection, the party is becoming more and more narrow.
I’ve received a lot of advice over the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too far ahead, so “get it right.”
But that’s not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a school life 32 years ago, provoked by Thatcher’s government neglect that literally made my elementary school classroom fall apart, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both locally and as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, and that includes the latest election.
No one in Nottingham East can in any way have been confused by my views on policies and topics where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those of you who promoted the application on Friday, I just want to say that when the country goes against a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour party leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threat to settle down or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayr on top
Two attempts at the last minute may have distorted the result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this delightfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They are now at the top, the only unbeatable side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave the home team the win, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested during our matches so far and are still unbeaten, so we're obviously happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, which was converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a 17-5 lead on the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was then a long wait for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was barred by the plan, and after the restart, Ayr increased the lead again with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, who was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty line out behind Ayr's maul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent away flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he has been appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duon has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the end of the series, and Kiernan seems to plan for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a source on the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan would enter Glasgow's "flowering restaurant industry".
“The sea belongs to us”: Coastless Bolivia hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific again
Sailors patrol a rig-covered headquarters for the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
The fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it.”
In coastal Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still strong – and that is also the desire to sail again on the Pacific.
This hope is higher than in decades now when Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on the first of October, after five years of consideration.
“Bolivia has the drive, an atmosphere of unity and peace, and so clearly awaits the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the international court on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will judge in favor of Bolivia’s demands that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, have to negotiate with Bolivia to allow them a separate outlet to the sea.
Monday’s decision is also of great importance to Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president who faces a controversial re-election campaign next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think it’s incredible that the court will judge Bolivia’s favor, and that not much would change even if it does.
The United Nations Court of Justice, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to assign Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision was announced only six months after the final arguments suggested that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have hurt rather than boosted Bolivia’s chances.
“The issue of access to the sea has been covered by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She claims that Morales' aggressive rhetoric has tarnished Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, did not consider that the court’s decision had been taken unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an outstanding opportunity to launch a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "stop 139 years of differences of opinion with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he said.
“The decision is a chance to realize that we have to move on from the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Weapons Requires Confidence in U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says the nation will not downgrade its nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resolving the deadlock in nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “desire” to continue sanctions and U.S. protests against a statement that ending the Korean War will ever tame North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first initiating significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want one more summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang really intends to get rid of a weapons arsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge headlines on their way to stores near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of crisp, oversized headbands for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which blended the style icons at Paris Fashion Week.
Incredibly impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent away their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino’s main creation was an exaggerated beige hat with a feather-like wide hat board that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-enriched watermelons, a wizard hat and even an pineapple – but they are not meant to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, in good time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had hopped lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creature resembled a wet suit with snorkel and diving mask, and another looked like a melted glass straw.
And if you continue the enormous courage, you are in luck.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hitters may be on their way to stores near you.
The oversized hats come right after La Bomba – the 60 cm straw hat that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out another big creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that held it.
The raffia bag in the terracotta, with raffi fringes and a white leather handle, excelled in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris fashion week.
Famed fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags in stores next summer – the designer has had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Key Language Skills for Global Citizens
Scotland’s independent schools retain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding test results, which are only strengthened by individual and collective progress in sports, arts, music and other community engagements.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As a training sector that can design and implement customized curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and in demand topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
It’s a powerful reminder that we can’t just rely on English when we build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that language is at the top of the list, with the highest number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final Higher Grade exam.
Data, collected from SCIS 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students who studied Mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Language as subject selection is now considered to be as important as natural knowledge, technology, engineering and mathematics on curricula in independent schools and beyond.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills 2014 found that employers for various reasons had difficulty filling their vacancies, with 17% attributed to a lack of language skills.
With that said, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills are becoming necessary in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a competitive advantage to a multilingual person.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adults published by YouGov in 2013, 75 percent responded that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and there French was the only language that totaled a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
That is why it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, each school will learn different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in languages considered to be most important for the UK by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds on to.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly the language that continues to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to watching LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday’s first season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been determined.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Laker's official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is making his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five scheduled performances over the next week, including events at places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Waiting for a confirmation vote of his candidate for the Supreme Court’s vacant post, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the run-up to the November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia campaign events are scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week’s inquiry by the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense after accusations of his sexual abuse, with an expected delay of the Senate vote of up to a week while the FBI’s investigation of the case is underway.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help Republicans get some meat on their feet before the November election.
Thus, President Trump said that these five meetings next week aim to "engage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
“Controlling Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period,” a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be named told Reuters.
Tonight’s event, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, may draw fans from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh’s media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to come there to try to give him an increase in opinion polls,” said Simon Haeder, a senior scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA fights to keep hopes alive in front of Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon matches could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The moment’s swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before competitions like these.
So what momentum is this about now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so we wear it like a little momentum I guess,” Jordan Spieth said when he finished for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have little wind in their sails, but they have a lot to encourage, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and came home three points out of four each.
Spieth has been wet from tea to green and goes by a good example.
The win went even higher as his round went on and he lowered a decisive putt to take the match four all-square when he and Thomas had lay behind with two after two games.
His putt that won them the match at 15 met with a similar roar, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
“You really have to dig deep and worry about your own match,” Spieth said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to win.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup’s undisputed story.
Europe’s odd but adorable couple are four out of four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These achievements and audience reactions state that they are the players to beat on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could come home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process brief with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine lowered the Spaniard and the Swedes into a hole they never even came close to crawling out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of the hole.
Foursome and foursome are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a significant lead before the final day but this four-season also showed that Team USA has a fighting spirit that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in the Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage at the Ryder Cup last day after coming out of Saturday's foursomes match with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins over a besieged Tiger Woods and came home four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who fought to keep the cup they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that never really got started during the morning's match with 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursome and won two matches, but it was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball, they beat an exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more oppressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, tested at a time of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-ball and four-seater, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning's match and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and third in the world.
Europe had not winded all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They came home the win with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit in the singles, however Furyk's side only needs a draw to keep the trophy.
After being second best for two days, it looks like a counterattack on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says it will “never” disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continuing sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and it was not possible for the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that over the past year, North Korea had taken “significant measures to show its goodwill,” for example, by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear weapons testing facilities, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons.
“We don’t see a similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to an approach divided into stages for the nuclear power that would lead to North Korea being rewarded when it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, as it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution previously made as such.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work towards "dealing nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. has said Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also declined negotiations to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘dealing first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion and even appeals against the ‘declaration of ending the war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can get us on our knees is a wishful thinking for those people who lack knowledge about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that U.S. leaders highlighted at the U.N. earlier this week.
The minister instead pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korea’s leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the party in this matter were South Korea and not the United States, the Korean peninsula’s nuclear weapons would not have come to such a dead end.”
Yet the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different than last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s future ability to reach the U.S. mainland with missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missileman” on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, thanked Kim for his courage to take action for disarmament, but it said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeframe for this and said that “if it takes two years, three years or five months,” it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the maintenance of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue with force and without failure until we realize a complete, final, verified disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to suspend the financing of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea accused him a few hours later of making "gangster-like demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear power complex if the United States took "responsive measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and is moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year has led all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-filled "durings".
An academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often clueless about the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
“At the end of it a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why can’t I know this until now, during my last year?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep – which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organized for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course includes a range of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants will learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students directly.
But we think they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in that “dignity” still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in a state of starvation and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has read one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before starting their studies at the high-performing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to lie down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn on the clock, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal lowers Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to take home their first win on the road since February 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga beat to seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers never managed to equalize the result.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be more problems on the slopes for Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence was forced to be treated for a main year after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his well-killed game overt opponents each time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been two minutes into the match when Menga's first pass passed Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then reached team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the rear pole.
The Rangers took control of the match, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game during the final third of the match.
Alfredo Morelo felt sure that he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian’s appeal.
Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily received Lassana Coulibaly's nick and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Liv's opening shot in the 34th minute must have gone against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their knockout deserved it.
Once again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's permanent situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher matched Scott Robinson, who stayed calm and chose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the switch gave almost immediate effect when the outside hit the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get the opponents to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up a long pass after a long pass.
Holt's side could have strengthened his lead in the final stage, but McGregor managed well to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow knocked out the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had yet another late demand for punishment when he was beaten with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manic called Geiger Meter.
Geiger meters have become a cornerstone of science since then and are also major figures in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly unlikely cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
“What in the world is that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger gauge, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Yes, it's popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to Recognize Cancer Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-inject
A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various forms of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer,” explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was kicked out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a waning performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song for the night, called Ghost Town in which he wore a Make America Great cap, he rallied against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“So many times when I talk to a white person they say, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on the allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's exposure was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to run West with the post.
West had also complained to the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his headband.
"They've been harassing me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I dropped low," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to sink down too?" and said that he would "put on my supermancape, because that means you can't say what I'm allowed to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
“Test with love.”
His comments attracted more bureaups at least twice from the audience, and employees from SNL found the generated, Variety reported. One person said: "There was a death row in the studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with his appearance of the song I Love it, dressed in a Perrier bottle.
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU TO STAND ON YOUR MOBILE."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West simply "was himself and it's absolutely wonderful."
“But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) that I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
That's what we do, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "the creature formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper's colleague, Snoop Dogg, has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Sentences for attempted murder after knife-cutting at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendants are expected to appear at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the prosecutor’s office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington hits toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wrenching role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something has gone wrong” and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, acknowledged that he feels "quite strong" to deal with the problem.
“I personally feel pretty strong, right now – where have we gone wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that TV may be partly responsible for the increase of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characteristics.
He continued, “What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they have to be in a certain way to be a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
It’s clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones sequels when the series comes to an end next summer and says he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife thanks to the series, so that’s how it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, whom Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love with, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, the health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted via sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV infection by association is an urgent issue in China’s HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men sooner or later will marry women.
Many of the cases of infection are due to insufficient protection when combined in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicine as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking GOP senator's data, blames "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that one of her employees had posted personal data to three Republican U.S. senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these claims were spread by right-wing extremist websites.
"Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers to Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online Thursday, filed by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel inquiry into the allegations of sexual assault against the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water’s office and released the information about a member of Water’s staff, Hill reported.
“This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - were not in any way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded statement is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Water’s statement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They shall not question the applicant’s motives.
They need to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of having seemed angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran for Waters in the middle of his term, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great to be true," he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her office had warned "appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed,” she continued, “and that they will be held legally responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees.”
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - Powerless Spy Parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit meanings in every new British-led film, and the same seems to apply to this re-recording of the latest Johnny English action comedy - a series of spy parodies that was launched in 2003 with Johnny English and revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will we be satisfied with how obviously bad we are to become the nation’s new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has been given his license to tap into the case renewed for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation intended for the bio public even in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the tricky secret agent, who despite his bizarre claims to smoothieglamour has gotten a little bit of Clouseau, a snitch Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There's one or two good moments in the latest JE movie
I loved when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor blades briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy appears, but humor feels rather low-key and strangely superfluous, especially as the “serious” film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
Humor feels like it’s adapted for kids instead of adults and for me, Johnny English’s weird obsessions are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film cousins in the role of Bean.
The current issue is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all UK agents out in the field, to the agent in the service’s great dissatisfaction – an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and hard-working figure, already suffering from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the script does not offer much to work with.
Her intelligence advisor informs her that when each active spy is busy, she must use someone who retired.
And that means the native Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in any well-trained institution, but offering unofficial lessons in the art of working undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former long-lived sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submariner, a jolly-hockey-sticks role where Vicki Pepperdine is close to being discarded.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so horribly wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service and encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister will fall hard for the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain’s computer mess: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of father-in-law obsessions: dressed in waiters, they set fire to a flamboyant French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but despite the fact that the film is both charming and fast-paced, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Quite moderately everything like everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies drafting a plan for Britain to work a four-day week but get pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that says the British are working a four-day week — but get paid for five.
The party wants corporate leaders to hand over savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but retain the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda in favor of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by trade union organization Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior Labor representative told The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen in a day, but a four-day workweek is an effort that fits into the party’s attitude to balance the economy in favor of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, including the Greens party that promised a four-day workweek during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this objective is not covered by Labour as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day work week is not the party’s policy and it’s not something the party agrees on.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless leaders” and “sniffers” at government companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot get back their entire effort, as a Labour government can make "deductions" because of what they perceive to have been wrong actions.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on corporate boards and create the so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10% of the private company’s equity is transferred to its employees, who then stand to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on the TV show "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI’s investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency’s investigations could cause any Republican senators to change their position on the matter.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would lead to them changing their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the claim came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, convinced, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, seems impolite.
“I’ve already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite lawsuit,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all her names couldn’t verify it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features a hugely impressive roster of performing stars and an equally impressive mission; to fight world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Park’s Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival is, according to a 2012 statement, an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you weren’t ready to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or otherwise meaningfully helping raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called “clickivism” – people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen reports that more than 19 million “actions” have been recorded by its supporters who fought for a variety of goals.
It states that these measures have contributed to spurring world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or funded.
The group estimates that the assets collected so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership between investors and stakeholders committed to “helping children develop to their full potential,” promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustice as malnutrition is a footnote in history,” said Ullman to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken that required the UK to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced funding of the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes diet programs targeting 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the common questions on his website: "What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen replied: “There will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists performing at this year’s New York event, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports, Interior Minister says
The government can "if necessary" attack its fleet to prevent Russian energy operators from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s commitment to Syria – especially where it is acting on the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think they’re in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe,” he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the ability to, with our fleet, ensure that the sea lanes are kept open and, if necessary, apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are really the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “daylander” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements will come after the Trump administration has aimed to increase the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington’s resistance to the project is only driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was backed by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I strongly dislike a third party disrupting our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "ordinary thinker" if she is to stand in the 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take a "regular thinker" about her participation in the presidential election after the U.S. midterm election.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running as a candidate.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
"After November 6, I will take a serious thinker to run for president."
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the city council meeting and said that he “taken this country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A vote released on Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren’s own supporters did not believe she would run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of “probable” Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy by former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed regarding a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking office in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday evening.
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through now when he’s back, I can relate to other families who have experience of PTSD and part of the trauma our soldiers return with,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his grip “the elephant in the room” and said of his son and other war veterans that “they come back like other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have given the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, attempting to prevent a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, as well as the District of Columbia support the questioning of a new asylum policy
Arton states and the District of Columbia support a legal trial aimed at a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The U.S. attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed a 2014 decision by immigration authorities that allowed illegal immigrants to seek asylum to escape domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed based on specific facts and circumstances that apply to the claim, and such a provision violates that principle,” according to the friend-of-the-court report.
Lawyers further claimed in the report that policies that deny immigrants’ entry hurt the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “deliver the necessary labor.”
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political opinion,” Sessions said when the policy was announced on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation seemed increasingly gloomy.
“It feels very exciting,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who comforted her frail boy at an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
“The ambulance picks up dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a deficiency.”
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, rotting through water-damaged possessions and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were damaged in the 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's Army Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong aftershocks.
With tearful eyes, he said the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t run away.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “bullying” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily paying a supplement to the Des Moines Register — Iowa’s best-selling newspaper — after accusing China of trying to participate in the U.S. 6th congressional election, something China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington aimed at putting pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with high tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s tariffs were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that support Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “now doubles the bullying by posting propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“The Chinese government is using America’s cherished tradition of free speech and a free press to spread propaganda to by publishing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing, you will find a limited number of dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the various views that the Chinese people may have about China’s troubled economy, as the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party’s iron fist,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers pushed the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare away female voters ahead of midterm election through Kavanaugh fiasco, warns analysts
As many top Republicans defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned there will be a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming election.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the election.
The clock can’t be turned back,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s latest attempt at an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate building when the Republicans who control the committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go into the roof,” Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already been high, it’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among still undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, even though they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony of allegations of sexual assault against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confusing mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote or Kavanaugh coming through, it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a group that helps democratic election campaigns, told the news channel.
But Americans in general seem to be divided over who to believe in in the wake of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most.
A new opinion poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations that Ford has made, as well as those from at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposed his genitals to her while they attended a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend’s project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data big” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, making lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data."
The idea with Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of software developers working on the project and a group of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are put on the high end overnight.
"We're not asking them for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era on the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest awarded with Victoria Cross during the First World War celebrated
The only priest in the Church of England who was awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his actions during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never told that he had been awarded the most prestigious award by the British military.
A memorial stone was discovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbolic", that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the firing line and led the line forward with "great courage" before deciding the battle alone.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm very humble toward."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "a real hero's courage is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and instead got to see Greta Gris
Imagine this, you have stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 just to be refused to watch the main event.
The show from San Jose featured 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 06:00, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were not impressed after they had kept waking up to the early hours of the morning to watch the match.
A fan on Twitter described the change to a cartoon children's program as "a sick joke".
“It was the government’s decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they were forced to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications when asked about the broadcast.
"Greta gris, yes"
Bellators CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we will be able to find a solution in terms of the reprise," Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won’t be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program change upset a lot of people.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
In fact, it was a state issue.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will show five matches instead of sex - as we normally do. We took water over our heads in our quest to satisfy the fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Underlying’ Because of Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior to his peers during his upbringing because of his sexuality – but it also spurred him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize he wasn’t like everyone else until he went to high school.”
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne he said he spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show’s regular show host, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
During his one-off appearance on Laverne's first show, Daley tells how he felt "less welcome" than others during his upbringing, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: “This feeling of feeling less worthy and feeling different has been a real source of strength and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so he didn't cheat everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate for HBT rights and leveraged his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt he had the opportunity to live an open life without restrictions and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said his love for a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “came as a surprise.”
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” – he participated in his first OS at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole outlook on life" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year it was just about winning gold,” he said.
“But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was whether they got their tickets to the London 2012 Olympics – where he wanted to sit on the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him: you won’t be able to sit on the front row, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – to dive in front of a home crowd at an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – a song that had followed him until the Olympics and still gave him shakes.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson on the bench during Saturday’s Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he has to fix the shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner spent his day acting high-scoring and training at his game hoping to get a chance to show off his ability.
He has never been the hottest of drivers, not even at the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in shape in front of the tough track at Le Golf National, where the long run often penalties miss hard.
It’s not just the pitch that deters, in the ninth game on Sunday Mickelson meets master Francesco Molinari, who together with the novice Tommy Fleetwood won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below the 12 singles matches, have won at the start, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“His confidence is not wrong.
He is a celebrity and he has added so much to these teams during previous seasons and during the past week.
I probably didn’t think he would be able to play two games.
I thought he would do more, but now that's what it is and we're going to be happy with it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully lived up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, quick, likes to joke with people and he’s a good guy to have in the team,” he explained.
"I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership may soon be a mere memory
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team under the leadership of Seve Ballestero held a five-point advantage over the Americans but ultimately won with the lowest possible margin with the result 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2- 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“It reminds you that we led a lot at Valderrama, we led a lot at Brookline where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won in a nutshell,” Bjorn said (pictured) after seeing 2018’s class win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday and leading with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will prove to me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we will give everything.
Go out and do everything right.
This is not over until we see the score on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this cup and that’s where our focus lies.
I’ve said it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we’re well aware of what’s waiting on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn was pleased with his players' performance on a tough golf course and added: "I would never manage this myself.
There are new challenges tomorrow.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that apply and that is a completely different matter.
It’s fun to be out with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there on your own, your golfing skills are fully tested.
It is the message that you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to go out and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major setbacks during the final days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before ending as a loser when Europe ran "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would want to go out as fast as at Brookline, as at Medinah.
When the pace starts on one side, there is a lot of pressure on these midfields.
We did our set-up and placed the guys we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the match and meet Rory McIlroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the scheme.
“I went with this group of guys in this scheme because I think it’s enough all the way,” Bjorn said of his singles choices.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The German navy’s newest frigate would have been launched in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to faulty systems and high costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were devastating for the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the fleet ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen frigates.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a range of air defense and naval missiles, as well as some stealth techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to park the newest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the ground-breaking warships — which allow Germany to project power abroad — are already obsolete when they are put into service, Die Zeit writes.
The fateful F125 frigate created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but German media reported a number of important "software and hardware flaws" that made the warship worthless if used on a combat mission.
Lack of software was particularly important as ships in the Baden-Wuertemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew on older frigates in the Bremen class.
It also found that the ship has a significant excess weight, which leads to poor performance and limits the Navy’s ability to perform future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the entire project price tag - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have amounted to a staggering 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) - compared to 2.2 billion euros at the start-up stage.
Problems affecting the newest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of the latest warnings that Germany’s naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually “began to lack fully equipped ships.”
The official said that this is a growing problem, as old ships are discontinued but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of the bat.
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their pursuit of food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow southern and dwarf piping as well as brown long-tailed and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat noise and which species do what.
A health map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area view of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’ natural health advisor, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
Fladder mouse populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the well-being and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as airplanes and certain chemical treatments of building materials as well as attacks from house taxes.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, review bon and sometimes carry out rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Threadave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bats.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Threadave we have a good area for bats," he said.
“We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and a lot of favorable habitats.
But there is a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of searching for bats before performing maintenance in real estate, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single dwelling could kill up to 400 females and young, and possibly wipe out an entire population.
Flatter mice are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their bones.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don’t know how their populations feel.”
Ronaldo rejects rape conviction while his lawyers threaten to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him “fake news” and says that people “will market themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers will judge the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal’s and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a Live video on Instagram, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as “fake news” when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after the claims were reported.
"Don't be the first.
What they said today was fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and all is well,” the player said, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to vote on Der Spiegel’s allegations, which they have called “an unauthorized reporting of suspicions of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral injury to an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" the betrayal of the "last percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to a settlement because she felt "feared of retribution" and was concerned about "being humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel the settlement because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in a deal of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain ‘will forever regret’ the loss of car manufacturers
Britain “would regret it forever” if it lost its status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily cease production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no contract termination could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
Other British automakers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems with what car manufacturers say are risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts coming every 37th minute from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could lead to border disruptions that the industry says could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's consumption in stock at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and therefore production would be forced to stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequer’s plan for future relations with the EU is “exactly calibrated to avoid border controls.”
"We need a settlement. We want the best deal that allows, as I say, not only success at the moment to be appreciated now, but for us to take this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's program Today.
“The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but in the longer term warned that increasing costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is head of the Unite union at the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: "My experience is that these jobs will never come back.
A government official said: "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s meeting with Assistant Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “shot in another week” as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump and Russia and the president’s potential obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the assistant justice minister, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fuelled Washington’s downfall for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing interrogation equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president via the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reports that he would resign were made.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Legal Committee's interrogations where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “A date for it has not been set, it can happen this week, or a delay with a week in mind of all the other things that happen at the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press updated.”
Some reporters would dispute that claim: Sanders has not had a White House press conference since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to anything distasteful to TV reporters who “played for the gallery,” even though she said: “I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery.”
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president holds more question sessions than any president before him,” she said, adding without citing evidence: “We’ve looked at these numbers.”
Conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but “if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and then you can ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president perhaps showed why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances in front of the assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland taking into account concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving have continued, ahead of decisions expected to come this autumn.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I value the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of healthcare and benefits the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering from head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent an acute operation after suffering a major injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie acid on the sideline before he was placed on a stretcher carried out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center hospital.
Harris added that "there is no data on the type/ extent of the damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him a season total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help the homeless, according to the Tory Party’s new plans
The measure will neutralise Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
The increase of the stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The UK’s Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success by attracting young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The increase in the stamp duty will be taken out by individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will give a boost to the government’s efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in holiday homes and homes purchased for rent. It can be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 per cent of London’s newly built properties are purchased by people living outside the UK, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to gain a foothold in the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new release comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to refrain from quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain’s “deplorable housing situation.”
Jeremy Corbyn has launched an exciting array of housing reform proposals, including rent ceilings and an end to settlements without the tenant’s indemnity.
He also wants to give municipalities greater opportunity to build new housing.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my time as prime minister to rebuilding the British dream that life will be better for every new generation.
This will solve the problems in the housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also for companies based abroad, to buy homes that are too hard-working residents of our country.
“The dream of owning your home has become just a distant dream for too many people, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to someday become Scotland’s coach.
The 42-year-old is looking forward to the challenge of blowing life in the club from north-east England, currently third in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a match in the B-team and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
"But when I grew up, I looked a lot at Scotland at Hampden with my dad, and it has always attracted me back.
But that opportunity can only come if I manage to lead a club.”
Ross' representatives as coach for Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about succeeding so established names in such a large club. He has previously declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Right now I’m assessing success based on the answer to the question ‘can I get this club back to the Premier League?’
This club belongs absolutely at home in the Premier League, given its structure and talents," he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably just see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there.”
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as an assistant coach in Dumbarton and a 15-month tenure as a member of Heart’s coaching team.
Then he helped Alloa get back from relegation to the third division, and lifted St Mirren from being close to relegation to becoming the winner of the championship title the following season.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a cause," he recalls, referring to when he took command of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was totally right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had good results and could live on it. Besides, I had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
There is a lot you have to go through every week.
There is still stress and pressure at work for me, but exercising feels absolutely right.
I’ve always wanted to practice and now I do. I feel better than I’ve ever done in my entire adult life.”

A study shows that the perfect time to have a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
This summer’s heatwave has meant increased revenue for the country’s struggling pubs, but the restaurant chains have gotten more pressure on themselves.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of CGA, the company’s consulting firm, said: “Continued beautiful weather and the fact that England stayed in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we were allowed to see a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%.
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that primarily offer drinks showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubs offering food also had difficulty in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People just seem to want to go out and drink something.
The impact on managed pubs and bars went up by 6.6% that month, and food sales down by 3%."
Paul Newman, at RSM’s service and entertainment analyst, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors when it comes to sales in the large kitchen market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups still face difficulties, although a 4.8% decrease in sales each year is particularly difficult to manage in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer couldn’t have come more inappropriate for companies driven by food sales. Time to show if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August give some much-needed respiration.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub and restaurant industry in the UK collects and analyzes data on the way in which 47 active groups with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion are involved, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One study shows that one in five children, sometimes as young as 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school and high school students shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has raised concerns that it is sexual content that is posted there
20% of students said they had a "main account" that they showed to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, create accounts on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school and high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Instagram accounts", a reference to the image sharing service Instagram.
The result has raised concerns that it is sexual content that is posted there.
20% of students stated that they have a cleaned "main account" that they can show to their parents, and so they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
According to the study, conducted by the organizations Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had private accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to creating places on the internet where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Association, Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as an external board member at the governing body’s annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most acclaimed athlete, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her broad international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has won great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are confident that the athletes in Scotland would greatly benefit from her becoming a member of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle says, “I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, has a total of four Olympic golds and is now an expert commentator on the BBC. He lost the ability to go after a mini-stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today, a month ago, I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time had to tell if I was going to recover, and to what extent.

Advertising for breast pumps that compare moms with where the internet shares
A company that sells breast pumps has caused differences of opinion on the internet with an ad that compares nursing moms to cows that get milked.
To highlight the launch of what is said to be the "world's first silent portable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired commercial with a humorous feel to show what freedom the new pump gives moms pumping breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a pile of cows to a song with lines like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you didn't know, this isn't a Jew, it's a bitch."
The refrain continues: "Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the commercial, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy on the internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has faced mixed reactions from viewers. Many say that it sheds light on the "phases" of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just like we need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them only a few days after birth.
Elvie breast pump can be worn discreetly in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It is understood that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But sure, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?”
Another one adds: "What a reality-driven commercial."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically funny."
“I think this is brilliant.
I would have gotten one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
“This is a great product,” someone wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny commercial that turns to moms pumping (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feels like ‘cots.’”
This is not a film that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump stuck in the glove.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or pipes and can be worn discreetly in a nursing gown, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is a shareholder and ECD at Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and milk milk, we wanted to shed light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while showing in an entertaining and easily recognizable way what an incredible sense of freedom the new pump gives.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a two-year-old mother appeared on the catwalk wearing clothes by designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp near the Texas border
The number of freedom-obsessed migrant children has skyrocketed even though the number of people crossing the border each month is relatively unchanged. This is partly due to the fact that the harsh rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration have made it harder to place the children in reference persons.
In the past, most reference persons themselves have been paperless immigrants, and are afraid to put their own opportunities to stay in the country at stake by declaring themselves willing to accept a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult members of the household would be required to provide fingerprints, and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Administration, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be reference persons for unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known by law enforcement authorities since before.
“Almost 80% of the people who are either reference persons themselves or family members of reference persons are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
So we continue to pursue these individuals,” Albence said.
In order to deal with children’s issues more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to be in court within one month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was previously practice, according to staff at the establishments.
Many of them are present at video link rather than personally to bring their lawsuit for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered entitled to protection are quickly deported.
The longer children are deprived of their liberty, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or refugee attempts, according to staff at the facilities and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say concerns are rising at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that a child has it are more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They add that if children move to the tent town without having enough time to prepare emotionally and say goodbye to friends, the trauma many are already struggling with.
Syria demands that U.S., French and Turkish "occupational forces" withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said the Damascus government would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “all illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, and accused "certain Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" that enables refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return,” he said.
“They are politicizing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russo-Turkish agreement suspended a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines", and expressed hope that a military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of the government and members of the opposition, to make a draft post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set up conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said that the group's work would be limited to "oversight of the articles of the current constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the 2020 re-election unless his presidency ends prematurely through impeachment and scandal, which many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there is no sign that the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, the viewership of the best broadcast time has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and is almost three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best broadcast time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has peaked the charts for cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during major news nights.
“This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell is a longtime comedy writer and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club".
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Donald Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” says Nell Scovell.
In the chaos there is an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the report from Washington can determine the future of the abortion case, Roe vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the prosperity of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you have suddenly sat and watched for six hours on an expert panel that discusses Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostrich leather for $15,000, as the "Washington coat was filled with Daniel", "a coat of mail"
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is that he comes up with something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump’s rotating cast and daily intrigue.
If you miss a single episode, you end up on the trail.
When I spoke to TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week it was sunny and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai, Hawaii, but he sat and stared inside and watched MSNBC while recording a broadcast from CNN.
He could not wear himself out, not when Brett Kavanaugh would be brought before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court lay in the balance sheet.
“I remember when we did all those crazy shows before, and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the smoothest race ever before the midterm elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district receives a lot of money, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district that has allowed two members to now compete for the same seat.
This recently re-arranged suburban district of Pittsburg is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb is campaigning against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were constitutionally altered in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a campaign funding dispute between major party economic sections, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a small win in a widely guarded special election in March to Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That place had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain lead.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for Chinese aid, but then backed down
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the partners overthrew the Trump organization’s leadership team.
U.S. Department of State officials decided to call the heads of U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama home because of "newly made decisions not to recognize Taiwan," Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including money for drug control and development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country hard with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice put an end to consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will now take place in mid-October, which is a sign of how important the presidential administration considers the meeting to be, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussions against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Study the history
The next inevitable step could be the special investigator Robert Mueller’s report on Donald Trump’s alleged abuse of justice, which is now available in public records.
Mueller is also reportedly directing his investigation into whether Donald Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in its attacks on the US election.
If Congress were to change the majority, Trump will be held accountable to that assembly just as he prepares to stand again in the election, and perhaps finally before a civil jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to face different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how drawn the fight can become.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the Western countries had resisted him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such decisive events, and the incessant progress of democracy is either accelerated or slowed down.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What should we do if Donald Trump fires Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what will happen to Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that he proposed last year to secretly record the president, and speculated that he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says The Times reporting is not correct.
"How should we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he is allowed to appear in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a congress that holds Donald Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I don’t think we will fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light Sabbath lights on the table decorated with the hook cross.
With what as a legacy, how could I be anything but an optimist about the future?”

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with Rapid Wien
The Rangers will take on Rapid Wien on Thursday, knowing that winning against the Austrians after the impressive Spain match against Villarreal that ended the draw earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, until the 2-2 game against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard for greater success.
“That was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game in the belief that we could get something, and went from there with a point.
We might have gotten it in at the end, but in general it was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half. We came back in the second half and were the better team.
Now on Thursday, it will be an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough match. They got a good result in their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can certainly move forward and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put last season behind us and succeed well.”
Women don’t sleep well due to fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear picture of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the step and talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse/taste and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your counselor and family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices can have a big impact on costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your options for long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover costs, or self-insurance with your own funds, if you can afford it.
Establish legal documents: Avoid legal disputes from the beginning.
Establish a care executive, so you can appoint a trusted person who oversees your medical care and ensures that the care staff follows your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure your bills are paid if you are incapacitated yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who is in an acute medical condition and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the economy at stake, but who are the doctors?” Martin asked.
“What medications are they?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure you have the plan ready.”
He was shot several times in Ilfracombe.
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home from a night out.
The victim, who is in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police describe the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m., as a "sudden incident".
The victim did not see his attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to hear from them.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, officials say. The death toll is expected to rise.
The communications have been delayed, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain any information from the Donggala administrative area, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, and is located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city's population was estimated at 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is an administrative area that extends more than 300 km off the northwest coast of Sulawesi.
The administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
The mainstays of the Central Sulawesi economy are fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also significant in the province, but it is mainly concentrated to Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past hundred years, according to Indonesia’s disaster management authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Also in 1996 the western Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the circum-Pacific seismic aging, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries. 226,000 people died along the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck across the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of V<0xC3><0xA4>stra Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Dozens of villages were destroyed and around 300 people were killed.
2016: A ground quake hit the Pidie Jaya administrative area of Aceh and caused destruction and panic, when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that razed together.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok. More than 500 people died, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of abuse.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for engaging in a report of domestic violence and for opposing the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he allegedly picked up the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is detained in the Mat-Su jail and held against the $500 bail to be paid if the suspect violates the bail conditions, according to the KTUU television channel.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteed not guilty" when asked to state his position, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three less serious crimes under Class A, which means he can be jailed for up to a year and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a minor class B felony, which is punishable by one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now handled by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, for reporting domestic violence and for possession of weapons under the influence of the incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of beating her in the face.
Sarah Palin received criticism from veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which stems from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are down, and death rates are expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Movies that show when it hit are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit across the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental car from the Home Depot construction and interior design chain to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. He downed pedestrians and cyclists on his way to the attack, which took place in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to the intent statement on the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both points of indictment may involve a death sentence, according to the court order.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged by a 22-point federal jury, including eight cases of murder to support protective activities, often used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as the abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "comprehensive planning and intent," the prosecutors said, while describing the way Saipov performed it as "disgusting, cruel and inhuman."
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pangnucco damage and loss," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has not filed a lawsuit seeking a death penalty for a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug addicts, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal court in New York City in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of embezzlement for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were both executed in an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, said the court documents showed a lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching ISIS movies on his phone.
He also asked to put up the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges in the indictment.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, who said they are "of course disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to appeal for the death penalty instead of agreeing to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole if the defendant confesses guilty only prolongs the trauma that these events have caused for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Tories MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army” today during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must “feel the heat” from the EU skeptics, when one of Theresa May’s own MEPs suggested he would lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the march in Birmingham that Britain would have already “gone out” if Nigel Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge that Theresa May faces in getting the deeply divided supporters to reconcile has been exacerbated by EU-positive Tory members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers Agreement, alive under attack from Brexit supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should press on and try to get a deal with Brussels despite the backlash, forcing EU skeptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "chaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by the organization Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "spoil the Chequers deal".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been at the helm, we would have been at this team," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents Wellingborough district in Parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must flush the Chequers deal."
He made clear his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought a world war to become subjects.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed the claims that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The thought that the British would have changed and now want to stay is completely untrue."
Brexit candidate Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory party was also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'The Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers deal is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in the party and with our election workers who are out on the streets and make sure we are elected.
Put away the Chequers deal and start listening."
And she added a sharp message to Theresa May: “Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must “feel the heat” if they would betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to cheat Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, 'We're not going to let you get away with it.'"
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to have our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people’s army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.”
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists waved banners with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis of the House of Lords mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
“It’s these people who say they can have IT systems in place and all technology for Canada plus plus plus the agreement, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a pure father.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans a "regular thinker" to run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take on a “regular thinker about running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and is now running for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was the vice president of Donald Trump’s campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the subject of speculation that she may be dealing with Donald Trump 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th city council meeting with voters since Donald Trump joined.
One person asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it's time "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government. That means a woman on top."
A person arrested for the death shooting of basketball player Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the death shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 a.m. for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man seen in the photos.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died of this," Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the news site 247 sports.
Wayde went in between to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been on the scene and had a gun, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Cup title after team murders gave him a win over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it was clear that Mercedes' team murders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hung out Hamilton on dry when he defended his position during the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the deck first and let Hamilton drive into the back of the club, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went in a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after some wheel-to-wheel action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with the risk of offering in place after a double-drag to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the rear row and lay seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and kept in the tyres to reach a quick finish and drive around Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
In the end he came in the depot on the 44th yard but failed to raise the pace during the remaining eight yards when Raikkonen went up to fourth place.
It’s a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an exceptional job and got one and one second," Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, because she maintains that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is a Supreme Court justice, is charged with sexual assault.
The president, speaking at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly take up the testimony of Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee; instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "bad, nasty, and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the nice thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, ugly, nasty and lying," he said.
“You see the press releases and leaks and they say, ‘No, I didn’t.
I haven't done it."
Do you remember?
Did you smell it, Dianne Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Did you leak the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't tasted it."
Wait a minute.
"We've leaked... No, we haven't leaked anything," he added, imitating the senator.
The letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
“I haven’t denied Ford’s allegations, I haven’t leaked her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it as confidential as she wanted.”
But her dementia does not seem to have suited the president, who during Saturday night's meeting commented it like this: "I'm going to tell you one thing. That was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continues to support the candidate for the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and he hinted that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power with all the necessary means.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control,” the president said, according to the digital news site Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars scored Friday's Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Belfast Giants received an early two-way lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie returned to the home team before Dwyer re-established Belfast Giants management.
Francois Bouchard conceded to Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two teams, and the Belfast Giants had won the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford assisted when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intensive first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who got it at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Belfast Giants were in the lead at the first break when he made his second goal for the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard conceded once again with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team's fifth half-way through the final period.
The Belfast Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died as hundreds of people on a plane could flee from earthquakes
A flight attendant in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he died when he saw that a plan with hundreds of people on board could safely lift.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are caught in the rush in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly dormant control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could safely lift.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would rage.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved the lives of hundreds of people, according to Australian television channel ABC News.
“We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
“We are devastated to hear this,” he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death toll could rise to over a thousand people. The country’s disaster relief authority says there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The death toll is believed to continue to rise because there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been able to be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Up to six meters high waves have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
It is bad for clean water.
“Minimum markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will face from there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now reports a man missing after an airplane crashed into a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean now reports that a man is missing. Previously, it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the sinking plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at the Chuuk<0xC3><0xB6>arna airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the course of the incident looked like.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses thought the planet was past the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew in very low.
“It’s very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to wade through mid-level water to the emergency exits on the sinking planet.
He said the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who worked closely to develop a ship's tail also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to drive people ashore before the plane sank into the 30 meter deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor’s side ended its lawsuit in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone lists to bribe 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicts his previous claims, the Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers’ cell phone during the time period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, some time after Chambers' death, deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He sucked her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final run on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip-Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that hip hop has come a long way from its origin in political messages and to attack social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a boost in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?
New York girl sues couple for dismissal after 'racist' text message
A teenage girl in New York faces a pair of discriminatory dismissals after she received a mistranslated text message from her mother, who complained that she was “a black again.”
The couple denies that they would be racist and compare the mood with "expression".
Two-year-old mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed concern when she realized that the new baby girl Giselle Maurice was black, when she came to her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEY IS NOT A BIG ONE AGAIN,” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "ill to mods", and fired Maurice, claiming that their former child girl, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she instead expected a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice got paid for a day's work and was sent home in a taxi.
Now she is right for the couple to get compensation for the dismissal. She requests compensation in the order of $350 per day for the work she was initially hired to do, which would be for six months and where she would stay with the couple. However, she did not have a contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she told the New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple dismisses the allegations that they would be racists and says the only straight thing was to end Giselle Maurice's employment. They were worried that they would not be able to trust her when they had insulted her.
“My wife had sent her something she didn’t mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Plasco told the New York Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone you’d been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously, seriously."
Plasco compared the mood to "expression" and said his wife would give birth two months later and found herself in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to give up on such a person?
It’s not very pleasant,” added investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticizes them for their behavior and reasoning.
The Paddington publishers didn’t think readers could relate to a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Paddington author Michael Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented: “It’s hard to imagine what it was like for a person to read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s really fun, given what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She told that her father, who had worked as a cameraman on the BBC before being inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She allowed the 60th anniversary of the first edition to be "bitterly stolen" after his death.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family", and added that her father was proud in the silence of his final success.
“He was quite quiet, and not a proud person,” she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds in something. You become proud of the child even if it is not you who has achieved it.
I think he saw Paddington's successes a little bit that way.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington his own honor."
My daughter would die, and I got to say goodbye on the phone
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, and that she wasn’t expected to make it,” Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad who said that she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my dear.
I'll get to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly swam out and left her body.
She had died just before, and now everything was shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I couldn’t scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now suffered the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane along with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult ordeal she was going through.
“No one knew about it,” she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Nursing women put up postcards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost relatives due to suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have mapped a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers to call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to have to be as bad as I do every day,” she says.
Sharon Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and tells us that her son was a promising chef who had an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up the room.”
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother when he died in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, “I’m always worried about the consequences.”
Sharon Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t sit there and talk about it.”
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost his partner for 15 years, Mark, a time after his mother’s death.
"He hadn't said he felt downcast or depressed or anything," she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he was behaving differently.
On Christmas Day, he was on the bottom, and when the kids opened their Christmas presents, he didn't have eye contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very hard blow for them, but they have to get through it. "It rips up a wound in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to fight all of us.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as FBI investigates
"I thought that if we could accomplish something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - then maybe we could get some agreement," Jeff Flake said on Saturday. He admitted that he feared that the committee would be "split" due to deeply rooted party differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their reluctance depends entirely on the time.
The midterm elections will take place in just five weeks, on November 6th. If Republicans make a bad election, which is expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personal secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his invasion of the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors "slows" under Kim
The number of North Koreans jumping off to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, which cites data from South Korea’s reunification ministry, says 1,127 people jumped from last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park says tougher border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher fees for human smugglers are key causes.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fly via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back by force.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still at war with each other, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks focusing on the stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean peninsula to be free from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the U.S. of failing to succeed since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we can absolutely not disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had bet like that, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the allegations of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh became very emotionally affected, and from time to time he almost cried and his voice staggered as he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, saying the charges against him were a "grotesque and coordinated character murder" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she considered Kavanaugh’s testimony to prove that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was biased to the Democrats’ disadvantage.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi doubted when she was asked whether she would try to bring Kavanaugh to trial if he gets elected, and whether the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I can say this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he’s at now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that she as a Democrat was concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion goal Roe vs. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would change some Supreme Court decisions.
It’s not a place for a hysterical and biased person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud,” Pelosi said.
Women have to stand out.
It’s a fair criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
And she continued: “I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said that she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying she said to the person she was talking to: ‘You might think I’m sorry because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed to get out of anger partly because they are often misunderstood in the basics.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs in a man-dominated office, where I once cried of indescribable anger, was that I was taken in the collar of an older woman. It was a cold boss that I had always been a little afraid of, and she dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sorry and are happy that they managed to pressure you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught up with an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and pulled out of the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of running for president.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since she was late, she was left with the money collection, promising not to go in as a candidate if she didn’t get $2 million together.
It was a project that was doomed to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she announced in a speech that she would not launch a formal presidential campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude for those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism, that the vote stalled.
“You could have thought I had had a nervous breakdown,” Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der recalls about the press’ reactions.
“You could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, 'What are they going to write on my gravestone?'
"She's crying?"
Why the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening curtain in the US-China trade war was deafening. The war is far from over, but the gap between the countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long run, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by coating important Chinese export goods such as solar panels, steel and aluminum with tariffs.
The most significant escalation came this week, with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, which means in practice that half of all goods entering the United States from China are subject to tariffs.
Beijing has responded with the same coin each time, and recently, between five and ten percent of U.S. goods were dumped for $60 billion.
China has promised to match the actions of the United States, and the world's second largest economy will probably not step down in a foreseeable time.
Getting Washington to back up means bowing to demands, but publicly crawling for the United States would be all too genant for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US trade war press can provide positive support to China in the long run, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic panic in either country, and it’s actually significantly more dangerous than viewers have previously wanted to admit,” said Abigail Grace, research assistant with a focus on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria "ready" for returning refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says the country is ready to welcome voluntarily returning refugees and calls for help to build the country, which is in ruins after the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are now improving.
“The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in fighting terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that it does not receive conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the rebellion.
Europe set to win the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with the final 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the knockout on the 16th hole pair 3 course, and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever made 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5 & 4 by the European team's lowest-ranked player, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against England's Ian Poulter, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who is a veteran with eight Ryder Cups behind him, became the tournament’s most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the win.
It’s about the team, and I’m glad I could be of help,” Garcia said after the Europa League win.
He handed over the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single on Sunday.
"What an incredible pride, to beat Tiger Woods. I'm grown up looking at him," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in the Ryder Cup.
A remarkable statistic for one of the world’s best players ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys they've been fighting.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the shit.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a fantastic captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
We will regroup, I will work with the US PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee and we will move on.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be the captain.
You get to bend and bend.
They played better than us.”
Algae bloom: Halter decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in concentrations of algae blooms for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, more uneven blooms are reported in the areas around the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate a decrease in holdings.
The algal bloom extends over 20 miles off the coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Spots can be seen about one and a half miles out into the sea outside the municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Algae blooming has also been observed in the municipality of Pasco.
Average concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported over the past week. Outside the coast of Hillsborough, low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations in couscous with
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwestern Florida last week.
