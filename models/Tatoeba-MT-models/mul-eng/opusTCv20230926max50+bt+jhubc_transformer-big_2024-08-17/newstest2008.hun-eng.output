European food inflation has slowed down over the past few years.
The fast-moving inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid growth in food prices.
The November price increase in the euro area was higher than expected in 13 countries, with an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent after 2.6 per cent in October, the European Union’s statistical office reported.
The official forecast was only 3 percent likely, according to Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has, unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, not cut its base, saying the reduction would lead to the development of inflationary spirals along with rising raw materials and easing unemployment.
The ECB is under two per cent, but wants to keep its inflation rate close to that.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in its twenty-second trap: "we need to talk about" inflation so that we don't have to act on this issue later.
In Germany, the value of November’s inflation rate is a record 12 years; in Spain it rose from 4.1 to 3.6.
Eurozone inflation has been swindled by rising food and energy prices.
The price of soybeans has risen by 88 percent over the period, and the price of soybeans has reached its highest value since 1973.
It also had to pay significantly more for oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world oil market price has risen by 52 percent this year, and last month it has cost nearly $100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent this year in 2008, but it will fall to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate will remain around 3 percent over the next 3-4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, it is expected that the ECB will double its interest rate during 2008.
The Gallup government is in crisis.
After a long stagnation of Fidesz supporters, it has grown significantly since early December, making it the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has not yet measured such low, 13 percent socialist support.
In the case of secure party voters, the difference would be more than two-thirds (71 per cent) in favour of the MSZP’s one-fifth (20 per cent) support.
According to the survey, the MDF and the SZDSZ are under the parliamentary threshold: their support for the entire population is two percent.
Among the surest party voters, the supporters of both camps are more than one percent.
The economic environment has been further deteriorated to the previous low – never before has it been so high, 41 percent of those who have been judged to be very bad in the country’s economic situation, while another 46 percent say the situation is quite bad.
The change in the financial situation of the families is now being judged more pessimistically after the more hopeful looks of spring and summer.
For the next year, the majority of the population is expected to see further deterioration and only a tenth improvement.
In December, more than any previous Gallup survey, 71 percent of respondents said that the prime minister is doing his job poorly than the prime minister is doing well.
In Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny, 13 per cent of the respondents are confident or very confident, while in Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n, 38 per cent are supporters.
In the prime minister, 54 percent are not trusted at all, and 27 percent in the Fidesz president.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is how much part of society thinks that it is possible to deal with dissatisfaction with the prime minister without a change of government.
While 35 per cent of the government and the head of government remained desirable after last October's riots, only 20 per cent of the vote is now in favour, while the relative majority (33 per cent) sees only the solution in the writing of new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 per cent of the respondents answer to the question that underpins the intention to participate, that he would certainly leave, and another 20 per cent say that he would probably leave.
By comparison, only 55 per cent of the "national assembly elections to be held on Sunday" would certainly take part and another 15 per cent would be likely to take part. The result of the referendum would not be questionable on the basis of current intentions.
In terms of tuition, people would say no to 74, visiting 79, and hospital daily 84 percent would say no.
If we only look at the same rates among those promising to secure their participation in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would take away the introduction of tuition, visitation fees and hospital day fees.
The most expensive one is Auchan, the Tesco rose by almost five
In the trade triangle in Budapest, hypermarkets maintained last year’s average 16 percent price growth, with the difference that this year the VAT did not rise.
The Daily Economy Article
This year, on average, the daily Christmas basket increased by 16 per cent in the commercial triangle in Budapest, but in each hypermarket, there was an increase of well over 1000 HUF in value.
Since prices in food stores had already “stood up” in December last year, so the previous high base was not shown as a percentage of the drastic depreciation.
But it’s obviously scary for consumers that what they received in well under 9,000 HUF last year isn’t even worth tens of thousands of dollars.
At least 91 forints have crossed the ten thousand forints threshold in the hypermarkets examined.
The highest basket value was HUF 10,573.
(In 2003 the basket was sold for 6,800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year’s level, but it was very expensive for turkey meat, dio and mackerel.
KSH’s data followed the prices of flour and bread in stores, although we found one kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 HUF.
The competition did not print the price of the product below 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the two-litre reusable bottle of Coca-Cola was below HUF 200, so with a deposit only HUF 257 was requested for the product.
This year, however, the Auchan was the most expensive in the Daily Basket, while the Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora 15 increased prices by about 18-18 per cent compared to last year’s Christmas prices, while Tesco and Auchan increased prices in the Daily Basket by about 18-18 per cent.
Compared to last year’s most expensive and cheapest basket price, the difference was 12 percent, while last year’s cheapest and most expensive one was 21 percent growth.
The average growth in forint was 1480.
Last year, the average price increase came to 1206 forints, so that last Christmas felt the effect of the price increase on VAT.
It was this process that dissipated trade, and it was evident that the shops were not able to decide how much price they applied to a product, because they were unable to calculate what effect the price change would have on consumption.
(If the rotational speed of a product is poorly designed by the trader, then serious profit may fall on the adjusted price for the traffic intensity.)
Last year’s price increase was so extreme that the price difference was only 844 forints, the most expensive of which was 1720 forints, and the most expensive of which was 844 forints.
This year this extreme did not show, as the most expensive today was 1630 forints more than last year, and the cheapest was 1284 forints.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, catastrophic shadow growth has been shown, with daily consumer items in hypermarkets being more than 30 percent expensive in less than 20 months.
(By the way, this does not necessarily corroborate the KSH data: the statistical office measured a shadow increase of more than 30 percent over 12 months for some basic foods.
So, for example, in addition to the flour in the egg.)
According to the Daily Basket, this seems almost impossible in the latter, since the price level of the product was already quite expensive last year compared to the base, in the worst case, it produced a shadow growth of just over 10 percent.
According to the signs, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg yolks, and the drastic price increase on the multiplicity has also managed to overtake them.
In the trade gold triangle, the hippies do not complain, they constantly report a good year.
According to our experience, the total number of customers in the three stores visited is no longer interested in prices.
They buy quantity from everything, they take sustainable food to the plateau.
On Wednesday morning, serious queues broke out in front of all three stores, as the number of visitors suddenly increased.
But we know that in the countryside the traffic is more profitable, more multi complains to the research companies that even their plans will be left behind, and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of sustainable consumption articles.
In many places, it is stored on disinfectants.
This year, more than 1,000 infections have been recorded in hospitals, which were mainly due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of the hospitals, the weight of the beds, the overload of the staff do not favor the cessation of infections, says the Head of the Department of Epidemiology at the National Center for Epidemiology.
They are also stored in many places on disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatological department of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital.
In a man who got into a serious accident, a bacterium resistant to antibiotics was shown.
The patient was separated.
A similar infection occurred at the beginning of the year.
A serious car accident was allowed to return home from the hospital, but it was not long after that he had to return with MRSA infection, and he had not been able to perform an important surgery since then due to the bacteria in his body.
This year, a hospital infection caused by a multidrug-resistant disease was reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz Karolina, Head of the Department of Epidemiology at the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that the infection caused by so many multi-resistant pathogens has certainly been registered in hospitals, the others are not known.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, a methicillin-oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried by one third of people without it in the nose to cause the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) respond well to antibiotics, are well treatable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or improperly, a highly antibiotic-responsive bacterium develops a highly resistant bacterium against antibiotics, which spreads quickly under inappropriate hospital conditions.
In particular, when the immune system is temporarily or permanently malfunctioning, it can cause serious hospital infections in patients with the most weakened organs, old or low body weight, such as infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the medical director of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the virus, MRSA is just not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not examined.
Resistant to Antibiotics
“We separate such patients, the nursing staff sees the patient in a rubber band and a mask, and they have the right antibiotics to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients who are admitted to the hospital will be examined first to see if MRSA is present in their body, but it is not always possible to get rid of the infection.
It is not a fashion for sampling
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA would be preventable, but current domestic hospital conditions and conditions are not conducive to the prevention of the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
After this infection typically occurs in hospitals, age groups, hospitals should check the patients who are admitted and patients who are carrying MRSA should be separated immediately.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, microbiological sampling is not in fashion.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these studies.
Most cases are thus brought to light when the patient is diagnosed with MRSA, said the head of the department of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections and pathologies.
It is necessary to strive for antibiotic therapy to be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out so as not to develop resistance to drugs, but hospitals do not maintain this in every case.
Microbiological samples are even rarer in the case of foot-and-mouth disease, said Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
They save on anti-infectives
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often spread from one patient to the other through the intervention of health care staff.
Therefore, handwashing, gloves, and the use of masks play a very important role, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA is spread by drip infection, contact, however, in the domestic hospital conditions, there is not always a possibility to isolate the infected patient.
In fact, hospital rooms are often crowded, often very close to each other with beds, but from an emergency point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
Unfortunately, it is also noticeable, B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz Karolina noted, that in hospitals in an unfavorable financial situation, infectious disinfectants are stored, few in the caregiver, many in the patient, so there is an even greater chance of developing infections.
According to B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are taken, there is shown to be less infection or the spread of the disease can be stopped.
Government Program Against MRSA
Managing MRSA infection causes huge expenses for health insurers, so they fight it everywhere.
In England, for example, the government programme included prevention and reduction of MRSA.
According to the signs, the program is successful, and according to the data provided, MRSA infections are showing a decreasing trend in England.
Among the priorities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) is the prevention of the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and of hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
The captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion was drawn up in the case of a fatal accident caused by the District Police Captain XXII.
It can be ruled out that he would have been intoxicated or in a drunken state by the district police captain XXII who had resigned from his post in the meantime, who had gassed a pedestrian to death on Tuesday, informed Morvai Attila, spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department, on Friday, after he resigned.
The expert opinion supported the preliminary investigation, which has already established that the former police captain had not consumed alcohol before he was sitting behind the wheel.
The then captain of the XXII district capitol, with his own passenger car, hit the 55-year-old man who did not want to cross to the side of the road in a corner of the XXII district’s Kossuth Lajos street.
(The latter, therefore, is that the pedestrian does not cross the zebra, by the rules of the KRESZ is by the way not a relief, the turning car must also give priority.)
The pedestrian lost his life after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of the incident, the district police chief resigned his post and asked him to be placed in a resting place, according to the police because he was so shocked by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Investigative Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also stated that the former police captain had been cooperating with the prosecutors conducting the investigation from the beginning.
A further <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
Three, totalling <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million, signed a loan framework agreement supporting education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as a loan agreement with the Minister of Finance Veres J<0xC3><0xA1>nos and Marta Gajecka, the European Investment Bank (EIB)
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework in 2006 for the financing of transport and environmental projects from cohesion under the Cohesion Fund, of which the parties are now using a loan agreement of EUR 100 million to finance the Hungarian budget.
Projects related to education are also financed by the budget of the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million loan agreement.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for this purpose for Hungary, the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million can be made later by extending the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a EUR 50 million contract, which is used primarily for the University of Debrecen’s research and development project.
The meeting was also attended by the 4th Metro.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, they will return to whether and how to amend the original contract.
According to Veres J<0xC3><0xA1>nos, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans shall be provided by the EIB without a maintenance fee of EURIBOR for a duration of 8 years.
Bulgaria is the EU’s real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is remarkable - the whole of Europe is focused on the Balkan country mentioned earlier.
What, where and who is buying the EU is still the cheapest, but quickly expensive market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most popular real estate shopping destination in Eastern Europe is now, without a doubt, Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
Among the mountains are the most fashionable areas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and on the beach Albena, the "Aranypart", the "Napospart", the ancient Szozopol and Neszebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balcsik.
According to analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country will also attract the interest of investors - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more are shopping in the so-called cheap Rusz neighbourhood.
The capital, Sofia, also offers attractive opportunities, and the commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its best path to becoming one of the most attractive European golf paradises, so that in addition to the summer and winter season, the other two seasons will be a preferred destination.
For this reason, forward-looking investors are already buying heavily, such as in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, buyers of real estate in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyles at the same time.
Most of the buyers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, and there are traditionally many Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski paradises.
Foreign buyers can be classified into three groups - says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Residents or renovated properties buy old houses for between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50,000 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000, or destroyed old houses for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000, and then renovate them.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, important to them is the proximity of a big city, shops and usually the local doctor.
The second category is for holiday buyers (Bulgaria appeared on the list of the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is made up of business-oriented investors who buy in the hope of medium- or long-term value growth.
The price of real estate in the capital is constantly increasing, as demand is increasing.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years they have increased by 21 per cent annually.
The increase in real estate rates is fundamentally beyond the increase in payments.
Fodor and the Six Percentage of Hungarians
Fodor G<0xC3><0xA1>bor, Minister of Environment and Water, said that the expert meetings will conclude on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, after the official opening, the international climate-resistance talks will continue with the ministers’ talks after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world are discussing the Bali Travel Plan, which has efforts following the period of emissions reduction as set out in the Kyoto Protocol for 2012.
There is currently a lot of debate between developing and developing countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not currently want to discuss exact figures, although it is leaning towards an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to the 1990s.
The other big question at the conference is whether the developed countries are committed to reducing emissions, as well as whether they are providing both financial and technological assistance to the countries struggling to do so.
There was also an agreement on the support to be given to developing countries.
The support fund, which is covered by the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a board of directors of 16 members, which is expected to be read within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - in the Market and Profit.
Six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister for Environment and Water, Fodor G<0xC3><0xA1>bor, supports the EU’s efforts to preserve its role in global climate protection efforts and to promote the creation of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to a 20 per cent reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions compared to the 1990 level and to a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, regardless of the success of the "post-2012 agreement", and is ready to reach an additional 30 per cent.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor pointed out that in 1997, a total of 5.2 per cent of the countries that acceded to the Kyoto Protocol were set on fire, with the EU - then 15 Member States - taking on less than 8 per cent.
The gas emission measurement of 6 per cent of Hungary’s greenhouse gas emissions compared to the period 1985-87, which will be fulfilled by our country. – recalls the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
The stake is high in Balin, since it is not necessary to sign a long-term international climate policy agreement on climate change within two years, otherwise its entry into force would be likely to take effect after 2012. In this case, the Kyoto Protocol does not include a reduction in IP commitments
With this, the emission reduction would suffer a delay and become inevitable an increase above the Earth’s average temperature of 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is on YouTube
Recordings of Iraqi and Afghan actions are made public by the video sharing units of the British Army, with which they are popularizing themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has been given to YouTube: special formations in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC said.
These are controlled by the Air Canada Operations Command, which monitors the footage taken with a miniature, helmet-mounted camera, and then sent to London, where they are uploaded to the Internet by the natives.
The political message is inevitable.
Of the Air Force’s soldiers, 139 have already been recorded in this form on the Internet, and their “channels” have been viewed by more than 75,000.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and publishes videos of both Iraqi and Afghan actions, while the British Ministry of International Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and Iraq's International Peacekeeping Corps (MNFI) also have YouTubec.
Invasion in Afghanistan
According to the original intent of the Air Force, the videos were made for conscription purposes, and according to the Ministry of Defense, it is also good to get to know the general public about the real purpose of the army’s foreign presence.
The propaganda published in such a form is almost useless compared to traditional, television-based counter-attack ads, Gordon Mackenzie, a defence expert, told the BBC, but he is also inexorably carrying some political message, as the military in its special form is being confirmed by the military.
The U.S. played a game
In addition to carefully edited, censored footage, the army also has a problem with amateur videos appearing on the distributor, which, for example, also show the death of soldiers: they are a bit hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, because they do not engage in the propaganda films of the masses maxim.
A number of videos from the Iraqi and Afghan military have already been posted on the internet, which was made at sharp talks, but the British military has only recently received it.
The Americans come up with a slightly different, free-to-download shooter game called America's Army, in which you can hide directly into the skin of the soldiers as part of a more or less lively simulation.
It’s going to be a fun and fun Christmas at the ministries.
The Minister of Labour, M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth, does not seem to be emotional: instead of a Christmas party, he will hold an annual working meeting with his colleagues, who can thank him with a bag of tea and coffee from 2007.
Akad is a ministry where there will be a celebration of live music, with a button and a car ring somewhere else, they conjure up a Christmas mood in the hearts of the officials.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and Swedish table - so fun with the power.
The state offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest ministerial Christmas party is being held by the Defence Council this year, but HM is not waiting for ministerial workers.
The children of the fallen soldiers receive a gift on Christmas Eve, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited to the Missionary Christmas, but they also host a press reception.
The bag will cost 25 million for the year-end mood.
The National Development Agency (NF<0xC3><0x9C>) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) are pulling out of the loop compared to the other portfolios.
The GKM party is held in the House of the Future, out of a total of 4,320,000 HUF, and approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected from the six hundred ministry workers.
They will stick to the Christmas mood at the festival, but there will be performers and drums as well.
The NF<0xC3><0x9C>’s Christmas was valued at 4,700,000 HUF and was held in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) on Wednesday – concerts and dinners.
The turmeric was sold for one million forints, with more than four hundred invitations to the remainder.
We know that one class of the NF<0xC3><0x9C> is also official for another Christmas celebration: it is organized by a tendering company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, from EU funds.
For this purpose, the building of the V<0xC3><0xAD>gs<0xC3><0xAD>nh<0xC3><0xA1>z was rented out.
The information at MAG Zrt has not been confirmed because we have not been able to reach the authority.
You don't need a suit
The ILO building not only saw the NF<0xC3><0x9C> as a guest, but also the Ministry of Justice and Order, which organized the Luca-Day Ball on December 7th instead of Christmas.
Their parents did not ask for money for the use of ILO terms.
Five hundred people took part in the ball.
The party started with the minister's greeting, and after dinner, he could dance to live music.
The [origo] question was reported: the balloon was not mandatory at all in the evening dress or the suit.
Puritan will be held at the health, employment and municipal fairs.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration in its own building for the workers for 400 000 HUF.
However, Lamperth M<0xC3><0xB3>nika, Minister of Labour, is officially waiting for her colleagues at the end of the year, not for Christmas.
Hundreds of eighty guests are expected, who, the press department said, will only get coffee and a baguette, bringing the party out of 350,000 HUF.
However, the Minister of Local Government in Bajnai Gordon will simply drive with his colleagues in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is holding a Christmas meeting in its own large room, with 436 workers waiting for it.
Every guest wants 2500 forints for the Christmas party - the sum of a swedish bet and a car seat are included.
Since Veres J<0xC3><0xA1>nos was the minister, the PM’s workers have been Christmas-like every year.
However, there will be no party atmosphere, the office will be strengthened not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time.
On January 20th, the Ministry of Agriculture will give a New Year's reception, and the Ministry of Agriculture will miss Christmas.
The bet is held in the Vajdahunyadvar, the V<0xC3><0xA1>rosliget, and it is estimated that 1000 HUF per 100 guests per person will be allocated.
This, according to the press department, will be a very simple admission, to which only foreign diplomas accredited to Hungary are official.
These annual receptions begin with a brief ministerial welcome and end with a recaptured wall.
There is no Christmas party at all at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture - the [origo] was announced in the relevant press departments.
The price of the official Christmas of the Environmental Protection Archive could not be stated in the press department.
In all, more than four hundred people were invited to the party, which is held in the Museum of Industrial Art.
The Powers of Giant Strikes Are Gathering
On Friday, their strike committee, which coordinates Monday’s indefinite strike, will be formed by the League of Trade Unions and the National Association of Workers’ Councils.
A protesting general assembly is held on Saturday, and on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the health insurance law - the cessation of work begins.
The action will certainly cause significant disruption in transport, as it will almost completely stop rail transport and will strike at the BKV until 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the League of Trade Unions will discuss the details of Monday’s strike, which was jointly organized by the National Federation of Workers’ Councils.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike committee is also set up, which will coordinate Monday’s actions.
A large protesting assembly will be held on Saturday, and organizations that join the strikes will cease work indefinitely if they are unable to reach an agreement with the helm.
This means that they have not been appointed - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act - the date of the end of the strike that has begun.
If, however, the National Assembly does not pass the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
However, if they vote on the legislation, then the strike committees will come together and decide on the continuation.
On the basis of the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is also conceivable that the Health Insurance Act will be voted on only in the late evening or perhaps at night.
As a result of the strike, which began on Monday, a significant increase in traffic can be expected: more than half of Budapest’s public transport, the Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n companies, are suspended for an indefinite period of time at the railway.
At the same time, there will be road closures in many parts of the country.
A number of trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the strike call, and the list of these is constantly updated on the day of the League.
Some organizations have been on strike indefinitely, while others have announced a temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Free Trade Association of M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not agree on sufficient service, and as the Christmas holidays approached, more and more people are travelling by rail.
According to the previous announcements, they will strike from the plant at the BKV until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., four-month strike from the LIGA Villamos and H<0xC5><0x91>energia-industry Trade Organizations, 2 a.m. and 2-8 a.m.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians strikes nationally, at different times, and in the health and social sector of the SZEF, the Democratic Trade Union of Workers (EDDSZ) is holding a two-day strike.
The four demands put forward by the League are the most important, that the government withdraws its proposal for health insurance reform and allow a new concept to be put into social debate.
The second requirement is to gradually introduce a new way of calculating pensions that will occur from next year.
The third is to ensure that the pension benefits are paid before 2010 so that it is possible to enter the system at work that is worthy of it.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers belonging to the League of Trade Unions (VDSZSZ) does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport for the railway lines, it expects another offer.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard raised the risk of the country
With the support of the Jobbik Movement for Hungary, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August this year, also raised the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division.
In the company’s “risk warning” they wrote: in connection with the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the biggest political risk is that “the erosion of ethnic tensions between the Hungarian Gypsies and non-Gypsies can also be exacerbated by the escalation of tensions between the Hungarian population.”
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Magyar G<0xC3><0xA1>rda is likely to provoke such an action, the research institute added.
As they wrote, all this can be traced back to the oblivion of one of the main Hungarian political actors: "the public discussion of the Roma issue has been handed over to the representatives of radical and extreme political groups who could build the political strategy of the Gypsies".
This deepens the problem, makes it impossible to have a normal conversation, strengthens the extremists, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts occurring – he believes.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Magyar G<0xC3><0xA1>rda, as a result of the large domestic and international media attention, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary from abroad, especially regarding the stability of the country and the faith in its democratic development".
It is recalled that since the autumn of 2006, it has been part of the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary, which has received increasing publicity and momentum, that more than in the summer of 2007, an organization that calls itself a "national self-defense" association in Hungary.
"The common feature of these conspiracies is that they define themselves as a civilian organization while openly announcing the preparation of their members - even armed - for defensive (disaster protection, defense, order protection) tasks, in addition to the police, the army, or the rebels," he added.
They noted that all of this is done in accordance with a method that seeks to put various political efforts into civil action based on the political and partisan opposition of society.
The emphasis on civility and the form of association, therefore, serves not only to avoid the legal proofs of the judicial record in the case of these associations, but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Magyar G<0xC3><0xA1>rda is also a risk-increasing factor in terms of neighbourhood relations.
“In recent months, several neighbouring states have also referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of danger, and some of the political actors of the neighbouring countries have sought to prove their own anti-Hungarian policies by referring to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this may affect the political stability of the region,” he added.
According to the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, so political risks have increased in view of the whole area.
As they wrote, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union of the far-right (BNU).
The foundation of the Bulgarian Guard is based on the mass Roman riots that broke out in one of the districts of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana).
The BNU, taking advantage of this, decided on the establishment of the guardhouse, saying that the organization was aimed at "national self-defense".
In the last 17 years, they believe that there has been a “gypsy terror” in Bulgaria, but the state has remained neutral and indifferent.
They added: the initiative sparked a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As they wrote, the increase in the risk of ethnic clashes indicates that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that resistance suspects are creating their own guard.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard shows similarities with the operation of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot therefore be excluded that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threat by organizing their own self-defense - read the Political Capital Bill.
Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz Attila, Research Director of Political Capital, told the telephony office that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they issue their risk analysis annually, and if they experience one that may affect a change in risk, they will inform the public, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Not everywhere is the red letter of the holiday
In Hungary, the law accurately marks the red letter days, and around the holidays it has become a general practice of working-day planning, from which there will be fewer in the future.
In Europe and America, the holiday is not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes the national and state holiday and the working day.
The working days are mostly associated with ecclesial celebrations, with significant historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year with us: the last day of the new year and the first day of the new year are both working - the last day is just to let the Christmas tree grow.
All year round, we have a total of eleven red-letter celebrations.
The National Day is also the Memorial Day of the Revolution of March 15 and October 23, which commemorates the Revolution of 1848.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1, we celebrate the work, and on November 1 and 2, we remember our relatives and friends who died.
In addition, we have a two-day celebration of Easter, your bun and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on the weekends according to the calendar, day-to-day relocation has become a practice in cases where we would only work for one day before or after the red letter holiday.
True, the price of extended weekends is that we don't stay away from work-school on the previous Saturdays.
The fact that the day immediately before or after the celebration is to be worked out exactly when, for many years, the Minister of Labour has been regulated by a separate regulation.
The law applies to all employers and to the workers employed by them, to the public sector employees and to those in the public service legal relationship.
However, it does not affect the companies and institutions that operate without interruption and, as a result of their destination, the providers that also operate on working days.
This year, only around the end of the year, the working order is changing: from December 24th, life in the country is almost stopped, because, according to experience, the majority of people between Christmas and New Year’s Eve are “slipping” or using their saved freedom for this purpose.
Next year, there will be more holidays in the middle of the week or at the end, so there will be less day shifts than this year.
First, the work holiday is organized around the calendar, so that the workers can stay at home for four days, independently.
The Saturday of April 26th will be a working day in exchange for the Friday of May 2nd.
The second shift will depend on the 23rd of October: on October 18th, you will have to work on Saturday instead of the 24th of Friday.
The end of the year, however, can be held indefinitely on the anniversary of the holiday, since from December 24 there will be a non-stop break almost everywhere, even if it falls on Easter Wednesday.
Six Scary Little Things You Can Do to Hurt Your Colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voicemail messages that we never get, innocent lies that we almost don’t even notice: they “colorize” the workdays.
The question is whether you get used to minor inconveniences or pick up your glove and consciously avoid situations that are misunderstandings that cause anger to others.
I'm guessing.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you I was looking for you from the marketing department," one of your colleagues said.
That's why you left a meeting?
At best, you’re sorry and you’re trying to approve it, or you might call the marketing department to tell you that you forgot to pass on the message (this is a less common solution).
Most of the time, it's a matter of apologizing.
Before you get into embarrassing relief, it’s worth thinking about what it’s like to have unpleasant moments for your colleagues and consciously try to avoid it.
You're borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than touching a piece of paper, office supplies, or your phone, and that's nowhere.
Remember when you put your fire extinguisher on the table last night, but it came out in the morning?
Maybe you'll find out on one of your colleagues' desk what you think is a lost printer?
Don't buy anything from your colleagues without a request, because they'll be rightfully angry at you for stealing our property.
Don’t pocket office envelopes, your post, because it can be uncomfortable if you’re missing out on time, and you need it right away.
Are you complaining about the privacy of your colleagues?
There's no good way to stop the rumor that's already spreading.
Who, with whom, what did you do?
Where and why?
Don’t forget to share your (presumably) private life with your colleagues!
If one of them shares his deepest secrets with you, don't live back with his trust.
Bury what you’ve heard and don’t talk to your colleagues in the distance, even if others know about your co-worker’s work.
You mean an unwarranted patient?
When you call the office and refer to a patient with a sneezing headache because you feel bad or you feel like you’re resting that day; think about doing your job, doing your work unsatisfactory, doing your scheduled work differently.
Don't shoot your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you are not going to go into the office the next day, or you can interfere with something that will make you stay home, signal that your colleagues, and your boss, will not be faced with your lack the next day.
Doubting, sneezing, phone calls
You've been in the business, but you're making a big fuss about it with your colleagues?
Did you accidentally become a victim of a phone conversation that you couldn't have heard better?
Don’t confuse your colleagues with dudeurism, singing, loud conversation (which you’re going over their heads), or foot-slaping, continuous damage, loud dissatisfaction.
They can all be confusing, even if they are not deeply involved in a project (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame others for your mistakes?
If something is not on time, you have forgotten to send an important letter, a message, no other reason for your oblivion!
Don’t refer to your colleagues in the office who may be in a chaotic mood.
Recognize if you've made a mistake, and that's the other side of it, and blow out the chimney.
Ask how you can make up for your mistake, replace the oblivion.
Do you feel too at home in the office?
T-shirts and slippers: comfortable at home, but not in the office!
Then don’t wear comfortable casual clothes if you allow them to work.
Don’t be sloppy, your colleagues, and honor yourself by going into the office in a casual dress – if your job requires it, beautifully, elegantly!
If you want to respond, you are no longer interested
Connection with the car in the usual breakfast box.
There is something special about the radio: the sound of a violin, to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm gonna raise my voice.
The music has become a pace and the bass is next to the previous sounds, and then the female chorus is connected as a real jewel.
Zagar Wings of Love is on Mr2.
For a long time, the musical life of our country has not comforted us with high-quality electronic pop music.
But now it seems that the plug is different when you listen to the new Zagar record.
The appearance of Yonderboi, some of the new and exciting productions coming from the domestic digital underground, is slowly changing overall, and despite the lack of fashion again the guitar-carrying garage rock, the domestic electropop also proves: there is new under the sun.
Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs started from Pécs, and he also played in Yonderboi's orchestra, until - perhaps because two duets did not reach him in a spell - he took his own path.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, which combines jazz, electronic dances, and pop elements, he began to break through when film soundtracks were asked to compose (e.g.
Turkish Ferenc Season).
At first, he was introduced to smaller club formations by a wider audience when wan2 magazine ranked their first album in 2002 as one of the 50 most important domestic albums, and in Yonderboi's company, Zagar was awarded the almost one-of-a-kind, if-a-way market.
Without a doubt, Zagar and the band became "trends", but of course no one asked them if they would like to wear the label.
The band reacted as they should: they made a new, better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, which has just been released, will open up new avenues for them, even though the title itself wants to create continuity with the early years of Pecs.
This was one of the old bands of Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs.
We would have been in the right place by air, by air, by air, but besides the airiness of the music, it has now appeared - according to the spirit of the age, according to the trend - the effect of the louder guitar, the rock and roll.
In these songs, Ligeti Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rgy presented himself at the premiere of the album Millenary, currently working with The Puzzle band in England.
The album also produced a real radio hit, with Mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi playing popular music from the evening of the last day, beginning to smuggle the huge songs of the Wings of Love recorded in his ears with the six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
Is everything all right??
Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs was asked by hvg.hu.
hvg.hu: This new beater now raises the question: how many layers are left to play?
Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs: The definition of a layer does not mean too much to me.
I think there are two kinds of lightboxes; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
The so-called alternative, underground music can also be flat, unspoken, and can also be made purely for sale, which makes them commercial.
But a good pop-up can also come from sincere motivation.
The attitude of the host also works in the spirit of this, regardless of language and country boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially from the west, there are greater traditions of ease.
Not only the age group of ten-five years attends concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the light music changes that are taking place around them, because they are also considered part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B: Of course, it’s a good feeling that more and more people are going to our concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
Music isn’t for purpose, it’s for some reason.
The role of the audience is more noticeable in concerts, where the effect is already working on each other, but this is only in the unfathomable changes of the moment.
Still, I've noticed that if you want to respond to the audience, you're not interested anymore.
hvg.hu: How much do you plan to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He's a soloist, and he's built his career calmer than us.
Zs.B.: We don’t really go his way, no matter how often they try to explain it to our music.
We’re team players who trust the other person’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work was compared to the music of Yonderboi, as many of us moved out of his band and started on a different path.
hvg.hu: The Wings of Love ranked first on Mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi's top list.
Many people have heard the name Zagar for the first time about this number.
Did you consciously open up to a wider layer with the more popular style?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a hit, and then sell the record.
This song is about more.
It was the finale of the album, which we tried to solve the vocals on the album and the more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why exactly did they - what was the steering wheel?
Zs.B.: The idea was to be a gospel-like choir.
It was then that the idea was to compose this choir from the sound soloists of our own home music scene.
This was the composition of the six choirs - Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Hodosi Enik<0xC5><0x91> [Neo], Németh Juci - which we then named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is this the song you designed or designed by the girls on it?
Zs.B.: The number has been in the instrumental version for a long time, and then when the record material came together, we thought that this number needed something else.
He was attracted to the accordion so that my singing could be heard.
That night, I sang the song that the girls later learned to sing.
Almost the first and most frighteningly spontaneous thing came.
I remember, he was very upset at the time, but of course the Diva needed him.
It wouldn't have worked so hard with my voice.
hvg.hu: Both the record and the concert seemed to be in the background of the girls.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay’s short soloist), they don’t have their own role, they sing together completely and they’re not louder than music, so music doesn’t just accompany their songs.
They were in the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were behind was purely due to technical problems.
However, it is clear that we did not want to share solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting our ego a little bit about where it came from, where it's from, just letting those certain wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
HVG: What did you do the most?
Zs.B.: In the music-making process, none of them were really, rather, more difficult pieces in mixing.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on a racetrack, or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work on the groove for a long time, then pretty slowly everything stood in place, like a jigsaw game.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite number on the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the concert and with the fact that I’ve “lost” the record.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The traitor broker risked billions due to a sense of inferiority.
He's a cold-blooded asshole.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French Société Générale, named his former employee, Jerome Kerviel.
Because of Kerviel, he lost almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel was not a talent at all but a great player who wanted to imitate his colleagues.
In contrast to other banks, he acknowledged in time the crisis of the U.S. mortgage market.
"Reduced mental capacity," he said of his superiors informing the police.
However, as reported by French firm Le Monde, Kerviel’s statement shows that he made a profit of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion from his business at the end of last year.
The crisis is not only in America
"I just wanted to make money from the bank," he said.
In the summer, he managed to find half a billion euros in the American crisis.
The opportunity was already at the beginning of the year.
In February, news emerged that there will be problems with so-called sub-prime mortgages provided to customers struggling with low-income or previous cancellation problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe this and put him on a good horse.
Last year’s profit reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion.
“When I was looking for the first half-billion, I didn’t know how to report it,” Kerviel admits, adding that he didn’t keep anything to himself.
In his testimony, he admits that he faked his reports so that it wouldn’t happen.
He has also managed to take over his bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange is also interested in his business.
The risk was profit.
Were you afraid everything would turn out?
No, I'm not.
"I thought the fact that I was looking for $1.6 billion to the bank would reassure them."
Where did he want to put so much risk?
He gradually reached his position.
After graduating from the University of Lyon, he worked at the Société Générale bank since 2000.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker and became an independent broker in 2005 with a yearly salary of $90,000.
He knew that he would never seek as much as anyone else.
“In 2005, during my first conversation, I knew they were looking at me with the wrong eye.
It is also because of my excellence, my professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
It wasn’t long after his arrival that the first big success came.
Allianz's shares were in demand as it raised half a billion euros in the fallout from the London bombings.
And this started his avalanche - he wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But their bosses were supposed to know everything, or they'd rather be guessing.
"While I was looking for money, they opened their eyes."
But there was a blow at the beginning of the year.
He lost a billion euros in a single day.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to drown.
When he started working on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion because of it.
And how did they get there?
He became a suspect because of his freedom.
"Last year I only took four days off.
The broker who has no freedom is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to look into his or her reports,” Kerviel said.
Czech Republic is likely to acquire 365 billion
The Czech government’s ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic could receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>365 billion) in the coming years.
The total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013 is approximately the total amount.
The seven operational programmes in the regions will cost approximately SEK 125 billion.
Czech companies will receive a sum of around 100 billion kroner from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion kroner, is for transportation.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents 22 per cent of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
This money will increase the state fund of the Transport Infrastructure, which will grow to 90.8 billion kroner next year.
The Entrepreneurial and Innovation Program helps entrepreneurs and companies to gain the tools they need to invest in innovative businesses.
Companies should also be provided with resources for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries in terms of earning money from EU funds so far.
Nicaragua's ex-president sentenced to 20 years in prison by court
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday granted a 20-year prison sentence to Arnold Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, the former president of the country, who was convicted in 2003 of financial fraud of $100 million (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison, and he lived in a house in custody near the capital.
Whether the former leader of this Central American country from 1997 to 2002 will return behind bars is not yet clear, according to the AP news agency.
The president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Perez, said it would be up to the prison authorities to decide whether to allow German punishment at home or whether to go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Germany that government money was regularly referred to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These fictitious companies and their accounts were, in fact, their relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money was spent on the foundation, which he founded to finance the 2001 German election campaign.
They have left our budget well.
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
Why is this budget so special?
This is the first budget drawn up by this government, adopted by a coalition majority, without the support of opposition.
This year, it went through last year with the support of the Social Democrats, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party were not allowed to accept it.
There was no drama this time, in contrast to the pre-voting, distrust of the government.
The House of Representatives has accepted this generally ignored, although the most influential law is the law.
This is a certain contradiction.
All governance begins and ends with certain chapters and paragraphs of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the power struggles of the government and the opposition.
This is more rewarding in the press, so you get a lot more attention in the media.
The debates of politicians are much more interesting to the public than mere figures.
The state budgets of the previous Social-Democratic governments have faced three shortcomings that the 2008 budget cannot solve at the same time:
The first of these is a high proportion of the mandatory so-called client spending law, which not only represents pensions but also social benefits, which was approved last year by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M's silent "collision" before the elections
The second is due to the lack of deficits in the economy.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the deficits of the budgets of cities and corridors.
However, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
It is under public and relatively controlled control.
Timed bombs are deficits in the budget of cities and corridors.
A number of mayors could also raise money for other investments, other than taxes, levies and bank loans, without a doubt they often issued bonds with which their townhouses were disproportionately sold.
In recent years, these debts have been eliminated by the massive sale of shares in energy and other distribution networks, which have been received from the state from privatizations.
There is no such source at the moment.
If we rely solely on official and verifiable facts, we will determine that:
Like the rest of the world, our economy has been going through a growth phase for a few years, with which the Czech Social Democratic Party is constantly praising.
This was a unique opportunity for governments to put public funding in order.
Instead, however, the country is increasingly being plunged into debt.
The rest of the countries, with two exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, were much more rationally farmed than the Czech Republic.
This is, above all, a huge disgrace to previous governments.
We belong to those countries that are least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
That is why there is no need, for example, for huge social programs, which, unfortunately, have taken on a gigantic scale in recent years.
Although this year it has managed to eliminate some of the unreasonable populist spending approved before the elections, even if in the near future there will be no way to extend the limit of retirement and pension reform, it will actually end in this country, although it will be an age-old one.
With a little exaggeration, it can be said that the majority of the taxed money from government politicians usually becomes their mechanical distributors of pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the elimination of normal expenditure by contracting expenditure.
The 70 billion-dollar deficit planned for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if the previous governments had not done everything that could have been done in the last decade.
If we don't want to really make it happen that mere officials become the politicians of the ruling party, then we need to be patient, and we need to rest assured that this is not too strong for the preparation of further reform laws, and that the coalition government, which is aware of it, can only be given to those who are aware of it.
This is the only way to ensure that a balanced budget can be reached gradually.

The banks want to solve the crisis.
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the United Kingdom, Switzerland, as well as the central banks of Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis of the money markets.
In this way, the money markets will cost more than $100 billion through the stock market.
In this market, banks raise the interest rate for which they are prepared to lend money.
The U.S. Federal Reserve, for example, is spending $40 billion on the stock market, while another twenty-four are making it accessible to the European and Swiss central banks.
After the September 11 attacks, it is now the first time that the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step should solve the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend to,” Bernard Baumohl, a consultant at Economic Outlook Group, wrote in a customer report.
"Coordinated action by central banks in the United States has reduced the likelihood of a recession from about 65 percent to about 50 percent," Baumohl said in a statement.
In the United States, banks have already lost more than $60 billion due to unrepayed loans.
Analysts are expecting even more billions of dollars in losses.
“The central banks can really refrain from what could happen even if they decided to follow such a procedure,” said Kieran Davies, chief executive of ABN Amro.
It seems like the situation is really bad,” he added.
The central banks are afraid that if the banks themselves can be difficult to access to the loans, they will also give loans to their customers more expensive.
This would reduce the need and put the U.S. economy into recession with the possible consequences for the economic growth of the entire world.
The central banks subsequently decided that the so-called LIBOR, the so-called London interbank offering interest rate reduction, was not successful, which is used for lending money on the interbank market.
This meant that the banks were constantly afraid of borrowing from each other, despite the fact that the central banks of the US, Canada and the UK also reduced their interest rates a few times during the fall.
"This will have a similar effect on further interest rate cuts," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the move by central banks contributes to the resolution of the crisis, as it does not solve its underlying problem, the collapse of the U.S. real estate market.
Klaus: The Incredible Debates of Ecologists
Global climate change is the biggest threat to developing countries in the world.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus once again gave an opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time, he criticized the UN’s International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
The book Blue, presented in Vienna, was not the green planet, so it made the debates of ecologists incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is made up of a special mixture of representatives of governments and civil organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality that accompanies it.
“The debate there is absolutely without the structure, it’s just dumping with words that are substitutes for solving the current problems,” Klaus said.
During the presentation of the Czech President's book, he stressed that his topic is very important and therefore he is so committed to this topic.
He expressed his satisfaction that the book would also appear in German translation, because, as he said, "I often only encounter caricatures of my opinion."
Now you can read your unbiased opinion.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, in his opinion he had sufficient grounds to write such a book.
Since he has been able to follow and discuss professional opinions, he has experienced as an academic in statistics and also as an economist.
At the end of the book, he pointed out as thesis that the effects of climate change are constantly changing, that is, changes are normal, and there is no consensus opinion among all scientists that the consequences of current changes are not too big and severe, because they are not significant.
Moreover, as a person with experience in the field of totalitarianism, it is unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which it perceives as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained to the questions of the attendees that "it is not against the reasonable protection of the environment, but against military environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits."
Klaus spoke on a similar topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people were unable to exchange their passports.
Six hundred thousand drivers delayed the deadline and were unable to replace their old license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can still apply for an exchange so that the authorities are able to issue the new licence in time by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will leave without valid entitlement.
According to the authorities, the license has not been replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While the tenders represent a sharp drop in interest in the exchange of licences, the authorities in the capital have been burdened with requests for licence-exchange, for which interest has increased this week.
The mayor's office accepts about 2,000 clients a day.
You have to be in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, the licence has not been replaced by around 140000 drivers.
The exhibition of a new license takes 20 days.
However, the new licence may also be required for a five-day short period.
In this case, however, the driver will have to pay an additional five hundred crowns.
Those drivers who are not able to carry out the mandatory change of licence by the end of the year and start their journey with an invalid licence are threatened with a penalty from January onwards.
The offender must pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police may also order the dismissal by agreement.
In the case of administrative dismissal, the penalty is 2500 kroner.
Based on previous information received from the town hall, you can also get a penalty for not travelling anywhere.
It is said that you can pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The ministry had earlier called on the authorities to be vigilant and to impose fines of up to a thousand crowns.
According to Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, tens of thousands of fines do not threaten anyone.
He thinks the license is a document in which people can decide whether they want to or not.
This is not a personal certificate that must be valid for everyone.
Those of you who don't want to drive anymore should give up your license.
It is enough to take it or it is recommended to send it by post to the appropriate office.
At the end of the year, the licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will no longer be valid.
However, drivers of motor vehicles should also gradually replace the other types of licences as well.
Those with documents from 1994 to 2000 may be replaced for a further three years.
The licences issued between 2001 and 2004 shall only be valid in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents.
The court reduced the punishment of Berdycchel's interrogators.
Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k were police officers, who were suspected of complicity with David Berdych's criminal gang, and were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison.
In this regard, the Prague Supreme Court has decided to have a definitive effect, which has reduced the punishments for one of them, for two years for the masiks.
Investigators of the Organized Crime Division in Prague were originally threatened with 14- and 12-year-old jails.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today’s decision, the review can only be appealed to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdychet is also suspected in this case, he is only awaiting a first-degree verdict.
In other cases, he has received more than 16 years of punishment.
You can't have any more.
In January, the District Court found 19 people mainly involved in criminal robberies, of which the Supreme Court today dealt with 16 appeals.
The majority of the defendants have since the beginning of the investigation ruled that this is a speculative case.
According to the Central Czech Senate, members of the police, after the Berdycchel agreement, among other things, saw the criminals with information from police sources, covered the individual robberies and helped the gang avoid the criminal offender.
That's why the gang gave 30 percent of the loot to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>.
The lawsuit is about the gang's crimes between 1999 and 2001.
These are, in particular, kidnappings, whose victims have often suffered serious harm to health, but also abuse of the rights of a public official and non-authorised maintenance of arms.
Because the police found illegally held pistols, steel bullets, laser pointers, or machine gun during the House Investigations.
The gang allegedly confiscated tens of millions of crowns from the robbers.
A gang of twenty members has already been found guilty by the courts in this proceeding of other Berdych’s kidnappings and many others.
Further members of Berdych's environment are also testifying before the court in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The first-degree trial has so far prevented Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Put<0xC3><0xA1> and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in preliminary detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Account for the exchange of children: 12 million
Igor Veleba, the lawyer for the injured families, is demanding a pain allowance of NOK 12 million from the hospital in Treb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> for the children who were born.
Three million for mothers, two million for fathers, and one million for children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l Veleba, did not agree with the proposal.
"We reject that demand because it's too much," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after today's hearing.
"In order to form an opinion on the opposition, we need the expert opinion drawn up by the opponent.
We will determine if there is any usable value at all.
But we maintain our opinion that this will be measurable for everyone in the hundreds," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l stressed.
He believes that the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablonov family wanted one million crowns for each month until they raised their own biological daughter.
Veleba served as an expert judge on the basis of the compensation negotiations, which were developed by the Motol University Hospital in Prague.
According to the children's parents, psychologists and psychiatrists have suffered various degrees and depths of mental damage and stress.
The stress situation was better tolerated by the men, even if they were met with eye-sight so that they did not prevent the exchange of newborns.
Women are fighting worse with the update of the trauma they’ve been through and what’s going on right now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikolai were replaced by sisters at their births in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their blood-based parents - Nikola <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>ké to P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice, Veronika Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanov to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina’s district manager, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il, gave the families 100,000 crowns at the end of October to replace their expenses, which were caused by the failure of the Treb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ské hospital, which is run by the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic have compulsory health insurance under the provisions of the law.
In the event of a mistake, they should reach the reserve table, in exceptional cases they can ask the founder for help.
The courts have so far granted relatively low compensation to the people, the amounts being calculated on the basis of several hundred thousand, in exceptional cases a few million kroner tables.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the lawsuit for the title of the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko.
According to the judge of the Ostrava District Court, although he first used the name of the king of Lachi, the project was worked out by a team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, who worked with the actor for many years.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka did not participate in the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about the fact that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are living in the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
In the words of the Kingdom of Valachi, the actor-comedy comes to mind.
This opinion is also shared by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We have almost 10 years of work behind us.
Investigate the money and invent actions,” he said.
He thinks life's worth the money.
“Years later, they realized that the project was successful and they could win something from it.
They want to live out of our work,” he added.
The Profitable Business
According to the court, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka used the name King of Walachi for the first time on a television show.
In 1993, Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD> was crowned.
At that time, however, this did not depend on the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing the passports of the people of Lachi.
The original student-training action became a business and profitable entrepreneurial activity, after which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> founded the establishment of the society of the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko.
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to give his name and signature in the passports, and even when he visited his farm and theater performances, he offered discounts to their owners.
Who will occupy the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> himself only used the idea, which Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka brought to the public in the mansion.
"The popularity of Boleslav Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka certainly helped the project of the Kingdom of Valachi," the judge said.
However, he added that the spirit of the project was the intensively engaged Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team.
The cooperation of the parties now united continued until 2000, when the official coronation of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> Polivka was organized in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Since then, however, disputes between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> have escalated to the rescue of "the eternally elected King of Boleslav".
In the kingdom, Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> took over the leading role at the initiative of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> as mother queen.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> filed a lawsuit against him and his associates, which the court rejected today.
The battle planned by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> could bring light to the debate for the throne and for the queen.
This fight should be a new king.
The details and the date have not yet been disclosed.
“We didn’t want to catch anything.
This should be something like a Slovak royal court case.
The king should be elected for a fixed period of time.
Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can also apply calmly," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
The 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot test: missing prejudices
To be honest, I've never liked the Peugeot 206.
The characteristics of the walk are nothing special, the quality of the change, the driving and the production can often be indicated below average.
But the successor to the market is already present, the Peugeot 207 is significantly better.
And the truck called SW goes one step further, so for me there's nothing left but to think about it.
For example, when I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained in the back of the seat to the head.
This time, the complaint is over here, as the bodywork of the van means that the two-meter-high giants are no longer suffering in this regard.
F<0xC3><0xBC>rgen in the world
I'm going through the interior quickly, so I don't repeat myself many times.
It is a relatively successful design, where my only excuse is for the poor console.
Here I would appreciate some more designer inventions, if the exterior of the car is already so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and where are the times when we complained about the short bottom of the seat or the armrests.
Side-by-side driving has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As for the space, the increase in the size of the bodywork can also be felt here.
After that, the head of the van disappears from the mentioned few places.
Suitcases in the luggage compartment
The main thing in this vehicle is the luggage rack.
This is very accessible (even thanks to the foldable back window) and I have to evaluate it in a wide range.
The empty spaces are equipped with our compartments, which are ideal compromises.
They are not in the way, they can be pulled apart and, at the same time, they can handle more difficult objects.
But let's stay at the volume for a while.
This is based on the tables in the basic arrangement of 428 l, which is a rather average value versus competition.
However, in the Czech Republic it is not the most sought after car of this class - the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation product in the young Boleslav, we find that Peugeot is well behind the noticeably many 52 liters.
For a foreign holiday or when installing a baby stroller, this value is almost critical.
But if I should highlight the positives, then I still have to mention the almost completely straight floor after the backrests of the second row have fallen or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was equipped with a 1.6-litre, 88-kW four-cylinder, anti-tank engine.
And to be honest, that's what it should look like for the thousand-hundred that drives the family hatchback.
It's quiet, it's low in consumption and it's mostly pulling.
If we compare it to the <0xC5><0xA0>koda match, which often feels like you're putting a rod in your bumper, then I can only be happy about it.
The price sucks
The price of the car is not cheap.
However, we need to remember that we tested a car with a spacious interior and very good engine.
The car still leaves with a four-cylinder foreign engine for CZK 329,900.
The car starts from 410 990 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is already quite a lot.
The tested Premium equipment will throw the equipment away with an additional CZK 80,000.
However, we still had our headlights, our automatic air conditioning, our automatic window wiper start, our rear windows also had electric remote control....
In other words, the car will cost 531 900 CZK by train.
That’s a lot, but count on Fabia’s additional equipment and get very similar results.
So there's nothing left but a decision on the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is not successful
In British schools, more and more are Eastern European children, which has raised concerns among locals about the further development of local schooling.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases when disputes between the children of immigrants and the children of the natives have become violent.
The problems related to the integration of Eastern European children are well illustrated by a case in North Kent, where disputes between their places and Slovak immigrants are intensifying.
Conflicts and bonds between students are already characterized by the relationships of the parents.
The situation soared that the police in Chatham detained a Slovak woman who hit a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The perpetrator defends himself by insulting him with racist tits.
The police were forced to proceed even after a 12-year-old girl attacked a Slovak immigrant.
The girls are said to have shoved the man with racist remarks and thrown him with stones.
"When we were staying home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started to spit on us.
When I told him to stop this, he hit us with apples and circles, and then he discovered his naked back," the mother of Slovak students wrote in a letter to The Times.
There are complaints on both sides.
One of the locals described the debate on the issue of East European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above indicate that in British schools the tension between locals and immigrants is beginning to develop.
In the UK, there are 70,000 Slovaks looking for work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students go to British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean.
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, this can be accomplished if you answer correctly.
The golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, calm like a fisherman.
Palm trees and all inclusive on the beach with pizzerias offering pizza, ice cream or mahogany cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
You can find it in the Caribbean islands in a complete and even richer list.
On an island, however, you can find much more, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was the cradle of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a treasure trove and transshipment site, which the Spaniards kidnapped in America and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, was built because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (primarily sistema), was welcomed into Cuba and supported drugs, gambling, prostitution.
For example, he was among his guests.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tower houses were built, and cars were transported on the wide beams, which became a cult symbol of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his own yacht in Coj<0xC3><0xAD>mar.
The walls of Bodeguita del Medio are decorated with signatures of American show business stars and politicians.
What about today?
The Wall of Bodeguita in Havana can also be supplied by hand.
In the bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel you can enjoy cocktails as desired.
And the cult cars of the '50s are still in Havana today, as they are once exported and young people have long been trapped in this salty and wet air.
Although the oldest part of Havana was largely destroyed, there is nowhere else in the area as beautiful a colonial monument as there is.
Other places are becoming more and more popular, such as Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides the money it needs so much, its development has been given a green path.
Over the last fifteen years, not only new hotels have been built in Havana, but also in Varader, on the coast of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers a unique image in the world, which is mainly appreciated by the lovers of attraction.
From their extensive plantations, the sugarcane was transported to the sugar plantations by steam and power lines.
Their motor parks have not been renewed for decades, so machines operating there can be seen, whose contemporaries can only be seen in museums.
Where do we go?
Most of the most famous places in Cuba are not to be missed.
So you don't have to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we should just remind ourselves that there is a museum on the Hemingway side of the already mentioned, and those who love the writer should not miss a visit to this museum.
The Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba in the western part of the island.
Her belly is growing out of mascara.
Beech formations, beech-mountains, and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and accumulate fertile soil in their voids, thanks to which the scattered shoots are covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
With the final form, you can meet when you visit one of the Havana cigar manufacturing plants.
Some might also find it interesting that there was filmed the episode of Major Zeman's Chile.
Trinidad (country)
An ancient city that was founded not long after the island colonization of the Spanish.
The slave trade and the sugar trade have brought fame and glory.
The economy is a body that is not too big in the beauty and monumentality of the city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, which was heavily influenced by later French colonists, has changed almost nothing in four centuries.
Trinidad is so remote between the plain of Escambray and the sea that even in the 1950s there were no roads that would have connected this region to the rest of the country.
That certain isolation has helped to keep it out of the way.
They didn’t build anything there, so they didn’t collapse, everyone was happy that there was a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth looking at the area's interesting places such as the Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n coast or the Sugar Farms Valley.
In the evening, you can go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which wakes up after dark, where the music will be quiet only in the morning.
Baracoa
The city in the eastern part of Cuba is considered some of the most beautiful cities.
I'm sure this opinion is already influenced by the road itself.
The two roads leading from Guantanamo must fight high and steep mountains, which are almost impenetrable by human activity.
Thanks to its untouched nature, Cuba’s eastern tongue has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Here is made the best chocolate, in the church there is a cross of Columbus (in reality, it was made a hundred years after Columbus sailed) and from the hill where the former castle stood and nowadays the El Castillo hotel stands, some of the most famous of which can be seen.
The coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Meastro plain, the Bay of Discno and the Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the Cuban patron saint of Caridad del Cobra, the Santer<0xC3><0xAD>a, the African religion, which is believed to be the descendants of former slaves.
As they say, it’s better to see it once.
Afghan Allies Are Passive, U.S. Claims
Few soldiers and the lack of the necessary equipment influence the course of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.
Defense Minister Robert Gates said NATO should outline concrete plans for the coming years.
The Afghan mission is not based on ideas, as the leaders of those countries in Edinburgh, Scotland, whose units are located in the southern part of the country, have stated.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries are also advising on the further plans and coordination of the Allies.
While the United States, with the assistance of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, has called for greater activity by NATO forces this week, the UK considers strengthening the Afghan government and strengthening development assistance as a priority.
“Afghanistan’s development can be tapped, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the public to initiate further development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the U.S. government, the activity of Afghan insurgents has been the strongest in the last five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 per cent compared to last year and by 60 per cent in the southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, roughly one-quarter of them in the southern regions.
However, according to the United States, the Allies have also reached their limits in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In particular, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts were asked to be trained by Afghan teams.
“We need to think hard about specific goals for the future and about ways to achieve them,” Gates said.
Jaap de Hoop, NATO’s secretary-general, spoke in a similar spirit today.
"I'm not happy with what's happening in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
“We have about ninety percent of the troops and the equipment we need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of a three-day conversation with the Japanese commander in Tokyo.
Who's Passive
There have also been discussions among the participating countries over the past few months as to whether all the allies are providing the maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are in relatively large numbers present in Afghanistan.
However, they were deployed in areas where the least amount of violence and fighting demands are not as high against them as they are against us in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
This week, the Sun British newspaper called the German soldiers "sluts."
"Afghan sunflowers have been relaxed: The Germans are playing as long as our sons are fighting," Sun wrote in a caption with a photo of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild counterattacked and published a photo of a British team's rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The state debt in 2009 will reach the equivalent of one million euros.
Each exchange receives 84,000 kroner of state debt.
Total debt reached SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government plans to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion kroner, thanks to better development of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic reached SEK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
During the nine months of this year, it rose by 40.2 billion kroner.
As of June, however, it has fallen by 13.4 billion kroner.
The Ministry of Finance today confirmed the state debt data from the beginning of October.
There are more debts than 84,000 kroner in each of the cheques.
Last year, the state owed more than 11 billion kroner.
"For now, it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit next year, we could exceed the limit of one million crowns in 2009 alone.
Next year, the debt will be around 900 billion and one billion kroner,” David Marek, a Patria Finance analyst at iHNed.cz, told the iHNed.cz server.
Similarly, Vladimir Pikora, an analyst with Next Finance, sees this: “During 2009 we will be able to make a billion transitions.
That exactly when, for the time being, depends on the next budget.
If you were to make sure that the situation in the area of politics would change, politicians would be prepared to save more, this could be delayed until 2010.
But I don’t expect that change,” he said.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Growing Debts
The state debt is formed by the central government’s debts, which are primarily formed by the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The government debt is financed by banknotes, government bonds, direct loans, or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic sales so far this year have grown from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
The state's foreign debt has so far grown from 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion kroner.
At the end of September, the so-called sellable government debt reached NOK 803.3 billion and decreased by NOK 13.7 billion from June.
The average amount of government debt has increased to 6.5 years.
“In the first quarter of the year, debt rose by 13 per cent, which is really high enough compared to the economy’s growth.
It is interesting that the increase is generated primarily in the case of bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
The bad thing is that debt is rising, but on the other hand, it shows why it will be traded if the pension reform comes here," Pikora said in a statement.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the 2007 management of the state debt show that the government is planning to borrow NOK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion kroner thanks to better development of the state budget.
The amount is mainly made up of the state budget deficit, which this year is likely to reach the estimated SEK 76 billion instead of the estimated SEK 91.3 billion.
In addition, a maximum of SEK 13.3 billion planned by the Czech Consolidation Agency, a pension payment of SEK 10 billion, a financing of SEK 43 billion in government bonds, and a loan of EUR 1 million from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher appears today in front of a potato court for the name given to a plush maccoon
A court on Thursday night sentenced a British teacher to 15 days in prison and to be expelled from the country for violating Islam in Sudan, his lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her 6-7-year-old students to name a plush cat as Mohamed, but the Islamic religion prohibits any depiction of her prophet.
Such an action can be punished with a whiplash.
The 54-year-old British woman, who is a teacher at the Unity High School in Kart<0xC3><0xBA>m, was arrested Sunday in her own apartment. Under Section 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, she was accused of insulting Islam and inciting rebellion after several students were accused of raping her.
The story began in September, when the teacher asked his 6-7-year-old students to choose a name for the class plush cat.
“The children proposed a total of eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohamed,” said Robert Boulos, director of the school.
In the end, 23 out of 20 children voted for the name Mohamed.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the prophet of Islam, but he is also a very common Christian name in Sudan.
The children then made a joint diary with the photo of the mak<0xC3><0xB3> and with the inscription "My Name is Mohamed".
The problem is that any depiction of the prophet is considered to be a violation of Islam, but it is not a sign of the name of the Makkah.
One of Gillian Gibbons, a fellow Muslim teacher at the same school, said that she knew him well, and that the teacher would never have done anything that would offend any religious convictions. He thought it was just a "irreparable mistake" to say: "I'm sorry, I'm not sorry.
Many students of the teacher agree with this opinion. We think the teacher "does very well with the children" and "never talks about religion in the classroom".
Remember that Mohamed is also the second most popular Christian name in the UK, and there are 14 different spellings in English.
This is one way of expressing respect for the prophet so often chosen by Muslim families. (This name is often given to the first-born child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of the name of the cross?
Can you use this name as a game?
This is obviously a matter of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last Vienna trial on Wednesday.
The end result: failure.
The meeting between the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians ended unabated on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, the sixth and last meeting on the future status of the separatist province.
“It is unfortunate that the parties did not reach an agreement on the status,” said the EU diplomat, Wolfgang Ischinger, in a Vienna press release.
U.S. Ambassador Frank Wisner stressed that peace in the region is "at risk" and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue even after negotiations.
“In the near future, there will be no need to refrain from violence, but there will be a very difficult period,” he said, stressing the “expression of tensions.”
Mediation ends on December 10th.
On Monday, he last visited Serbia and Kosovo as a liaison troika, which included the European Union, the United States of America and Russia.
The future of Albania’s residential region can be clarified in 90 per cent after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Aleksandar Bocan-Harcsenko submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
A meeting in Baden, near Vienna, has reported on the sixth and final session of the negotiations since the United Nations reconvened the troika in August last year.
The Americans and Europeans believe that their broadcasting task will be completed on December 10.
The Russians, who have already postponed the issue of Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, have insisted that negotiations continue even after the expiry of the deadline.
“Russia was committed and that will remain the negotiating solution, along with the compromise,” Bocan-Harcsenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
Since Kosovo has been under UN control for 8 years, the Western powers believe that independence under the supervision of the EU is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was ready for a unilateral declaration of independence if the Security Council did not decide in her favour.
Belgium would continue to support greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach an agreement," said the president of Kosovo's independent province, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden, where "the last chance talks" have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, the former commander of the Kosovo uprising and the future prime minister of the province, also expressed his regret.
However, he added that his idea of Belgrade’s autonomy “would be a continuation of the past that has been rooted in murder and deportation.”
"Domin<0xC3><0xB3> effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic said the compromise was still possible and warned the majority of Kosovo's Albanians about the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade is considered to be a “domino effect” because of the independence wars of the 1990s, which are still unstable in the region.
"For Serbia, this does not rule out the possibility of compromise," Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation again called for the decision to be exclusively to the Security Council, where the Russian Federation has veto power.
"The Kosovo Parliament will be the last word"
"For Serbia, only a solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“The negotiations have been going on for two years.
They have to do the same where they started: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that "the Kosovo parliament will be the last word". He vowed that the unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanians is made on the basis of "agreement" with the Western powers.
Bush Urges Agreement Between Israel and Palestine
President George Bush, at the opening of the International Peace Conference in Annapolis, Maryland, announced on Tuesday that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
Bush said in a statement that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin negotiations with their people to finalize the 60-year-old debate.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush promised to support them in every possible way in signing the "peace treaty" in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians will have to account for the "terrorist networks" and Israel will have to abandon its colonial activities, Bush said, and reminded the two sides of their obligations under the "peace plan" adopted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the Abbas-led talks between the Palestinian Authority and Israel were aimed at "signing a peace treaty with which all dependent problems, including central issues, are being resolved."
The latter are concerned with three comfy issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: the future borders of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees displaced from their homes during the 1948 conflict who lived in the territory of the present-day state of Israel.
Abbas, who spoke after the US president, insisted that future negotiations should be "global and in depth" and should address all areas of regulation, such as "Jerusalem, the refugee and the water borders", the water borders, etc.
Olmert, who then stepped up to the summit, promised that future negotiations would be "direct and ongoing" and that he would seek to "end them in 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set fire to the realization of the two-state vision of Palestine and Israel.
Saudi Arabia said it had received a promise from Bush to do so before it had decided to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia (whose participation in the Annapolis was credited with Washington’s success), with the support of all Arab countries, has launched a plan that guarantees peace to Israel if it takes its place in exchange for all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis "means an answer in the history of the Middle East, especially because at its root it grips the problem and focuses on central issues," the Saudi prince said in an interview with the Saudi-owned Arabic daily.
According to the prosecutor, it is not the responsibility of the police.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usual with news of this nature, the official position and the speech contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data from the National Police General Inspectorate (IGPN), a police car passed on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel a few minutes after 17 hours.
"The car was patrolled, so it was not in action. It went 40-50 km/h at speed, without sirenization" - we learned from a police source.
The young man without the two helmets drove at "high speed" a green, "not included in the official register, therefore not usable in road traffic" (see below) with a Kawasaki-branded engine.
“Because the right-hand rule was not respected, the engine hit the left side of the police car,” a police officer said.
The results of the alcohol test carried out on the passengers of the vehicle were negative.
It shows well the strength of the collision, that the beginning of the car is bent, the wind-shielded star is shot and the bumper is lowered.
Pontoise’s public prosecutor, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se de Givry, said in an extraordinary statement this morning that the IGPN and the Val-D’Oise County Public Security Directorate had been entrusted with the investigation, which was “helped by the people who had been negligently assisted.”
During the afternoon, the prosecutor told a press release that at the current stage of the IGPN investigation, the responsibility of the police could be excluded.
According to the prosecutor's office, the three witnesses interviewed on Sunday night confirmed "the police report that the scooter arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car."
On the day of yesterday, a line, which was unquestionably pulled by the pedestrians on the road, showed that the two vehicles were collapsing and running together for a while until the police car was able to stop.
The vehicles have been detained for the purpose of technical investigation.
The bodies of the two victims were subjected to a medical examination yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, the speech spread as a running fire, according to which police quickly left the scene without providing assistance to the two young people.
In this regard, the IGPN carefully states, but excludes that the police would have made "any serious mistake."
"This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation and increased caution in the process," we learned from a police source.
The Libération met with an eyewitness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of his apartment looks exactly at the location.
“With my cousin, who is a hospital nurse, we immediately went to try to resuscitate them,” the witness said.
"But we couldn't do anything."
He then noticed "a police officer who was completely disturbed and healed.
The other two tried to revive one young man, and the fourth phoned.”
There was growing tension among the attendees, as it became clear that the situation of the two young people was hopeless, so the arriving police officers transported their colleagues from the scene by car.
We also know from the witness's statement that the rescue arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left."
Heart massage was also used, but it was not.
“I wouldn’t say that the police didn’t try to help the young people.
Yes, the young people got help.
Firefighters immediately arrived at the scene.
They did everything they could to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police prevented the first demonstrations in the wake of a state of emergency imposed by General Musarraf two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the eastern part of the country, in the city of Lahore, about two thousand people, a lawyer protesting against measures introduced during the state of emergency, were injured by light-gas bombs used by law enforcement forces.
In response, they threw stones at the police, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers have been produced.
Similar incidents took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured the lawyers.
Several people were produced.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court’s registered lawyers have called for a general strike and have filed protests over the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights defenders and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed in order to prevent the assembly.
There were several demonstrations in Multan, in the central part of the country, and in Peshawar in the northwest.
Since Monday, the movement of lawyers has also been supported by the huge Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, which is overwhelming religious parties. Its leader "invited the people to send flowers to those judges who did not agree with the state of emergency, and to those who did not agree with it."
"The promise of Moses is no longer valid."
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly concerned by the exceptional measure announced on Saturday evening.
The Court must declare in the coming days the legality of the re-election of President Musarraf on 6 October by a direct vote.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced by another.
“Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional, and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court,” the president told The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise that he will leave the army to take on the role of civilian president has "lost his value" after introducing the state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
Musarraf had to get rid of his military uniform until November 15, which was his first presidential term.
The Deputy Information Minister also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
Pakistan’s government has otherwise foiled a nationwide speech that said it would appoint President Musarraf as its deputy general in the country.
More than one-third of pregnancies are not planned
This result includes unwanted (24%), or inappropriately or at all unplanned pregnancies.
Even today, more than a third (36%) of pregnancies are unplanned – according to a study by the French National Institute of Demography (Ined) forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law liberalizing contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%), or inappropriately or at all unplanned pregnancies.
According to Ined’s estimates, various contraceptive methods, such as tablets or beeswax, still fail in 5-6 percent of cases.
However, according to the institute, the liberalization of contraception made the "birth control" more effective. The study notes that in 1970, only 5% of women between the ages of 20 and 44 took contraceptive pills, but now this ratio is 6%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancies can be said to be planned.
Every fifth couple of months you plan with accuracy, and if you can, it’s spring, because it’s the most favorable season for a child to receive.
Spectacular improvement at the space station
The astronaut Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular improvement of the station’s unmissable, fragmented solar panel.
This dangerous space proved to be a record in a number of respects: the repair took a very long time, there was very little time to design, and it had to be done with tools "turned off" by spaceships away from residential modules.
The problem arose on Tuesday, when spaceships were separated from Discovery from Harmony module. It is a giant wheel-shaped element that will soon be the site of European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see the framed section).
This module is a kind of gateway to laboratory modules.
However, it is necessary to take care of their power supply.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move one of the modules, which was already on the ISS, to its final place with the help of 17.5 tons of solar panels.
The crew then began to open the 76-meter-wide solar panels of the module.
One of the harmoniously collapsible boards was then breached by one of them about 1 meter in length by a clamped cable.
In order to avoid further injury, the opening of the board was not continued.
The mission of the astronauts was originally to take a control walk from the Discovery spacecraft, and then repair another faulty rotating solar panel. Instead, they had to devote their entire time to repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to hang the show on a 30-metre robotic arm attached to the station's crane.
He's one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
He has a high, strong, extremely skilled, muscular upper body and long arm.
The 46-year-old man, a doctor, had to "handle" the "damaged" solar panel.
After thoroughly measuring the resulting damage, he cut off the faulty cable, and fixed the damaged area with a few "colours".
His work was also helped by another "spacewalker" who stayed near the safe passageway, as well as from inside the other spaceships, including the crew captain, Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockey bot, which was spotted with insulation against hundreds of volts of solar panels, was launched and "cracked" by the station's spaceships.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until his associates fully opened the board, and only after that he packed his tools and returned to the station.
Last afternoon, the spaceships held a half-day break, and then returned to the Discovery Space Cyclone seven days later to begin their scheduled return on Wednesday.
The exchange rate of EADS shares is decreasing
The exchange rate of EADS shares has fallen sharply on the Paris Stock Exchange after the company that manufactures aircraft and defense equipment announced that the delay in the development of the A400M aircraft will result in an additional cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2-1.4 billion.
The exchange rate of EADS shares is currently 21.96 euros after a 4% decrease.
The company was forced to review its forecasts for the 2007 operating result, as the development of the A400M engine is delayed, which is obviously why the aircraft will be delayed later.
The delay in the delivery of the warplane, which was announced in October, "will cost between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 billion and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.4 billion, of which more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 billion will affect Airbus," said the parent company of the European EADS manufacturer.
Due to the rise in these expenditures, EADS is expected to announce new draft figures for its 2007 operating results next Thursday, when it will report quarterly results, the company added, but did not disclose further figures.
The group also indicated that when preparing its new cost estimate, it took into account the six-month delay.
In 2006, EADS’ operating performance decreased by 86%: this was largely due to a delay in the development of the A380, which was also a major financial burden for the company.
The company originally planned to hand over the A400M aircraft to the French Army in October 2009.
Remains of the status quo
Sunday’s elections are not a big surprise: the vast majority of Russians will vote for Putin’s ruling party, the United Russia.
In this regard, the Russian’s need for stability, to say the least, for arbitrary governance, is demonstrated after a strongly manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, the Russian head of state, Vladimir Putin, speaks in a televised message to the voters, which have already been recorded, but the content is still secret.
Putin leads the Kremlin-backed party, the list of candidates for the United Russia, which is expected to win a landslide victory in the elections.
At the reception of the foreign ambassadors yesterday, the behavior of the head of state did not betray anything: he only made further provocations against the interventions of the Western countries, which was a favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know what the price of true democracy is, so we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections, without any kind of violation of the law,” he said.
According to the opposition, however, let me put an end to this situation early.
The opposition condemns the campaign, which they believe has put pressure on voters.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gennagyi Zyuganov, says that "such a dirty election in Russia was not even in Yeltsin's time."
After last weekend’s protests, former chess world leader Garri Kaszparovo was sentenced to five days in prison for not being allowed to perform, and his lawyer said he would not be allowed to visit.
"The Russians still think of it as 'homo sovieticus'"
The predictable election results raise two, even more obvious, questions:
- Who's following Putyn in the head of state?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, which will be held on 2 March 2008, and the candidates can indicate their intention to leave by 23 December.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his term can no longer be extended.
You have no other followers on the scene.
What is the role of Putin in March?
Will he be prime minister?
Or will he decide on the government and the president as the leader of the all-powerful Unified Russia Party or the parliamentary majority?
No matter what happens, the outgoing power will be victorious in both the parliamentary and presidential elections.
This has now become a legacy.
“The Russians are still thinking about the ‘homo sovieticus’ way: they don’t feel like they can control their fate,” says Lev Gudkov, a sociologist at the independent Levada Center.
The history of the University of St. Petersburg goes even further: according to his theory, the country became a Christian five hundred years later compared to Europe, so there is also the development of civil society in the individual. The traditional community spirit of the scholasticism
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putyin retreated to the paternalistic model, which perfectly suited the people. Even more so, because this new kind of paternalism was not accompanied by intimidation, but by a certain economic well-being" - said Maria Lip<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Today, the Russians are "rejecting personal responsibility from themselves", which was quickly demonstrated after the breakup of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all layers of society, even the business world.
The ruling elite was interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of the United Russia are led by 65 governors, who are expelled from the leaders of the 85 Russian regions.
Freedom from the West often embodies chaos, as it did in the 1990s.
Public opinion favours stability in the first place.
In the spirit of this, the Russians do not vote for extreme parties.
Tamara Cherednycsenko, a 54-year-old teacher, says: “Why should we think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why should we replace them?”
Repressive Memories
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Bad Arolsen archive became public, documenting the fate of 17 and a half million victims of the Hitler regime.
The 47 million archival documents, covering 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen in the Hesse region, have so far only been researched for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. only provided a unique and name-calling opportunity for victims or their victims.
In May 2006, eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel, and the United States, agreed to open the archive to researchers and historians.
After each state ratified the treaty, the archive was opened on the day of yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen registry allows historians to conduct research "with the relocation of prisoners, the inhabitants of the camps and the health of forced laborers" - explains Reto Meistern, the leader of the Red Cross Nation.
To date, several states, including Germany, have objected to the publication of the documents, as they contain names and confidential information.
This may include, for example, the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some of the deported victims.
The lists of concentration camps and arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo began to be collected for practical reasons after the war. The aim was to investigate civilians who were deported or sentenced to forced labour on the basis of these reports, and possibly to provide evidence of their internment.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent workers are currently engaged in the processing of tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, part of the scientific community does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be of outstanding importance.
“These documents basically contain nothing new,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Berlin University of Technology’s research centre on antisemitism in 2006.
The EU and India signed the Free Trade Agreement in 2008
The annual turnover of Indo-European bilateral trade is now approaching <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
The EU is India’s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign the free trade agreement in 2008 - said Peter Mandelson, European Trade Commissioner and Kamal Nath, Indian Trade Minister.
The EU’s foreign ministers approved in April last year that the European Commission will launch negotiations to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Union of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The Indo-European Economic Community (EU)
The EU is India’s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also India’s largest foreign investor, but India is only the 9th most important trading partner for the EU, according to European Commission figures.
Peter Mandelson explained that “a free trade agreement can be economically viable for both parties” and “India could thus increase its presence in a flourishing market of 450 million people”.
The top ten commodities exported by India are not mined. Europe is mined in the EU - mined in the EU - mined in the EU - mined in the EU. The two giants, Europe and Asia are mined in the EU - mined in the EU - mined in the EU

The Bank of England offers <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion to the money market for a five-week run
The Bank of England wants to ease its credit-related unrest, which is why it announced on Thursday it is pumping <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion into the money market, which it can do with a 5.75% basic amount and this time, unlike the usual five-week running time.
"We would like to address the concerns that financial market conditions will not be particularly bad at the end of the year, in addition, we would like to see banks more secure to plan their liquidity positions for this period, which is why a significant part of the Bank's reserves for the period of six
According to the bank, <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion) will be available on the market on December 6, at 12:15 p.m. local time. The offer is valid for the basic amount of the ticket bank and the repayment deadline is January 10.
This is the first time that the Bank of England has issued liquid funds for five weeks as part of an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In a press release, the Bank of England added that it is "ready to take further measures" to ensure that interbank loans are eligible for the basic amount of the banknote.
The current interbank interest rate on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate exceeded the level of 18 September: it currently stands at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the summer money market crisis, the Bank of England has calculated a significant penalty interest on the amounts pumped into the money market, which has recouped banks from using them.
According to the speech (which only strengthens the exchange rate of the pound against the euro) many people would have been more satisfied with the resources offered by the European Central Bank, for which they could have been able to access it with a more favourable interest rate and a greater discretion.
UMP and NC are not willing to examine the Socialist proposal on purchasing power.
On Thursday, the UMP and the Nouveau Centre group blocked the discussion of articles of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to the rejection of the text itself.
The text discussed at the meeting initiated by the Socialists contained about ten measures, which were adopted on Tuesday by the National Office of the Socialist Party. These included, for example, a 50% increase in the employment allowance and a 50% increase in wages, a change in wages, a change in wages
As the UMP and the NC 180:115 voted against the review of the articles, the discussion between the government party and the opposition, sometimes in sharp voice, was eventually interrupted. This was only a few hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy was contacted by a teleprompter.
The head of the Socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would resubmit all its proposals as part of the amendment to the amending financial bill, which will be on the agenda of the National Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
A number of speeches have been made about the new Philadelphia music festival organized by C3 Presents. However, now the event organizer and popularizing company has announced that Melvin Benn, in cooperation with Festival Republic, will be held in Vineland, New Jersey.
“It’s an honor for us to be able to work with people who are the initiators of today’s American festival movement,” Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 is organized by Chicago’s Lollapalooza Festival and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The Vineland Festival in New Jersey will be held in the summer, so there will be a way to camp.
Between August 8 and 10, the festival will be held on a 500-moon private space, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Director of the Festival Republic, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Melvin Benn is one of the world’s most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he started organizing the British Reading Festival, which attracts around 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn further expanded his range with the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the Festival Republic launched the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival’s production, licensing and organizing tasks. The festival can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
C3’s colleague Charlie Jones called the Glastonbury Festival the “most inspiring event” he’s ever attended. He added that his company and Melvin Benn are working together to make the region a European-style festival event.
“We’ve chosen the Philadelphia venue before, and we’ve worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to organize this festival in the center of Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
"We continued to negotiate with the city and the Commission showed great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, however, due to the political manoeuvring of the city administration, the organization failed,” continued Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to talk about this with Melvin Benn, and we are now preparing to host a huge festival in another, unique location that will ultimately serve the interests of the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents was revived in 2005 by the Lollapalooza Festival in Grant Park, Chicago, after proving its exceptional talent as a festival organizer at the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The gross revenue of the two events in 2007 was $9.8 million, or $11.3 million.
Both festivals were held at the city’s venues.
“The European concept of Melvin Benn is built on the rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way, creating both the European rural atmosphere and the urban life that is common in America.”
Vineland is located roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“Vineland’s people, even the mayor himself, are excited to support the event,” says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not talk about the details of the agreement, he says that "the conditions are favorable enough to allow investment in such an event in a place that hopefully will give the festival a long time to go home".
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be of "horrible size" and its reception capacity will be roughly equal to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, with a capacity of 80,000 people.
The bands have already received the invitation to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
“Vineland will be basically a rock festival, but we’re planning a variety of music offerings so that everyone can find their favorite in it,” says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, form the C3 company, which received the "Best Independent Organiser" award at the latest Billboard Touring Awards.
Montreal is facing the Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to deal with the Terminator yourself...
The "treason" is one of Montreal's remittances.
The mission promises to be "politically difficult" as California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, opposes his own productions overseas.
Is it really difficult to take up the fight with the Terminator Governor?
“We have to be careful because the film industry decides for itself which is the best place.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you'll go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions, based on what they decide next to us,” Schwarzenegger says.
Competition for the Festivals
However, Denis Turcotte is now mainly focused on popularizing Canadian films.
The competition for the Oscars has begun.
The goal is to introduce and popularize as many Quebec films as possible at all American film festivals, be it the Sundance Film Festival, as well as the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival. You also need to strive for the directors to hold auditions.
The film L'<0xC3><0x82>ge des tén<0xC3><0xA8>bres received a favourable reception a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
The festival will also be held at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
The film Shake Hands with the Devil will be released in Santa Monica and will be screened at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
In addition, Quebec represented itself with four short films and four feature films this month at the American Film Institute Festival.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts share the opinion of the "subprime" crisis
Just five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are already rubbing their sleeves and are hardly expecting the end of the normal year.
This year, however, it is not clear to experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, "statistically, in December, the stock market generally behaves positively.
However, the forecasts with a purely statistical background are not necessarily correct, in fact, in the current situation, uncertainty characterizes the market, at least in the short term.”
Experts have earlier argued that the stock market will close at the end of the year, although it is stated that "the stock market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, this gives an opportunity to invest, since there are no alternatives to the guarantee, especially to the fixed income, which is not the reason why
For this reason, they believe that the stock market will be characterised by a more side-by-side, non-volatility-free movement, “mainly because the effect of the Fed’s fall in margins is not yet known, the price of crude oil is also high and the threat of inflationary tension.”
Javier Barrio, BPI’s sales manager in Spain, agrees with this, which means that it would be risky to declare a rally.
According to the expert, "the situation is not at all rosy."
Ibex’s loss is close to 4 percent compared to the highest values recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Despite all this, not all experts are so disruptive.
According to Intermoney analyst Juan Solana, the Ibex 35 can close the year to 16,000 points due to the reorganization of the wallets, as well as the payments made to the usual pension fund.
Otherwise, the expert adds that some changes can be expected this year, as the rally is postponed to the week after the long weekend of the second week of December, which affects the Feast of the Constitution.
The analyst considers that volatility is unlikely to affect market trends, according to the report.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, said: “We are close to the technical level and we can therefore experience a decline in the stock index, which may also increase depending on the news coming from the US, regarding the consequences of the credit market crisis.”
The analyst is confident that these will be favorable.
The analysts agree on what will be the securities aimed at achieving the new maximum quotas of Ibex.
Solana, from Intermoney, emphasizes that "I think there's a line on the big securities."
The expert added the two big banks and some construction companies to the list, “because the electricity sector is going to be very expensive.”
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco says the increase is due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
For construction companies, the rally can also be positive, of course, if at all.
"The ACS has been trying to regain its positions for months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow suit," he said.
The cyclical consumption will be the main factor for the remainder of the year due to the increase in sales that can be experienced during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technological companies can also do well, although in this area the representation in the Spanish market is not too high.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December’s exchange rate has only occurred twice.
The real year-end rally was observed in 2003 when the stock markets jumped out of the crisis caused by the bursting of the technological bubble.
In the same year, when Ibex 35 corrected 28.17 percent, a jump of 6.68% was recorded in December.
So it is still open whether 2007 will be the fifth profitable year after each other (currently Ibex is showing an 8.36% increase since January) and whether the final rally can take place.
Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol opens an account open from Monday to Saturday for 12 hours
Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol has decided to renew most of its accounts.
This affects a total of 200 accounts in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
The aforementioned accounts run under the name Popular Max and make a big change for the bank.
But also for other Spanish institutions, as this is the first group whose accounts are kept open continuously until 20.30 p.m. or even on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly called for its accounts to be extended, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
However, it is currently being agreed with trade unions that 75% of its accounts would be closed to open in exchange for one afternoon, although not for the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol will be crucial for other institutions, as they will decide on whether to join an initiative to support the more favourable opening of businesses.
This is the aim of the Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol project.
I would like to target private individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs, and local businesses in these places.
The bank wants to operate 200 accounts across Spain for 18 months with the aforementioned opening hours, because it is not about a new opening order, but about the transformation of the existing one.
To do this, the institution modernises its accounts located in commercial areas according to the needs of the customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening time is accompanied by a new kind of thinking of the character of the accounts, a more modern, colorful design.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, the head of commercial banks, points out that there is no need for large investments to reorganize, but more employees have to be employed, which means eight or nine employees per account instead of the current six.
The accounts, in which even the negotiators for SMEs will have a place, will also be able to sell non-financial products.
Beneficial Experiences
The initiative has already been implemented in the three Madrid accounts of Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol.
According to Angel Rivero, the experiences were favorable.
The election was held in the streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a in Madrid, and Rivero said the decision was correct.
Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol currently has 2,500 accounts.
Another 60 operate under the name Mundocredit, specializing in immigrants, and also has a very favorable opening order, even on Sundays and public holidays.
In the aforementioned PopularMax units, the BBVA model is not used, where some accounts offer a wide range of non-financial products.
“We don’t want to create competition for our customers,” Rivero says.
At the moment, they have managed to reach an agreement with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica and will use external staff to sell mobile phones.
Telecinco doubles its rival, Antena 3’s stock market value for the first time
"We did it."
With this statement, he expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the market yesterday with Paolo Vasile, Telecinco’s commissioned advisor, when it was revealed that his TV presenter had doubled the value of the Antena 3.
“It’s just the pain that it’s not because we’ve been up more, but because we’ve been up less tonight,” he said.
Even so, he put great emphasis on the fact that in the weak market we are “less at night”.
Telecinco closed yesterday with a 2.54 percent increase.
This increase puts the annual loss at 15.66 percent.
52 percent of the company is Mediaset, 13 percent is Vocento, so its stock value is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg.
Rivalry, the Antenna 3 lost 1.52 percent yesterday and has been able to account for a 40.5 percent drop since January, bringing it to 2,193.46 million yesterday.
The value of the other listed communication companies is 3,571 million for Sogecable; 2,518.53 million for Prisa (the publisher of Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1,779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 can be compared to the similarity between the two companies.
The question is just how much we can accomplish in the same market, what costs, and how it all turns out in terms of perspective.
Telecinco announced last week that it wants to be the first TV channel to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenue this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, a consultant for Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the latter of the group’s advertising subsidiary.
If the reported fact is realized, the revenue of the TV channel would increase by 3.6 per cent from advertising in the financial year 2006 compared to 965,4 million in the financial year 2006.
The net sales of the Antenna 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the financial year (it reached 734.4 million), while the net sales of television increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
According to analysts, one of the factors that triggered Telecinco’s stock market momentum was the high pay out held to date: in 2006, Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a distributed 100% of the company’s revenue among its shareholders.
According to Vasile, although it would be too early to decide, this rate could change after Endemol took 33% of its shares with its parent company, Mediasett.
“We officially guarantee a minimum 50% payout, although we’ve always distributed a lot more.
I hope that this year our shareholders will be pleased with us, as we have already favored them with the acquisition of 33 percent of Endemol.”
According to analysts, the market is currently characterised by some stagnation.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its sales estimates for Telecinco by 4 percent in 2008 and 7 percent in 2009.
According to them, this is due to the fact that the estimated increase in price revenue in 2008 is down from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
According to the same company’s forecasts, Antena 3’s earnings fell by 4.5 percent in 2008 and by 7.5 percent in 2009.

1.
Ibersecurities: it recommends the purchase of both securities, mainly because of its high profitability and long-term sustainable potential from the division.
2.
Caja Madrid: sees Telecinco as more favorable (buying) than the Antena 3 (maintenance) due to its "multiple attraction" and business strengthening.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, it recommends underweighting due to "similar risks" (charged market and a more unfavorable economic climate).
Congress approves takeover of MiFID, which came into effect on November 1
In parallel with the parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the Congressional vote approving amendments to the Senate, the government initiated a social dialogue on the rule of law so that both can come into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups unanimously highlighted the efforts made by the representatives and senators in the negotiations and agreements, which are aimed at establishing the most favourable normative framework for the protection of investors, as well as the detailed regulation of the activities of the companies.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, allows the modernisation of the money markets, at the same time strengthens the protection of investors, expands the powers of the Supervisory Union of the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV).
The new Directive makes it possible to provide financial advisory services to companies that are specialized in this field, but also to natural or legal persons, as well as to companies that sell securities, to securities agencies and to companies that are responsible for portfolio management.
In addition, the law will increase the number of systems suitable for the implementation of operations affecting funds, so as to add to the regulated secondary markets the internalisation systems of multilateral trading platforms and the internalisation systems which carry out the performance of the contracts, i.e.
In addition, the Act obliges investment providers to provide market information on the specific aspects of their business profile, their risk commitment and methods of risk management, as well as to facilitate the control of the CNMV, in order to carry out all registrations.
The Economic Committee of the Congress has tabled a number of amendments. Of these, it is of outstanding importance that securities debts are treated as a "complex" means, but because of the high risk to the investor. This is a high risk to the U.S. investor.
On the other hand, the transposition of the Directive has also been used to legally circumvent the scope of the activities of those with economic and business responsibilities, 30 years after the entry into force of the Directive in 1977 only by the competent authorities.
The Senate has proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as the broker agent, who works on a different account, does not need the permission of the CNMV, and can simultaneously sell products or acquire clients for multiple investment firms.
The Consumer Index increased by 0.5 points in November, reaching 4.1%.
This figure, taken into account by Eurostat to calculate the inflation rate of the European Union, shows the growth of Spanish prices for the month of November.
It is in line with the strategy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank to provide data that can be compared with data from the United States, both in terms of their origin and their nature.
The same calculation method is used for the preliminary indicator number as for the calculation of the Unified Index, but the statistical modelling method differs from the estimation of information that is not yet available at the time of making it public.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the preliminary indicator number is purely informative and may therefore differ from the final data, which will be made public on 14 December.
"The Consumer Index continues to show relatively high value."
Pedro Solbes, one of the vice presidents of the government and the Minister of Economy, said that the increase in the Consumer Index to 4.1% in November was only "temporary", but also indicated in advance that the price index is expected to be "relatively high".
Solbes confirmed in Parliament’s corridors that “although the indicator number is not really favorable”, Spain’s inflation rate has remained at more or less the same level within the monetary union in recent years.
He added that the month of November brought "less surprises" than the previous month, when the government did not count on such a large increase.
"We were expecting a value of around 4%," the Minister of Economic Affairs said, referring to the data made public during the day.
Northern Rock is aiming to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion over the next three years.
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% and currently only <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 billion 800 million) have been made since the crisis in mid-September and had to take out an emergency loan from the National Bank of England.
It also had a record-breaking deposit of over <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, the number of which has gradually decreased over the past two and a half months due to the loss of confidence of customers, despite the government promising a one hundred percent guarantee to the bank until the end of the crisis.
Under Virgin’s own financial, commercial name, Virgin Money will operate this unit. Virgin needs to earn about a quarter of the British bank’s revenue over the next three years to achieve the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion in revenue, and this will reach the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion target.
Richard Branson’s group of highly regarded businessmen, known for its high-profile advertising campaigns in England, is planning to spend around <0xC2><0xA3>50 million a year (i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) on advertising and marketing in order to reach the desired goal.
Northern Rock raised the Virgin consortium’s offer this week as the most favorable way to avoid a failure. In addition to Virgin, three other companies form the consortium.
The mayor of Totana has been arrested on a suspected corruption case.
The police arrested the mayor of Totana, a town in the province of Murcia, this morning, on suspicion of being involved in a city corruption scandal that broke out this week.
In addition, one of the city hall’s secretaries and the police chief of the village were arrested.
In May, José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, a member of the city’s representative body, replaced Juan Morales, who was the head of the corruption network, according to the official bodies interviewed by the SER radio channel.
The police continue to investigate in the city’s offices, as well as at the City Development Council, and it cannot be ruled out that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales’ lawyer was also investigated as the main suspect in the corruption scandal that erupted this week.
According to the SER radio station, Juan Morales' lawyer was arrested when he was just leaving Morales with corruption-related documentation in his pocket.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged reward that Morales received in return for signing a city development agreement with a Galician construction company to reconfirm 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepts the nomination of the PSOE in Toledo and the office of the President of Parliament if they win the elections.
The former defence minister, José Bono, accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and also the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE’s list of candidates in the next parliamentary elections and to fill in the answers of the President’s office as often as possible.
This was announced by the Secretary of the PSOE Organization, José Blanci, at a press conference, and Bono himself confirmed this after a meeting with Zapater in the southern center of the party.
The Prime Minister has justified his election to the former prime minister by saying that “we have to count on the best” in politics and that “Bono is among the best”.
In addition, he added that "probably" the Manchai politician will be the Socialist Party's candidate for the office of President of Parliament if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would take over the seat of the current President of Parliament, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, who announced on November 15 that he was not planning to run in the next election and gave up his political career, instead fighting climate change in scientific circles.
The former prime minister acknowledged that the prime minister has been constantly ostracizing to return to the political scene since he left active politics two years ago.
He added that since voters are aware of who the vice president of the economy will be in the event of the socialists' victory, the party would also like to inform them of who will be the president of the parliament.
If Bono is really going to fill the post, he would like Parliament to be "in the realm of respect and not in the realm of insults or screaming" and to be more like the home of citizens.
“Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to talk calmly, it has already happened that the Prime Minister’s speech has been interrupted 26 times in the Senate,” he said.
At the same time, he praised the current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, for his "excellent work", but did not want to present himself as already president, so that his opponents would not be considered "supervised".
A Campaign for Climate Change
Since the climate change-advertising movement is relentlessly pursuing both those who are skeptical about their predictions, and those who take advantage of political or social struggles, it must be very strong.
Even a political leader like Prime Minister Zapatero, who says the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and proclaims that “we need to make a new agreement with our Earth.”
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its government has contributed to the fact that Spain is living within the Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Convention.
Who is responsible for not adhering to the Convention, which sector is affected, and why has the Government not sought to avoid this?
In addition, it should clearly explain to the Spanish what measures they intend to take in order to prevent climate change.
What companies will be affected by these measures, what habits do people have to change, what level of energy savings should we expect at individual and social levels, and what economic consequences will this have?
So who needs to make a sacrifice and who needs to pay to save our Earth?
But we have not received and we will not receive an explanation for these questions.
Exactly because it's about sacrifice and money.
“Climate change has taken measures, and actual measures have always been unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable, and expensive for both companies and the population.
Even PSOE’s gasoline buildup would have been so unpopular before the elections that Zapatero quickly withdrew.
That is, we must save the Earth from nothing, merely propaganda texts, empty, actual consequences-free passwords.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new offices.
The agreement with the Earth, as the head of government says, which speaks so beautifully in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack or even embellish the election meetings and awakens weakness in us.

Totana's mayor and chief of police have been arrested over an alleged corruption case.
The police arrested the mayor of the town of Totana in the province of Murcai, José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreot of the People's Party, the local Chief of Police, the secretary of the Town Hall and a hospitality entrepreneur, accused of being involved in urban development.
The mayor was arrested in his home and then transferred to the City Hall, where he is currently staying with several police officers, many of whom are in charge of the City Development Council and the municipal bodies entrusted with the management of the Departments and Housing.
The three arrests were preceded by the arrests of six people in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia last Monday in connection with a case in which they were reassigned to a land for the construction of 2 hectares of farmland to allow them to occupy 4 hectares of land.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation, according to the information provided by the Court of Totana No. 1.
The first six persons arrested were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, Totana’s former mayor Juan Morales, who is now an independent MP for the People’s Party, is also under investigation.
The ex-wife, who owns a property agency registered in Totana, is also being investigated, as is her current girlfriend of the former mayor, who lives in the provincial center of Murcia.
The Nuaria Group’s director and owner, Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigra (Pontevedra), together with the director of the company Suelo de Inmonuar, Pablo José M.G., and the latter company is affiliated with the Nuaria Group.
The investigation is carried out by a group of the Central Operational Unit of the Police (Cend<0xC5><0x91>ranek) responsible for crimes committed at the Government level, whose members held eleven house searches in addition to the arrests, mainly in connection with the detainees in Madrid, in Madrid, in companies in Madrid, in Madrid, in Madrid, and in Vicarious persons.
One person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a company dealing with well-known baroque products in the area, who could have played a mediating role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in Totana, with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company acquired an area of 2.2 million square meters in Totana, which has been reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the current 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, Vigo, Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela, and the parking lot of the Catholic Ferdinand Square, Conycase, the direct marketing agency of Pregar and its commercial premises.

If they agree, we'll miss the Book of the Moon a little bit, and we'll see if we can harness some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I've already equipped it with one.

Our Finnish journalist found this comment in one of Finland’s largest journals: (probably at the top of the PISA report on the world’s artistic level), in the Sanomat of Helsinki, referring to what appeared on November 18, at the same time as the criticism of Blackburn’s book.
"The philosophical teachings came to the public after the tragedy of Jokela High School.
In the messages of a student standing before an adult, the killer quoted the writings of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the Education Councillor in charge of teaching philosophy, asked the Helsinki Sanomat daily to examine Plato’s teachings with a critical eye and then added that Nietzsche’s knowledge is not necessarily important for compulsory primary school education.

One of his colleagues informs us that the Criminal Code contains a crime related to Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song is considered a crime and can be punished from six months to a year.
However, if you steal a record worth less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 in a store, it is only a violation of the rules (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal 1000 euros in a store, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty still does not reach the amount of penalty to be imposed in case of an online download (Article 234 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).
C. If you steal a car but return it within 40 hours, the penalty still does not reach the amount of penalty to be imposed in case of internet download (244.1 articles).
D. You can expect a smaller penalty if you mix into battle than if you copy CDs.
If you take part in a mass shooting, you may receive a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the CTBT), but a penalty of six months to two years for copying the CD.
(BTK Article 270).
E. According to article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD movie.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright shall be punishable more severely without the consent of the authors than the sale of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague's right, someone's got a lot of stuff out of hand.

I received an article from my GP about strange research with the following title: "Money causes brain activity, especially if the others have less of it."
That is, the feelings of the workers on the pay day depend on how much the others got.
The experiment was carried out at the University of Bonn by measuring magnetic resonance tomography, and the results were also published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and the head of the Neurocognition Group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, “We measured the strongest activity when the participant responded correctly, but the partner was wrong.”
The researchers found that if both were given the right answer and received the same monetary reward, the brain activity was moderated, but if one of them received a double amount, the activity also increased.
I have no idea why it took so much science to come to such a simple conclusion.
The Attorney General of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been mercilessly prosecuting Balkan war criminals in The Hague for eight years, and from the Criminal Court’s Office of Criminal Investigation investigating crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.
The mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a bit of a sore throat, as those responsible for the Srebrenica massacre, during which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were massacred, namely General Ratko Mladic and Serbian Bosnian leader Radov<0xC3><0xA1>n Karadzsic are still at large.
Their name is on the list chosen by the Swiss director Marcel Sch<0xC3><0xBC>pbach on the title of his documentary: Carla's List (2006, Spain not yet shown). The film follows the work of the Swiss attorney general Belg<0xC3><0xA1>d Belg<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1> from his childhood in New York, similar to real crime.
What kind of insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which means the safety of the owner of the car, brings a significant expense against various damages and also depends on several factors, such as the age, no, the date of obtaining the license, the family status and the insured car owner.
Buying a car is just the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car you want.
First of all, we need to be aware of what this is all about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured person.
This Agreement shall consist of a body in the form of an insurance contract which states that the insurance company undertakes compensation in the case of the occurrence of an accident at the head of the fixed insurance premium.
The insurance fee is basically the amount paid for the insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors, such as the age, no, the date of obtaining the licence, the family status, the type of car to be insured, its use, and so on.
The insurance companies shall determine the insurance premium on the basis of the statistics, i.e. they shall pay a higher amount which represents a higher accident risk.
That’s why women over the age of 25 pay less, or pay less, because according to statistics, they pose a lower risk because they are more cautious.
Similarly, on the basis of the evidence, insurance companies have come to the conclusion that even those living in marriage cause fewer accidents than those who are single.
When using a car, the frequency is decisive.
With more frequent use, the possibility of an accident increases.
When determining the insurance premium, a number of factors are taken into account by the insurance companies.
Therefore, the owner should look closely at it in order to choose the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
In the following, we will show you the most important factors in the choice, so that you can best adapt to the needs of the insured and create an acceptable price.
When concluding an insurance contract, under 25 years of age must be accounted for by a number of disadvantages, such as lack of driving experience and the freshness of the licence.
Although the most legitimate, if we are assured against all dangers, there are also more economical solutions.
More cautious drivers can commit to full self-insurance, thereby being secured against any danger, and the price will also be affordable.
In this type of contract, the insured pays a portion of the damage.
“The amount of self-insurance to be paid by the insured depends on the insurance premium; the higher the premium, the lower the self-insurance,” says Luis Noguera, the head of First Europe, Spain’s internet insurance broker.
Another option is extended liability insurance to third parties, when the customer provides himself against the damage caused to others, but not against the damage caused in his own car.
In addition, you will be assured against theft, fire damage and the loss of the car.
That's good advice.
If you are not yet 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will have an effect on the bonus and thus you can reduce the amounts to be paid in the future.
A bonus is called a discount in comparison with the basic price of the insurance company.
And we call the penalty imposed in relation to the basic tariff a falsification.
"The amount of the bonus and the bonus depends on the insurance company and the winnings.
If the company has had a good year, you can afford to raise the bonus amount,” explains Noguera.
If the age of 25 has already passed, it is easier for owners to provide adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced thanks to the experience gained over the years.
Then we advise you to take full insurance with your own hands.
"In general, young people are not yet able to properly apply their experience in one or another accident, not even when driving," says the director of the European insurance company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of driving when they reach the end of the road.
If the insured person is already married, but does not yet have children, it is best to have complete insurance, of course, if the financial options allow this.
Insurance companies consider child marriages to be the lowest risk for clients, so in their case, the fee to be paid is also lower.
In this case, it is best to have complete insurance with self-insurance (this can reach 300 euros) or if you have a higher bonus, the insurance can be extended from the third year of the vehicle to the damage caused to the other.
“They drive more comfortably, but at the same time they have more customers, and they can afford to have higher self-esteem,” says Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, we recommend full insurance with self-disclosure (which is around 150 euros) or in the case of a higher bonus can also be extended for liability insurance.
Car insurance is very important, not only because it means protection for the owner in the event of damage, but also because it means a big expense, so it is essential to choose the form of insurance that is tailored to the individual.
He wants to get Celtic points in Milan to get into the eighth inning.
Milan and Celtic on Tuesday measured their strength at the San Siro Stadium to score the missing point at the close of the Champions League. The Italians can be the first with this and the Scots can qualify themselves.
The Italians have a total of ten points and in the fifth round they have secured the transfer with a draw against Portugal, but Celtic has nine points, but one more is needed for the six-point Shakhtar, who will fight with the four-point Benfica, not to advance.
The two matches of Group D will be held one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan will have to play in Japan at the Club World Cup, where on the 13th in the preliminary round he will try to avoid the transfer to the 16th final.
With this, Group D closes earlier than the others, and although the most likely result at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be the indecisive, the two teams are striving for victory, as the Italians do not want to stay at home, and Celtic are the first to start from a better place.
Even Gordon Strachan's team will have enough defeat to qualify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but can't be sure because if there's a score, the Ukrainians will get on with losing last week in Glasgow (2-1) but won the next round (2-0).
The Italians will try to make the night worse for the Scots, who would like to get into the 8th round of the reorganised Champions League twice after having scored a goal from the Kak<0xC3><0xA1> in the last season.
Shakhtar could be most happy about the victory of the "Rossonerik" because if he loses Celtic he will enter the eighth round and remain in UEFA.
Since Benfica is currently in last place and unlikely to remain in the European Championship, they can still get third place with a win that they can play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to take part in the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
Spice Girls began their tour in Vancouver, Canada, with 20,000 spectators performing for the first time since they split up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) are just a few minutes away from the concert at GM Place in Vancouver.
About 20,000 people exchanged tickets to be there at the concert, which also featured a video film about a huge success in the history of the band in the 1990s.
With the regrouping of the band and the tour, EMI also released a new album in Spain, featuring the bigger hits and two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five members of the Spice Girls have taken the stage in a tie-up from their husband, David Beckham, from "Posh Spice."
The athlete was also there in the crowded viewing area of GM Place, although a few days earlier Victoria banned him.
Victoria Beckham said in a statement that the British football star had “never seen her acting clothes before, so I’m nervous about what she’ll think of the performance.”
'Sporty Spice', was the reason the band split up two years after he left the band in 1998 "because the members didn't understand each other". He also seemed nervous during the press briefing, which was held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was upset, but I saw that the people's feelings for the Spice Girls have changed.
I thought why not? Now I’m happy that I’ve decided to do so,” Chisholm said of the band, which he split up nine years earlier.
The singer added that over time, “things are arranged and we love each other very much.”
But a lot of things have changed since the last time the Spice Girls came out in 1998.
CTV TV reported that Virgin Airlines had arrived in Vancouver on its special aircraft.
A group of babysitters were waiting for them at the airport.
All five of them have seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the team will perform in California (USA), then in San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7).
The event will take place in Madrid on 23 December.
Further fears about the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
The gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia has been renewed, which could also affect Russian fuel to be transported to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is being passed through Ukraine and the discussions between the two countries are always paying great attention.
Kiev said that if Moscow raises the gas price paid by the Ukrainians, they will also hit Russia at a higher cost of transit.
As a result of an earlier dispute between the two countries last year, the supply to the EU countries decreased.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow between the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, concerns the attempt to reach an agreement on the level of gas to be paid to Russia by Ukraine in 2008.
Gazprom said it would have to carry out a 50% increase compared to the price agreement concluded with Ukraine in respect of gas produced from neighbouring Turkmenistan in 2008.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of shipments from Gazprom to Ukraine.
"It is important to argue in accordance with one of the most important transit countries in the negotiations," Ukraine's economic minister, Anatoly Kinah, told Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas pipelines should in any case be linked to our ongoing debate on the extent of the costs of transit (and transit to Western Europe) in Ukraine."
As a result of the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas pipeline leading to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has resulted in a domino-like decline in exports to Western Europe, which has also pushed up prices to a large extent.
A quarter of the European Union’s gas supply is made up of Russian gas.
Russia has the world’s largest natural gas reserves, but most of them are still unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Central Asian Soviet states with natural gas.
The NHS “is obliged to check foreign workers”
Scotland’s NHS committees need to improve control of the criminal record of workers coming from outside Europe, a supervisory body said in a statement.
The proposal was made by Chief Accountant Robert Black after a doctor of foreign nationality in Scotland was linked to an attack on the Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of overseas workers in the UK.
At the same time, the report, through the example of five health authorities, also pointed to key controls that were properly carried out.
Following the attack on the Glasgow airport, the main contractor checked the list of employees who had been recruited outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
The 28-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor from the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep dragged him to the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of the three doctors who were interviewed by the Old Bailey Court by videotape in October on charges of car bombings in the United Kingdom.
In the case of its employees from overseas countries, the NHS committees shall, before commencing employment, verify the existence and experience of the employees concerned, as well as the necessary authorisation to work in the United Kingdom.
Although Disclosure Scotland is used by the Scottish Health Committees for the purpose of verifying the criminal record, the Agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside the territory of the United Kingdom.
The main contractor’s report proposed, among other things, that the Commissions should introduce a Guide to the Office for the Registration of Crime, which will make it easier for the employer to carry out checks with the various overseas countries.
"Although we found evidence of such checks among the records of the staff, they are not regularly carried out," the report said.
According to Black, the NHS of Scotland performs its own pre-employment review procedure at a high level, adding: "Our report highlights the development areas of the system so that we have up-to-date information on the existence of its staff from across the NHS."
According to Dr Peter Terry, the president of BMA Scotland, it is "extremely unlikely" that we could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future through pre-employment checks.
"According to the report, pre-employment checks are working well in NHS Scotland, and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent," he added.
According to the Scottish health authorities, the majority of their overseas employees, consisting of doctors and nurses, currently number 1161.
However, the main contractor drew attention to the fact that the figures are likely to be higher, which can be explained in part by the fact that the identification of employees on indefinite leave is a problem for the committees.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures introduced in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and in the NHS authorities in Lothian are in a high degree consistent.
These procedures have been extended to check the passport, the work permit, as well as the documents certifying the qualifications.
The Scottish Government is also currently examining the guidelines and guidelines for pre-employment checks on employees from non-NHS overseas countries.
Nicola Sturgeon, Secretary of Health, said: "It was a great pleasure to have been able to carry out this task after the attack on Glasgow Airport.
He also added that the Scottish Government - in cooperation with the Health Committees - will take into account the proposals contained in the report and will ensure that all employees - including those coming from overseas - are on a regular basis, in order to prevent them from becoming employed.
The Joy Division is at the Film Awards
A biopic about Joy Division's late singer Ian Curtis, "Control", won five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including the Best Film Award.
The main character, Sam Riley, worked in a warehouse before Curtis was formed, as well as Anton Corbijn, director, and Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench won the Best Actress award with the thriller "Details of a Tragedy".
The Variety Award was presented by British filmmaker Daniel Craig, who created Bond, for putting the British film in international spotlight.
The awards were presented as part of a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
The film "Control" depicts Curtis' rise within the ranks of the Joy Division until 1980, when, at the age of 23, he committed suicide.
"The Killers", "David Bowie" and "New Order on the Soundtrack" were only <0xC2><0xA3>3 million in black and white films.
The Dutch photographer, Corbijn - who was previously known for his work on the album cover of U2's "Joshua Tree" - still won two awards; the best director and the best novice director award.
Another winner of the celebration put rock music in the spotlight; his film about Julien Temple Joe Strummer, the singer of Clash, won the best documentary award.
The Best Actor Award for Best Actor was given to Viggo Mortensen for his portrayal of David Cronenberg as the London-based thriller "The Deadly Promises" as a mafia driver.
Ray Winstone, known for his hard-boy roles, was awarded the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The 50-year-old actor, whose names include "Scum", "Ehkoppon" and "Sexy Ass", is currently taking part in the filming of "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone is proud to receive the "Camelot" and "Harry Potter" award for his star, Harris, who passed away in 2002.
“For people like me, people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened a door,” Winstone said.
"I'm really lucky to have met Richard Harris several times.
Richard Harris’s style is close to me, he was a great actor of his age, and I really appreciate him.”
A group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers has decided to select independent film awards known as Bifa.
Bifa’s sponsors and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
In Saudi Arabia, 208 people have been arrested in connection with a terrorist plot.
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that 208 militants, who were involved in terrorist cells, had been arrested, planned to carry out an attack on an oil facility, as well as more church personnel and security forces.
According to the state television of the world's largest oil exporter, one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles.
Supporters of al-Qaida launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been acting as an ally of the United States since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
According to a television report, eight main cells led by a foreign citizen will launch an attack against an oil refinery in the eastern province.
Following a 2006 attack attempt by Al-Qaeda against the world’s largest oil refinery in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia began building a 35,000-strong fast-response force to protect facilities.
According to a report cited by the Interior Minister, 18 of the detainees belong to a cell led by a "person specializing in missile shootings" who illegally crosses the country's border.
The report also reported that the fighters were trying to smuggle eight bullets into the territory of the kingdom.
Twenty-two of them were detained and plans were drawn up to carry out assassinations against church leaders and security forces.
The government has called for tougher action by church leaders to stop Saudis joining al-Qaida fighters in Iraq, who are fighting the allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shiites against the Muslim government.
Al-Qaida fighters are seen as a significant part of Saudi church leaders who have been implicated by the authorities in support of the government’s royal family policy.
The organization’s fighters — fueled by the call by al-Qaeda’s Saudi-born leader Osama bin Laden to target the Saudi-friendly government — set off attacks on foreign settlements, government buildings, and energy industries.
“The security forces have made huge efforts in the last ... five months,” a ministry spokesman told state television, according to Reuters.
During the arrests, a 16-person "media cell" was also captured in Medina, the purpose of which was to spread the "takfiri thought". Takfiri thinking is an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which is opposed to the infidels and the infidels.
The arrests also included 32 people who were charged with financial support from the militants.
The climate of Venus could provide a glimpse into the future of the Earth
According to the scientists yesterday, Venus was once able to provide a pleasant living environment.
The data from a European orbiting spacecraft suggest that this planet is much more likely to be considered the Earth’s twin brother than we previously believed.
Venus is the closest neighbor to the planet Earth.
The size of the two planets is almost the same and their orbits are similar, although Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now know that, billions of years ago, Venus could have had very similar living conditions to Earth, and even the habitable conditions could have been given.
However, due to the high carbon dioxide greenhouse potential, atmospheric erosion caused by solar radiation, and the lower rotational speed of the planet, Venus has entered a different course of development in the sea.
Today, the water has evaporated from the planet, the surface temperature is hot enough to dissolve the lead, and hurricane-force winds and lightning storms are destroyed.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft - based on a one-year study of the planet - provide a compelling picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes can occur on Earth as well.
Fred Taylor, a professor at the University of Oxford’s Department of Physics, who is one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “Begin to guess why the Venusian climate is so vastly different from being on the edge of the Earth, to being on the edge of a rainbow.
“With our new data, it was possible to develop a script about the formation of Venus billions of years ago, when it could still have habitable conditions similar to Earth.
Police arrested for "extended uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material - enriched uranium, according to reports - was seized yesterday by the Slovaks and the Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesman, three people were arrested and the matter was also being investigated.
The speaker did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but stated that the material could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).

Mitt Romney says it’s not worth it for a candidate running for president to answer questions from a snowman.
The Republican candidates for the presidential election, however, agreed to participate in a debate broadcast on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and forwarded them to the candidates.
None of the questions released on Wednesday evening turned out to be as ridiculous as the snowman, who asked Democrats about global warming in his debate with the other party on YouTube.
This time, however, the questions and answers were a good reflection of the situation of the Republican party approaching next year’s election.
It is not yet known that CNN’s co-financed production executives have selected YouTube clips that were distributed to the candidates based on exactly what they were doing.
The longest question in the first half-hour of the debate was about immigration.
This topic is one of the Republican’s garbage dumps.
CNN has asked a number of unconvincing voters to discuss a number of things that, if anything to their dismay, are to be said: the mediator experienced a high consensus when the candidates made a tough statement about the border issue.
The longest-running and longest-running debate was between Rudy Giuliani at the national level, as well as Romney advancing in crucial pre-elections held in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the image of him, according to which he handled the issue of illegal immigration too easily during his civil service in New York City.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants from his former governor in Massachusetts to build his own house.
The wording between the two of them became particularly tense when the respondents were interested in the support of "amnesty" (which would provide illegal immigrants with the possibility of permanent status and citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes — such as California’s Duncan Hunter and Colorado’s Tom Tancredo — have been able to thoroughly delve into the topic.
And while none of them are likely to be nominated, their stay on the racetrack may be explained by the fact that they began to congregate the migratory noise earlier and louder than the others.
At least in the case of immigration, a broad consensus can be observed among the candidates: a common goal is to strengthen the borders, as well as a tough action against illegal immigrants.
This theme - like the fear of Chinese toxic games and other calming factors coming from the outside world - helps the Republicans within the ranks of the libertarians to become oblivious to, or at least to, the shared memory of, the libertarians and the Christian conservatives.
However, when other topics of a different nature came to the fore, the debate was very uncomfortable.
Giulianina had to deal with the question of why she had previously supported the arms control.
John McCain and Romney have come to the question of whether the simulated water intrusion should be considered torture.
Another questioner was asked if the candidates believed all the words of the Bible.
In this question, Giuliani finally stumbled upon the point of view that while his favorite book is the Bible, Jonah and the whale might not literally interpret the story.
A further question arose as to whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who won the first place in the Iowa election, who was able to win the election thanks to a steady Christian conservatism, responded to expectations that the death penalty was painful, but needed.
When asked whether Jesus would receive enough support, he laughed so much that he said that Jesus was wiser than he was going to run for office.
The competition is still unusually open.
Huckabee's thrilling rise in Iowa coincides with libertarian Ron Paul's fundraising campaign and Wednesday's debate with a thrilling thrill.
The sudden emergence of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that so far the two wings of the party have not managed to launch a joint candidate among the more well-known and traditional aspirants.
In 1980 and 2000 there was a candidate who united the party, who in time and convincingly suppressed the victory message announcing the greatness of America, and who found the common voice with both wings of the party.
Now, however, the party has been divided, and the consequences of this are yet to be seen.
Work-Party Pains
Previous Previous post: Gordon Brown’s Next Breakout Path Is Unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, the present does not seem too picky.
No one sold his honour, no politician was given his hotel bills in Paris, and no one committed an out-of-marriage scandal.
But his discovery that a wealthy businessman, under the name of others, for more than four years with a sum of more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million), had made a surprise contribution to the Labour Party, which ruled Great Britain, and that the party had not made a report about it, was one of the things that Mr. Brown was looking at.
Two months ago, when the prime minister canceled the election, and when he made his statement - that public opinion research did not influence the outcome of the decision - he questioned the British intellectual ability to question it, and the people were still afraid to ask him.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, noted with more and more intellectual remarks, the once-feared Brown Stalin was transformed into Mr. Bean.
A move to save a struggling bank called Northern Rock has put regulatory weaknesses and deficiencies in the judiciary in the crossfire.
Patient proposals for the amendment of the tax law have encouraged business interest groups to come together against the helmsman.
The loss of 25 million people’s personal data by the tax authorities has inconceivably exposed a large degree of administrative inaction.
Three retired generals in the House of Lords, who protested against a reduction in the army's budget, said the Minister of Defence's position was part-time.
And now here are David Abrahams' mysterious donations; Peter Watt, the Labour Party's secretary-general (previously an administrative leader) has already resigned.
These accidents do not yet mean that Brown could not return on the road to the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach the point where management is irreconcilable.
People don’t like politicians and don’t even trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their disbelief.
As soon as it becomes clear, however, that the Prime Minister is not likely to be able to postpone things, and perhaps not remain in his post for a long time, the end of the suspended infidelity: the army of public servants begins to sneeze, to sneeze, to sneeze, to sneeze
In a sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult situation, as unlike other political leaders, he does not count as "fresh blood."
No matter how much he wanted to deny his relationship with Tony Blair, he was still in his right hand.
The problems surrounding Northern Rock and tax records, for example, are related to decisions made during Brown’s administration of finance.
And while Blair’s kind of left-wing moves — such as the “money nobility” case and the escalating investigation of the relationship between political party funding — have not directly taken part, voters can rightly assume the opposite.
Even though Brown's situation is unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it seems.
The shots taken are not as scary as the ones that are shown in the trailers.
As with Mr. Bean, no one was killed, no one was taken directly.
And compensation, no matter how painful, can always lead to the direction that Stalin, who lives in Brown, has promised: a reliable, solid, and a little tough governance.
For example, it is a good idea to make a political donation.
The Garb<0xC3><0xB3>ian intellectual Abrahams, who compares his donation to charity, stated that he did not want to expose his goodness to the public.
Perhaps that is the case, but the decision did not fall under his control.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of big political supporters is clear and clear: the people have the right to know who knocks on the door of the country’s rulers.
Watt, who, according to his own account, knew of Abraham’s action, but was not aware of its illegal nature, will certainly be swept away in the hearings; as did Jon Medleson, the founding leader of the Workers’ Party, who spent the summer in October.
Brown, on the other hand, is not led by the wires: there is no indication that he knew about these schemes, not even that the payment of huge amounts was made after Brown entered office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has completed half of his duties.
Although he condemned the violation of the law committed by his party in a hurry, his firmness, however, made him a familiar instrument; by examining the case - for the sake of security - he entrusted himself with a retired bishop and a judge's chair.
In this story, the “learning lesson” is not too complicated.
In the event of a violation of the law, the police are responsible.
In addition, Brown must also take care of other matters, such as the appointment of the Chairman of the Independent Committee on Administrative Rules, which has been operating without a leader for six months, or the effective reform of political party funding.
This would require the hard-line Workers’ Party to cooperate with the Tori and sever special financial ties with the associations – this would be a tough wall for the party’s Brown.
But you should look at some of the facts about the party.
According to the polls, the Conservatives are currently leading with a serious advantage; Brown has two years to win back the voters behind him; the only way to achieve victory is through inexorable incompatibility and strong competition.
Card sharks
Is the secondary market mortgage-market crisis threatening the American credit card market?
When blood gets into the water, it is natural for sharks to appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is weakening, predators are focusing on the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that if the mortgage crisis also infects other forms of mortgages, the credit card market loss could reach as much as $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
The description rate of both the percentage of non-performing loans increased, and the rate of default indicating the percentage of late payments over 30 days.
HSBC reported a $1.4 billion loss last month in the U.S. consumer finance segment, partly due to the financial weakness of cardholders.
At the same time, the panic is still early.
The rate of late and late payments is still low.
Moody’s’s credit rating agency reported a 3.89% late payment rate for the third quarter at a full percentage point lower than the historical average.
The reduction in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
Amendments to the U.S. rules on individual insolvency in 2005 resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of applicants for insolvency, at the same time caused a large loss in the market of credit cards, due to the number of insolvencies (requests for bankruptcy)
The rate of payment, which shows the percentage of monthly credit losses of consumers, is also solid in the market.
In addition, the confidence in the securities covered by the credit card is also quite strong, despite the stagnation in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney at the TowerGroup research firm estimates that the 2007 release volume will be 25% higher than last year’s.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage market crisis on the credit card market are clear: consumers are increasing the debt on credit cards to eliminate residential properties.
At the same time, card issuers primarily pay attention to the movement of money and not the asset value, so the decline in housing prices does not necessarily lead to a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
For the borrowers, the situation may even be advantageous.
If the property is less than the value of the mortgage, the incentive for consumers to cancel the loan will decrease; as a result, the repayment of debts on the credit cards will advance in the priority ranking.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers are able to adapt more quickly and flexibly to changing conditions than those of mortgage lenders.
Theoretically, this should reduce the risk of a sudden re-exploitation of the devices.
“It’s unlikely that one day we’ll wake up to fully reassess the loans,” said Gary Perlin, chief financial officer of Capital One.
If a subprime-like sudden crisis in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual decline is much more likely to exist.
If the declining housing market prices and the downturn in lending are driving America into recession, the industry is looking to a grim future without a doubt.
It's worth keeping an eye on those predatory prey.
British bankers found themselves guilty of Enron's crime
On Wednesday, he pleaded guilty to the three British bankers who were tried by Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Faston, to investigate their role in the fraud.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded not guilty to the weekly fraud charge that they allegedly co-operated with Fastow in a secret fraud committed in 2000 that they wanted to do at the expense of their employer.
Their negotiations began in January of this year.
But at a court hearing, U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. admitted to all of them the crime he committed in an ordinary fraud.
Three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group’s Greenwich NatWest division have become known in the UK during the two-year issue procedure.
The closure of the investigation into the case initiated after the collapse of Enron in 2001 is still pending in the United States.
The first indictment against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of a government investigation into Enron's failure.
In 2000, three brokers, who had been named the "NatWest Three", allegedly traveled to Houston to prepare for the fraud together with Michael Kopper, who worked with Fastow and the then-right-hander of Fastow.
Fastow, who was responsible for designing numerous frauds that led to Enron’s failure, also held the Enron subsidiary under the control of Greenwich NatWest.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of its shareholding in the subsidiary, but the three British men were well aware that the interest rate was very high.
A company run by Kopper bought the bank’s $1 million stake in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to acquire a stake in this company.
According to the lawsuit, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would buy a $20 million stake in the subsidiary from Greenwich NatWest.
But in fact, $20 million was struck by the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The lawsuit claims that the bankers made 7.3 million while Fastow, Kopper and others made $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed to his two-pronged crime for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The three British men were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper spends three years and a month in a Texas prison.
The three English men were allowed to travel to the United States in the head of a $1 million shelter, where they stayed for a period of time.
Enron, the seventh-largest U.S. company ever to report bankruptcy in December 2001, after accounting tricks used for years could no longer save the millions accumulated as debt or the amount of income that the borrower has shown, but in fact loss.
As a result of the collapse, thousands of jobs disappeared, the market value was more than $60 billion, and the value of pension plans decreased by more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, Enron’s founder and former CEO, Jeffrey Skilling, was convicted last year of a felony committed in the company’s bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently serving more than 24 years in prison.
The conspiracy, fraud, and other charges against Lay ended with the man's death last year.
There is no poverty in Moscow.
Starting at $54 million, a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine makes its way between Moscow and Los Angeles without interruption, with a tank.
But this amount is only a small sum for some Russian rich people.
“There are 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But no one orders so many meetings because the machines are purchased for private families or corporate executives.”
Mr. Firer counted on the visitors at the four-day, exclusive Milliomosok Market, which was held in the huge exhibition hall in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury yachts have been rented booths at the exhibition, hoping that the Russian newcomers will be interested in everything from Mahogany-covered yachts to diamond-covered 50 cents coolers.
Mr. Firer carefully observed the bright orange-yellow Porsche displayed at the booth next to him.
“It’s a nice car, but it doesn’t even fit in with our products,” he said.
“Private aircraft have the largest market in Russia after the United States.”
It seems that the Russian capital is swimming in money as Dallas did in the light of the time of the oil spill.
“We went through a similar process in the 1890s, when some American millionaires went to Europe. These Americans were considered materialistic here,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior fellow at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians have now emerged as the world’s most spectacular spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands require their share of the gold plated.
At a conference organized by the luxury industry in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, LVMH’s president, shared his views on how to sell high-value products in markets similar to Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes’ list of the richest people, Russia has a total of 53 billion people, totaling $282 billion.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reaches 103,000, who can earn a total of $670 billion, has been determined by a personal well-being development analysis conducted in the territory of the former Soviet Union, the Faculty of Economic and Financial Research.
(According to World Bank data, in 2005, the number of people living below the minimum was 15.8 percent.)
“There are hundreds of millions of people living in Moscow, and that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative for London’s David Morris jewelry store.
For the first time, Nicole participated in the market with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
“All women are inexorably educated, and men are a real treasure trove.”
Two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, dressed up in their evening gowns on Sunday evening, were all self-employed and their clients were millionaires.
“I’ve seen the cars and I’m trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Yumatova, a young man who’s dressed in a darkly swirled, unique design, as if he’d already been used to it.
The market was primarily for the newly-rich, brand-oriented Russian buyers who are willing to spend several hours in the market to tour a lively, cipher-decorated place where they can find cadillac escalators, jalapenos, jalapenos, jalapenos, jalapenos
For the average person, the ticket costs 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who took his place as a patriot at the Dutch porcelain manufacturer, Royal Delft, opposite a wall-sized, hand-decorated, blue exchange paint.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in spectacular things."
Indeed, the sellers here said that for a long time (based on the Russian standards this means 10-15 years) rich Russians had already passed through the exhausting logos on such a bagatel, made in limited editions to brands that would not be able to get into a frame.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaires, and tourists, filled the place every day.
And some of them were bought.
On the first day of the show, on Thursday, Roman Ershov, the director of the company that manufactures King Koil beds, said he sold two mattresses, each worth $70,000, made of silk, cashmere and cotton.
Also on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales employee of A1 Moto dealing with the supply of high-quality cars with a modern alarm clock, reported that the company sold the bright orange one-millimeter Porsche for $170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, L.A. Connection’s president, luxury car manufacturer that delivers a solution to your individual needs, has sold three cooling wheels for the Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday afternoon. The grids are similar to connected chain ties.
Reporters also showed a wheel made for a Russian casino owner, which Swarovski said he was wearing crystals to create the appearance of a roulette wheel.
The price of a set of four pieces is $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants a picture of his wife's face and wheels made of straw, made of zirconia, will not necessarily use these objects," Karapetian said.
"Helyette's going to keep them in the garage guarding 30-40 cars."
Despite the fact that many of his Russian clients are wealthy, according to Karapetian, the term “Russian millionaire” today does not mean a great privilege, given the rapid rise of the properties there.
“Anyone who bought real estate in Moscow four or five years ago is now likely to be millions, if not in money, but at least on paper,” he said.
"There's more to it than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least have the appearance of wealth in front of the booth of the Russian asset management company Alliance Continental.
The company has built four English-style telephone booths, which were stacked with millions of fake dollar banks.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 counterfeit banknotes for the Milliomosok Market.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with the money. Many took photos of themselves with a mobile phone as they covered in a lot of money, or just pocketed a few million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Karryev said.
Medical Mistakes Suspected of Death in a New Jersey Death
The day before Thanksgiving, Ronald Livingston looked out the window of a restaurant called "Just a Little Healthier" and saw a rescue car stop at Cape Cod with two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Not long after, a police patrol car arrived.
Then another one.
"Then I saw your doctor's car stop," said Mr. Livingston, one of the supervisors at the restaurant.
"Then I knew someone was dead."
Authorities found out that the deceased woman was 41 years old, named Olga Arroyo, who had previously worked as an assistant to the chief of police in Newark.
The investigation is currently underway to determine whether the death was caused by an intervention by a cosmetic surgeon, who worked without a permit under West Scott Avenue 212, who was not identified by the police.
Authorities have not yet been able to find out what caused Arroya's death, but they hope that the results of toxicology tests available in a few weeks will shed light on this mysterious death, which has affected her with great pain in her self-regime.
Arroyo, whose voice has been heard by many in the department, has worked as an assistant since September 2006 alongside Garry F. McCarthy, the director of police.
"He was loyal, diligent, and trustworthy," McCarthy Arroyo said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
". She was my maid.
He was my protector.”
McCarthy said Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former police officer in Newwark, who was currently working on the Committee on the Control of Agricultural Products, and left behind two, a 14-year-old and an 11-year-old boy, as well as a widower.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators are working to find out whether Ms. Arroyo was the victim of surgery by an unlicensed surgeon.
"He laughs at the probability," Walsh said.
"The investigation is currently ongoing."
Reports from the authorities indicate that they arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November
21 and Mrs. Arroyo were found on the couch.
They've already been declared dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed and the police have so far reported very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't talk about Castro being heard by the detectives.
Participants of the study are looking into whether a part of the house has functioned as a medical director.
On Wednesday, no one opened a door in Castro's home, where a slender rose stood in the narrow front yard and a dalmatian snorted from the back of the house.
Next to the door leading into the cellar, in the entrance there was a blue container with the inscription "Etil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilla in food and perfumes.
Two mountain bikes from the campgrounds turned to the side.
McCarthy recalled that when she first arrived in Newark after 25 years at the New York City Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable in helping her navigate the new city’s unusual and unspoilt political culture.
"He always said, 'It's better to take care of this and that,'" he recalled.
“He was always here when I arrived in the morning, and he was always inside when I left at night.
It was embarrassing.”
Expectations of the Fed’s interest rate cut lead to a slowdown in the world’s equity markets
Stocks surged on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the U.S. Central Bank’s reassuring statements by its vice-president raised hopes that the Fed will try to ease investment opportunities with further interest-rate cuts.
Stock markets in both London and New York and across Europe have collapsed after Donald Kohn, who has declared that he is the right-hand man of the Fed President Ben Bernanke, has to react “flexively and pragmatically” to the financial markets constantly being watched.
In addition to Kohn’s clear goal of slowing markets amid signs of a resurgence in credit crisis, he stated that the current unrest “in part brought back the market’s progress at the end of September and October.”
He said that if the growing confusion persists, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on the credit conditions of households and companies, he said.
The statements were interpreted by investors as meaning that the Fed is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets or even further interest-rate cuts to stabilise credit conditions.
The announcements also had a reassuring effect on Wall Street, which has received more bad news about the U.S. economy lately, such as a negative record for the number of U.S. housing losses.
The report by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, has also confirmed the side effect of the financial turmoil, with a view to countering losses in the U.S. secondary-market housing sector, as part of the cost reduction of 650 workers or 4 jobs globally.
The above measure affects a total of 20 jobs in London, which employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average index rose by 331 points, 2.55 percent, and closed by 13,289.40 points, while the wider S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, 2.7 percent, and closed at 6,306.2, increasing the value of British blue-chip companies by more than 39 pounds.
The German Dax grew by 2.6 percent, while the French CAC40 grew by 2.3 percent.
The credit market dissatisfaction was renewed after the large-scale auction organised by the European Central Bank of the three-month running period of securities, which had not been seen since April 2001, was held at a price of 4,7 % for the European banks.
After the UK’s interbank interest rate, Libor reached its highest value since September, at 6.59 percent, after an even increase in the level experienced since November 12, the Bank of England was increasingly under pressure to keep pace with the Fed and the ECB.
In England, a decision is required between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
He gave two dilemmas, one more complex than the other.
Who should be the English team of six in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in the context of the first test against Sri Lanka, it is not less important, who will make the decision?
The latter question is relevant on the one hand, because David Graveney, the president of the selectors, who temporarily completes this particular task, is providing assistance to the head coach Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan in the decision. On the other hand, he is reluctant to do so, because he is reluctant to do so.
Of the two players, the draw is shorter, which does not receive the sixth place, but as is known, life, and especially the sport is often unfair.
It’s never easy to tell what makes one’s career a success, while others can’t get past even a lower level. Often it depends on luck than on talent.
Not only is it typical of cricket that it is difficult to choose - often on a subjective basis - to do so.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to look at Shah when this happens?
The same question may arise in other areas of life, for example, when we say John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, who has two smart, excellent qualifications, put a young leader who knows the business well in front of decision-makers, while there are only two of them.
Who can tell you what level a cricketer would go to without getting thrown into the deep water in a more serious race?
Of course, the data is greatly influenced by the decision, but the possibilities are equally important.
In a team, the player must capture the captain's gaze at the cricket cap at the right moment, and a batsman must regularly get a chance if he wants to become a great player once.
It is much more difficult to capture the eyes of the voters.
James Anderson, for example, played better last season, yet he is a confident team member in the first Test, despite Stephen Harmison's own words that he's in good shape and he's doing very well.
Anderson struggled with 32 first-class goals and 33 runs to take part in the tour.
Chris Tremlett only shot 29, but both of them had their moments of success at the highest level, and he hopes that they will be one in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will be playing at Asgiriya Stadium, this will be decided based on feedback.
This decision can overwhelm or break anyone’s career, but it can also happen that it won’t have a special impact on the future.
Four years ago, Sri Lankan Gareth Batty played every test and performed well with five goals and 40 assists, but it was Paul Collingwood, who had been there at the time, who became an outstanding and decisive test cricketer, who could still be there today.
It is likely that in the Asgiriya Stanion during today’s game, they will be able to listen to their conservative feelings of Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, in addition to Shah’s greater experience of voxus, with Bopara’s youthful vitality and dynamism.
There are arguments on both sides.
In addition to Shah, he made his brilliant and successful debut in the 88th Bombay Test Quarters. He is seven years younger than his 22-year-old Bopara, who also scored 32 first-class goals in excellent twisting throws.
However, the fact that Middlesex player Shah was at home in May, in the test run at Lorda against the West Indies in two quarters was only ten runs, as well as the fact that Vaughan, who was fighting for his next role in the next game, clashed with his opponent in a fight against him immediately.
In contrast to him, Essex’s universal talent is a life-saver and unsurpassed player.
There’s nothing to worry about on the cricket pitch, but he was well-characterized by his behavior on the off-track when he showed up at an exhibition with a four-wheeler for the team’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and was probably shocked. However, the first thing he did after that was he took in his (of course sponsored) Vodafone phone and called his teammate from a distance, Alastair Cook, "Did you get this?"
Bopara is a better player with a better track track with classics. With his mid-sliding moves, he creates an advantage in pitching, and his hits are confident and skillful.
Choosing the right person is one thing and another is the right moment.
Perhaps this is the true art of choice.
Personally, I would give Bopara a chance now, which doesn't mean that I don't think Shah would offer a standout if, as the Ceylon Tea League suggests, he's the one who plays on the weekends.
Buses transport refugees home to work and take up the fight with Al-Qaeda
Since yesterday, the first buses from Syria to Baghdad have arrived with those Iraqi refugees who have lost their money or expired their visas, or those who are actually hoping to return to the city.
There are some among them who have returned to take up the fight with the soldiers who have driven them out of their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already full of refugees from Syria and Jordan before 800 people, dozens of busloads, arrived in a government convoy from Damascus.
“I then decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” said Dr. Sabah al-Qubaisi.
"Today I came back because I saw what happened in Baghdad on TV and in the newspapers and that the city is now safe.
“They say the Mahdi army stopped by killing people,” he added, referring to a military priest named Moqtada al-Sadr, who is currently suspending his ski army.
The 38-year-old Shiite teacher, Qassim al-Atwani, who was mostly Sunni, came home with his two children because he was unable to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented the Iraqis from taking the job.
Amari’s ski neighbors phoned him and urged him to return home, saying the U.S.-backed forces had managed to evict Al-Qaeda from their stronghold in the western part of the capital.
One of the first to arrive from Jordan was a Sunni and Shia tribal leader who fled a grenade attack from his home in northern Baghdad's Sleikh after his fellow citizens began provoking the fight against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, my friends called and told me that they had formed an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed my support and my sons.
That’s why I came back today,” said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
A lot of people have talked about the fact that since the U.S. troops entered the capital, they have been lured home by armed civilian forces working with the Americans.
But many more were forced to return home from Damascus because of problems with my visa and my financial situation.
The 51-year-old, three-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai has given a voice to a wide-ranging view among the refugees that the Syrian government has asked the Shiite prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, to reject the refugees’ visa application if he is willing to do so.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the country’s death squads.
"It was all right until al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government not to issue more visas for Iraqis in order for them to return home," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports those criminals who burned down my house after I escaped," he said.
One of the reasons for the escalation of the violence was that the Sunnis were expelled from the ski areas, while the skis were also removed from the Sunni-occupied areas. As a result, tension decreased in many regions.
Many believe that the sudden appearance of the refugees will upset the tastes again, which can lead to even more fights.
Small Saarland - level training
The smallest federal province plays a leading role in the field of vocational training, as well as its higher education with an international orientation.
In only one area of training, the island regions are struggling with the same shortages as the rest of the country.
“Yesterday, I explained fifty times outside a Saarland that we are not French,” the self-Ironic Slogan said on his poster for the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system of the Saarland, which can be praised by the fifth floor according to the surveys of the German Economic Institute (IW) in Cologne.
In this way, the institutions of higher education - only because of the traditions - cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbr<0xC3><0xBC>cken was founded by the French in 1948.
Students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma to this day.
As a result, the proportion of foreign students is high by 15.6 percent.
However, the Saar region’s universities and universities also have an above-average attractiveness to learn about the desires of the Saar region – many of them without a high school diploma.
“In the Saar region, they take advantage of the opportunities for vocational training,” explains Axel Pl<0xC3><0xBC>nnecke, an education expert at the German Economic Institute.
In more than one-fifth of vocational schools, young people have the right to further education, with the Saar region exceeding the federal average by more than seven percent.
The combined possibilities of vocational and higher education have also been well designed.
In terms of population, the infrastructure for double studies is ranked second in Germany.
Despite practice-oriented training and growing interest, however, the number of graduate engineers has decreased by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Ministry of Education in the Saarland has committed to the marketing of higher education institutions, the focus of which is the engineering sciences.
“In general schools, we have initiated a number of reforms after the first Pisa study,” said a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests across the country.
In order for the children to start studying earlier, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge. This is a model that in the meantime began to be copied by the other federal provinces.
In order to ensure that the performance of students is continuously improved, only comparative studies in the future will give an answer.
According to the 2003 Pisa survey, the proportion of students at risk decreased from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the performance of the Saar region has not improved to an extent similar to that of the other federal regions.
Bugs count better.
The greatest vendetta of the island regions during the Pisa survey does not take into account the knowledge of the foreign language - otherwise, they could search for baberie in this area, by the way,
because the language of the neighboring countries is a compulsory subject in the gymnasiums - even if the island-regions are not French.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is changing the clocks
In Venezuela, in the near future, the clocks are different than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez will turn the clocks back in Latin America in half an hour.
Meanwhile, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez has become a laughing stock in Spain.
According to a new law, according to Venezuela’s official newspaper, Greenwich time is back by four and a half hours compared to Greenwich time.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not in use in any other country in the world.
Chavez, who opposed the United States, argued, among other things, that time zones based on hours were forced into the world by the United States.
In addition, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez (local time) on Wednesday announced the severance of relations with neighboring Colombia due to a hostage.
The left-wing nationalist politician said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he has no contact with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this because of my own dignity," said Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform, which the citizens of the oil country must make an opinion on Sunday within the framework of a referendum.
With the reform, it would significantly build up its power in the country.
The cause of the debate was Uribe’s decision to withdraw from Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez’s mandate to allow hostages to be released in negotiations with Colombian Marxist rebels.
In Uribe’s decision, he “bought face” Venezuela, giving voice to his criticism of Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez.
In the country, a new mobile ringtone has made an appearance: "Por que no te callas" (Why don't you shut your mouth), - so sounds the phrase, which has already been spent by more than half a million people on the Internet.
The saying comes from J<0xC3><0xA1>nos K<0xC3><0xA1>roly, king of Spain, who, at the last Latin American summit, was so upset by the constant mediocrity of the populist left-wing politician that he cut into his own words.
In 2007, the German government threatened to cut wages.
According to a forecast, this year’s real wage cuts threaten German workers despite the strong economic situation.
Experts have relied on their pessimistic forecasts for all sorts of reasons.
According to the calculations of the Hans-Br<0xC3><0xB6>ckler Foundation, in 2007 employees can actually count on fewer payments than in the previous year.
“This modest wage development, the increase in general turnover taxes, and the rapid rise in food and energy prices are the cause,” Gustav Horn, a fellow of the Institute for Macroeconomic and Economic Research, told Bild.
In the case of unemployment insurance, further burdens may be imposed on the workers.
Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck, the finance minister, said in a statement to the Neue Osnabr<0xC3><0xBC>cker Zeitung newspaper that the current situation would reduce unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the beginning of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be put in such a difficult situation that it can proceed to the Federation for credit or support, the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD politician, was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it became known that the collapse of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation in 13 years.
Compared to the previous year, prices have risen by 3 percent.
Venus is the devil's twin brother on Earth.
Despite the harsh climate of Venus, it is more similar to Earth than previously assumed: In its atmosphere, the European "Venus Express" spacecraft discovered lightning strikes, and in its corners discovered wind gusts such as those that occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that Venus will be lit up.
The European "Venus Express" spacecraft provided evidence - discovered electromagnetic waves on the periphery of the atmosphere: The flashes that occur on Venus are spread from cloud to cloud at a height of 56 kilometers, reports the scientific journal "Nature" of the work of the "Christophein" of Christ.
According to the famous "autumn theory", the formation of Earth's life was caused by lightning: According to the theory, zivatars initiated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: “If life ever existed there, it could have been in very early times,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Currently, there can hardly be a living organism on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere around the circle is a hundred times denser than on Earth, and the temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
“Venus may be the twin brother of hell on Earth, but it’s still the twin brother,” Russel said.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus, so similar in mass and size to Earth, is moving on a completely different path of development.
The launch of the Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the search for Venus, because since the early 1990s, no probe has been on its way to explore this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results presented in several "Nature" articles have not only proved the uniqueness of the Venusian Solar System.
“They also point out that the similarity of the neighboring planet to Earth is greater than we first assumed,” Esa said.
In addition to the already well-known north-south arctic wind, the researchers also discovered an even faster-moving cloud movement on the southern arc.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents of the Earth’s winter hemisphere, says the research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Astrophysics Spaziale e Physica Cosmica.
The mass of the second largest planet in the Solar System is almost the same as the Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, it is almost the size of the Earth.
The celestial body, also called the Esthajnal Star, escapes the Sun in as little as 225 days.
However, it turns much more slowly around its own sea: an ancient day lasts for 243 Earth days.
Although the surface temperature of 460 degrees Fahrenheit, which is at 92 bar, is hardly reminiscent of the Earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under completely similar conditions.
Both of them collected water, which remained as an ocean on Earth, while Venus left for the universe.
And while on Earth, carbon dioxide is bound up in carbonaceous rocks, so far on Venus, it makes up a large part of the atmosphere.
K<0xC3><0xB6>hler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama
K<0xC3><0xB6>hler, the President of the German Republic, calls for an end to the dispute between the parties that erupted around the reception in the office of the Dalai Lama’s office.
In a mediated manner, he criticized the SPD for attacking the chancellor after the September admissions.
German President Horst K<0xC3><0xB6>hler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and has called on the coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama’s admission.
“In this matter, we should not be appearing as a divided nation towards the outside world,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
K<0xC3><0xB6>hler also expressed his understanding that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) had accepted the Dalai Lama in September.
“Human rights are universally applicable to me even if I respect the difference between cultures,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
Everyone is aware that Germany must take care of the foreign-policy balance, stressed the President of the Republic; however, Merkel’s defense came against the accusation that the chancellor would pursue a new Chinese policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not broken away from the traditional 'one China' policy.
China is also aware of this," K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) has indirectly voiced his disapproval of the Dalai Lama’s admission and has therefore become the target of attacks in the ranks of the EU.
Steinmeier, among other things, complained about the EU's "policy of expulsion" in the foreign policy area.
Following the acceptance of the Dalai Lama in the office of the chancellor, there were serious disturbances in German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only rejected the invitation of the German finance minister, Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck (SPD), but also, according to SPIEGEL, frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the two countries’ foreign ministry.
Wen Jiabao, China’s head of state, has just called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that it was a mistake to accept the Dalai Lama.
China refuses to accept the leader of the Tibetan religion in their official capacity by European politicians, Wen Jiabao has confirmed China’s position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama have pointed out that it is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan territories, which include China and other present-day provinces.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble protects against disturbances similar to those of France
Street clashes with police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble is protected from disturbances similar to those of France.
Everything must be done to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from escalating into street violence, demands the Federal Interior Minister.
Barricades have been set on fire, randalizers have shot at police officers with a belligerent gun: The Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble (CDU) has seen similar developments in Germany after the severe unrest of young people in France.
“We need to make sure that the social explosives don’t accumulate and don’t resort to violence.
We need to take this seriously," he told the "Neue Presse" newspaper in Hannover.
Not all young people adapt to the rapid changes in social reality.
Alliances, provinces and communities are currently working intensively to solve the problem cases, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, only the first successes have been shown," he said.
However, it is too early to resolve the emergency.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble also pointed out that in German suburbs there are no architectural and sociological problems such as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris last night, the young people fought heavy street battles with the police.
Cars and public buildings were also set on fire in Toulouse.
In view of all this, the head of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded a greater degree of activity in the area of integration from the federal government.
In connection with the riots in France, Kolat warned of the "danger of persecution".
Although the situation in Germany is not as comfortable as in France,
Nevertheless, action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that among young people under the age of 25 from immigrant families, the unemployment rate is “higher than the average”.
First of all, you need to take care of more educational places.
Kolat stressed: "We need to provide a perspective for young people."
However, the head of the Turkish Community added that "social supervision within the family" is much more present in Germany than in France.
In addition, many young people from an immigrant family do not want to ruin what their parents built here.
Kolat warns, "We must be honest, though."
Young people need to be given the opportunity to work and have access to education as quickly as possible.
Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Paris, in Villiers-le-Bel, during the night, there was complete peace.
Hundreds of police officers were about to enter the area, and a helicopter lighted the area.
The competent authorities have issued a report on the three arrests, as well as on some of the burning garbage cans and cars.
Since the report, a security unit consisting of 1,000 people has been providing peace of mind.
The police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after her visit to the suburb.
Over the course of the night on Tuesday, 80 police officers were injured in the surrounding area as a result of the riots in Villiers-le-Bel-.
The next night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The tremors broke out in connection with a traffic accident during which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the Public Prosecutor’s Office’s first findings, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.

The chancellor’s act, which has been derailed from reality, is proof that the coalition is coming to an end – and nothing can be expected of it.
Which country does the Federal Chancellor live in? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In the general debate of the Bundestag, it is necessary to establish, in terms of its content, after its ordinary and utter action: not here - not in the country whose governance would be his.
Angela Merkel has dismissed the accusation with a very strong statement that she would focus too much on foreign policy.
This is provincial, he replied, and in this way he only expressed that he did not want to understand what the critics were talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how far-reaching the eyelashes are.
In the meantime, no specific interest or empathy was felt for the country’s problems.
Instead, there appeared the Skywalker Angela: a politician who was torn away from reality who fled to foreign policy and there was only uncertainty of his own.
An example of climate protection: Heiligendammi is constantly praising itself for its decisions, but is listening to how the country should achieve its climate goals.
In any case, as far as self-pity is concerned, this kind of unhappiness would not have been allowed by the President of the CDU two years earlier.
Now, it falls into the phrase that prosperity has had a positive effect on people.
This has damaged his good news as a pragmatic personality, which provides a solution to the problems instead of the proverbs.
However, in the reign of skyscraper Angela, the internal political problems are only secondary things.
Child poverty and the problems of low income earners?
This is only worth a few half-truths.
There is much to be said in this regard about the severity of language abuse when it comes to family allowances.
Three times, Merkel has to work hard to put together a half-assed sentence.
When it comes to specifics, you're in a foreign territory.

During the Republican presidential debate on YouTube, the two favourites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, had a hard-fought turnaround — and now they have to be held by an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates has already broken on the surface with regard to the first topic.
Mitt Romney said his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, had made New York "a nightmare for illegal immigrants."
Those who, on their part, counteract serious facts: “I would say that his own house served as a refuge for illegal immigrants,” Giuliani cuts back, and he laments in the eyes of his former governor of Massachusetts that he was treating undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are on the run: As the Republican camp still does not have a uniformly-supported favorite, the eight presidential hopefuls’ debate on CNN is primarily used to undermine his opponent’s faith.
The 30-second videos sent by internet users via YouTube in their own way are hardly more than short summaries.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have brought Hitler to power," John McCain said, under the banner of the opposition, Ron Paul, who is the only one in the circle to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney has also thoroughly washed his head of Vietnam on a veteran who has passed away when he refuses to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding" as torture, a method of interrogation during which he is simulated to catch water.
Yet, the campaign’s important themes are far beyond the debates on Iraq and the torture that have taken place in the past, according to the reactions of the St. Petersburg audience in Florida.
Loud taps break out in the room when praising conservative values and rejecting future tax increases.
In the meantime, the weak of the two candidates are becoming more and more apparent.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney pleaded guilty, and apologized to supporters and television viewers for having her voice cut off in 1994 while she was still pregnant.
Giuliani, on the other hand, persists when he requests his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first ruled as a civilian
One day after the army's withdrawal from power, a coup d'état took place in Pakistan to overthrow Musharraf, who was in power as president.
With this eight-year military rule comes to an end in Pakistan.
Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, was sworn in for a further five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the capital, Islamabad's presidential palace, in the country's capital.
Musharraf has sworn in to the constitution and to act for the good of his people.
He handed over his military leadership office on Wednesday to Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus allowed international pressure to come from the United States first and foremost.
The former general, after eight years without bloodshed, is now ruling as a first-class civilian head of state in the form of a military coup.
Musharraf, acting as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, fulfilled a fundamental demand of the West and the opposition.
Another important demand is the abolition of the state of emergency announced by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will soon end the state of emergency, with which he fulfills a further demand from the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, in which Musharraf had planted sympathising lawyers in early November following the announcement of the state of emergency, rejected any protests last week over the head of state’s disputed re-election on October 6.
Meanwhile, in the tribal area in the north, North-Vaziristan, five soldiers were killed and another four were injured as a result of a military convoy.
According to a military spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghan border.
Krautrock's parents are coming back.
The German supergroup from the 1970s is playing again: Harmonia’s three band members re-recorded their instrument until a Berlin concert.
On the occasion of the re-composition, a cut recording appears from their light age, from the time of "Live 1974".
At the time, they were much better known abroad.
The notified sensation killed the body in the person of the three agreed gentlemen in the dining table.
Each has its own instrument, its own cable and first of all its own buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle of a snow-white throne.
Michael Rother, a 57-year-old young man from the left, offers support in the possession of a laptop and guitar.
Looking from the right side of the audience, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius is leaning and concentrating on the console.
Each of them produces some kind of noise, while also producing a rhythm once in a while.
And all of this is sometimes made up of some sort of random traditional music.
This, however, seems not to bother the gentlemen themselves in any particular way.
It was a great thrill for fans of the krautrock musical direction that the Harmonia band is playing music again.
What we can tell you here: As a result of a proper follow-up, we can conclude that the name has been passed on to the collective pop memory, but in no way has it left any lasting traces that this band will be sorely missed after 32 years.
But why can't the Germans celebrate the living legends of their 70s?
Above all, what we call misleading krautrock has always been valued more in England and America than in its own country.
When the music industry in Cologne awarded the Echo Award in 2003 to the members of the band Can still alive, the German pop figures sat in the room with a meaningless face.
When, in the Red Hot Chili Peppers, he even thanked La D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf and Neu!, the admiration became limitless.
At the concerts, Michael Rother sat on the stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
The two sides of the coin are the same coin of domestic rejection and foreign acceptance.
The memory is already overloaded with Harmony, because the trio only existed for two years, and during this time it had a far smaller impact than any other time afterwards attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed together with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the much-promising Cluster name.
Initially, they played in the basement of the Schaub<0xC3><0xBC>hne Theater in Berlin.
Then in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf, from economic considerations to a record company funded by the church.
Rother has been helping the band Kraftwerk for a short time, and at the same time, perhaps the most progressive German band, Neu!, gained a reputation as a guitarist.
However, in 1973, Rother followed the Cluster's music into their rendition at the Weserbergland Forest.
There, in Alter Weserhof, they lived in a 16th-century Rom as a commune escaped from the city.
It was less ideological than in the First Commune, where Roedelius was still a babysitter.
They're more of an idyllic artist.
It is said that the flag of Harmonia Ottenstein was created from the garbage and they found the name of their art in this way.
Some of these things have been recorded by Harmonia.
The first album is titled "Musik von Harmonia" and the next "De Luxe".
Despite the soft and gentle music, the band suffered a material need.
The collection of copper on its own did not ensure that it was found for itself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record-breaking audience of almost 50 people, so one remembers.
The compulsion and occasional practice of Harmony was Rother's idea at the time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an unethical demand.
The band announced their split in 1975.
Rother recorded at the esoteric and kept himself from albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
The Cluster was revived in the 1980s, which has since been more successful than Harmony has ever been.
The live album of Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nemeyer is due to Herbert Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nemeyer.
His record company, Greenland, set out to take care of the krautrock as a special German supplement to his live music.
In this context, Neu! was also presented in the same way as Roedelius’ solo work.
The resurgence of Harmony takes place in the House of Cultures in Berlin.
Money, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the author of the book "Krautrock Sampler", is also present.
There is also the idea manager of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
This largely outlines the effect of krautrock on the coming pop eras.
In this regard, Harmonia fills an empty space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno’s statement, along with the most unusual sounds, floats in the room: “The only true music, its own future.”
They have pictures that depict the producer in the room of a farmhouse with Harmony.
Removing additional black-and-white photos from the cabled equipment of the cube serves to build a legend.
In the foreground, the three veterans are resuming improvisation.
This is just what makes them attach microphones to the organ and to the drum kit with the intention of squeezing out sound effects that have not yet been heard from the instruments with the help of instruments that produce sound effects of their own scale.
Today, electric music is like electric music.
Three, deep-tech handcuffs.
Even the housewife doesn’t change anything.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgenstern, they kiss and kiss and sing "Aaaaaaaah!" in a beautiful voice.
Because krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought after in blues than in music colleges (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or precisely in the avoidance of artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here yells "'68!", he's not going in the wrong way, and Harmony doesn't even let himself out of his composure yet.
Even the most obvious thing about yourself is being thoroughly rethought on the stage.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
This can be nerve-wracking, or it can smother a person with moments of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
Through the "Fraud" and the "M<0xC3><0xB6>rderischer Frieden", two films are again engaged in the Balkan War.
However, neither of them is convinced.
The basic idea is either too focused on action and shooting, or too sensitive to it.
Even Richard Gere himself can't help in the "Fraud."
First of all, the good news is that although the two war criminals, Karadzics and Mladics, are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, they found him again in the dark background of the Bosnian war on the actor, Richard Gere.
In recent times, we have mistaken the most beautiful man of the eighties, as he played a number of good-boy-nothing roles in emotional films about women, and a lot of press conferences on the subject of Buddhism have even taken our eye off him.
And here, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most compelling argument that we might still be watching the movie "Fighting."
It offers a wonderful, reassuring design: In essence, the Simon Hunt-designed mercenary is exactly what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry weren’t so nice to him: A man who has spent his most beautiful years behind bars, but he’s left a tear behind him for a long time.
However, the film "Fraud" and also this week's German production of "M<0xC3><0xB6>rderischer Frieden", which began to be vetoed, continues an endless series of failed films about the Balkan war.
The movie "M<0xC3><0xB6>rderischer Frieden" does not have to lose a lot of words: The film is about two German soldiers serving in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serbian woman from the Kosovo snipers, and one of them is suddenly introduced as a broadcast.
While it’s welcome that Serbs aren’t portrayed as the only cause of all the bad, the film that carries the inadequacy of TV movies is too quickly lost in shooting and eventful scenes.
It carries the "Cobra 11" character - a highway instead of a war.
On the other hand, in the case of the "Vad<0xC3><0xA1>szat" it is possible to examine, for example, why no really good film about the Balkan war has been made yet.
The story of the three U.S. military recruits who are about to embark on a quest to find the Serbian war criminal, another director, another scriptwriter (both in Richard Shepard's personal union), in a new era in a new era.
For the stories show a surprising similarity: in both cases, small groups cut him into the forest to accomplish what the army is unable to do - and in both cases, the journey into madness is round.
One of the reasons for the failure of the "Fight" is that he simply doesn't let Simon Hunt be the downtrodden cynic who listens to his heart as he introduces him at the beginning.
No, and in the screenplay, he even spends a romantic relationship with one of the later murdered Muslim Bosnian women.
The "Fight" is finally slipping away when the reporters in the form of an accelerated shooting of the last five minutes of the film achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the major powers of the world have not been able to do in five years: they'll catch the war criminal from the brink of the abyss.
It is so bad that one would rather turn to the Hague International Court of Justice for a crime against the logic of cinema.
The purpose of the film is deeply human.
He intends to claim that Karadzics and Mladics are still at large, and by suspecting the Americans and the French (in this case, they are exceptionally united) that they are not pursuing the persecution intensively enough because of their secret political structures.
But the good and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht verse comes to mind.
In this poem, the poet writes about the famous Asian demon depicted on his desk: "I look at the dizzying heresy on the face of the beast, which tells me: what a burden it is to be poor."
Films like "Fight" have the same oversized, human-headed masks, which, however, show how exhausting it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan war.
It was recently reported in the newspaper that all of the Hollywood films about Iraq were a horrendous failure.
We can add: There hasn’t been a good movie about South Africa yet.
Almost always valid: If a star is playing in the world’s crisis arenas or minefields, then something like “The Paths of Freedom” with Patricia Arquette, the “Without Borders” with Angelina Jolie or the “Blood Diamond” with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close in terms of time.
They had to spend decades while Hollywood was able to shoot a good movie about the Holocaust with the "Schindler List".
Probably a few films are still in the works - since the works on the Vietnam War, which are now considered classics, such as "The Horn Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" films have not been celebrated as a solo artist in their time.
But it is conceivable that today, when all mass murder comes to our home through two screens in real time, we simply know too much about the conflicts of the world.
And this takes away the scripts from ignoring the reality that would be needed to tell the good stories.
Because "To Be or Not to Be" or "The Dictator" eventually succeeded so well, because Lubitsch and Chaplin had not yet known how terrible the Nazi regime was actually.
Maybe you shouldn’t try to be good if you want to make a good movie.
Perhaps the novelist Lawrence Norfolk should be placed in a sarcastically remote artistic mode of vision.
When the historical novel Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re-lexicon, and the parallels between the Balkan war, told him, "It only depends on the fact that certain things never change.
The big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beusto has been widely criticized for canceling the Olympic Games
The mayor’s decision to hold the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has sparked a sharp criticism of his bid to host the Summer Olympics in political and economic life.
Many people want to continue to fight for the organization of water games.
Von Beust, on the other hand, warned about the realities in the course of the impossibility.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday called the withdrawal "unfavorable for the economic environment."
No other project has released such a huge motivational force in the city in recent times as the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, we would not be able to maintain the sporting momentum evenly.”
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative that "starts from modified timelines".
Mayor Ole von Beust, in addition to his earlier statements, said that his ambitions for the Hamburg Olympics were not realistic until at least 2028.
“It’s not Hamburg that decides on the Olympic bid, it’s the German Olympic Sports Federation,” von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation that was expected in early December on the Munich bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics.
“To benefit from this means so much to us that, as we have envisioned so far, we will not have any realistic chances within the period of 2028.”
However, we do not give up the dream at all, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) expressed its regret over von Beust’s statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg does not intend to host the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to kick a chance by burying our plans now,” HSB President G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Plo<0xC3><0x9F> said on Wednesday.
In addition, the withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement of the President of the Senate, which he made at the General Assembly of the German College of Sport.
There, Von Beust Hamburg’s bid for the 2015 University of Hamburg was characterised by the fact that it does not serve as a substitute for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The University of Hamburg Sports Association launched Hamburg last week as the city participating in the competition.
The SPD’s civic faction has told the Senate that it has left valuable time in terms of housing construction in Hamburg unexploited.
"Kleiner Grasbrook's development has been stalled by the Senate for years because he voted for the Olympics and followed the building," said two SPD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has consistently broken its threshold in relation to Kleiner Grasbrook along with the integrated plan for the Olympic and subsequent housing exploitation, the CDU has focused on the “event factor” on the one side.
At that time, the bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg was a great source of excitement.
However, he died in Hamburg Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes
The one who connects the concepts of Sweden and the village to each other is Ikea and not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, villages produced in Sweden put a dark shadow on Warhol’s list of works.
The ninety-four "Stockholm-type" Brillo Box listed in this list is largely counterfeit.
After a few months of the Swedish edition of "Expressen", there was no doubt about the originality of the Brillo Boxas in 1968, now the internal investigation of the Stockholm Moderna Museet has reached a groundbreaking result: the "Pontus Hultén", the former museum director of the "Box" in 1995, the "Box" in the "Box"
The prehistory is a long and complicated chain of artistic and curatorial presentations that is confusing.
In 1964, Warhol created the first "Brillo Box" in New York, a painted village based on a red-blue-white format of the "Brillo" soapbox.
Hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard (with the consent of Warhol) were exhibited at an exhibition in a 1968 Moderna Museet: these (for cost-saving reasons) were not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo carton factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their templates, simple pieces of exhibition.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission in 1968 for the production of some of the Brillo families in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time are now talking about fifteen boxes, which were then certified as Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box, under the designation "Stockholm-type", with the right to enter the history of art and auction.
Some of them were sold for more than $100,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director, later falsely claimed that in 1968, hundreds of villages were produced and exhibited in Sweden, which he then left for Warhol.
In fact, Hultén 105 boxes were only produced in 1990 in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> for a St. Petersburg exhibition.
By this time, however, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Bystr<0xC3><0xB6>m, the main curator of the Moderna Museet, has also examined three privately owned Swedish boxes, two of which were painted in Stockholm in 1968: The printed scrolls were first cut and stamped.
By contrast, the structure of the 1990 copies reveals that the paints were taken directly from the plate without foundation with a paint brush – and not with oil – but with acrylic paint.
"These boxes are not certified by the artist, so they should be removed from Andy Warhol's official list of Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museum, "Unless the New York's Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board decides otherwise.
The Authentication Board, of course, announced in June that it had raised “serious allegations” about post-Jar soapy cans.
Since then, however, they have been inundated with undemanding listening.
Manila's rebel soldiers surrender
They abandoned the rebellion in the Philippines by the soldiers who barricaded themselves in a Manila hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He can't take responsibility for the bloodshed, said Antonio Trillanes, the hotel's manager, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud.
Prior to this, government-run soldiers who had introduced gas-fired vehicles were shoved into the hotel.
The two thousand soldiers have been barricading themselves in the building for hours.
Half of the team was in court on Thursday for the 2003 shooting attempt, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly solve the wheel with 30 sympathisers.
The military police tasked with guarding the man apparently switched to him and joined the sledgehammer.
They infiltrated the Peninsula Hotel, and then demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government-controlled units have closed down the area of the outstanding hotel.
The president invited the security cabinet to an extraordinary session.
Security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“They have people,” Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was previously commander of the Scout Rangers elite corps, said other units in the army wanted to join the flight in a short time.
On Friday, the government was called upon by judges to strongly protest against the president.
His government has been shadowed by corruption charges for months.
The financial district of Manila was already the main stage of the 200-member military rounds of the Arroyo assassination attempt.
The uprising failed in less than 24 hours, when the army was reluctant to join.
Since 1986, at least seven gun tests have been carried out in the Philippines against democratically elected governments.
United Internet will be a big part of Versatel
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent stake in Versatel’s telecommunications company.
As the company announced on Wednesday evening, the average per share was 14.46 euros.
This represents 20.05 percent ownership of the fund.
Prior to the capture, encounters had already been made on the wing.
The possibility of raising the property acquired in Versatel remains open.
With this step, they want to promote the consolidation of the German DSL market, the United Internet reported.
Prior to this, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about a possible turn-on, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf’s network provider by an additional 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
The financial institution holds the share only to a third party, it is reported in the money market.
The previous day, the United Internet already owned a narrow 10 percent stake in the Drillisch mobile phone company.
Within the framework of growth, Drillisch posted 17.4 million new shares worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106.4 million.
Of this, United Internet purchased 5.15 million shares for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31.4 million.
In addition, the companies have initiated a dialogue on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile phone products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United-Internet spokesperson said in a statement.
The two companies jointly set up the MSP Joint Undertaking for the acquisition of competing Freenet.
The two companies are initially satisfied with the good ten percent stake in Freenet and do not live up to the right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies leave all options open, particularly with a view to raising the stake in Freenet AG, according to the news.
Negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet concluded on the strategic partnership in mid-November.
Freenet has been around for months now and is only a case-by-case poker game as part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
By the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contract mobile phone customers, as well as 1.27 million DSL and wired access customers.
The holding company created by United Internet and Drillisch has so far directly owned 6.01 percent stake in Freenet.
Now there is an agreement that the Drillisch will bring in four percent more rounds.
The agreement on the right to buy 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company was signed in August.
